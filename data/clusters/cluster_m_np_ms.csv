"Home ministry acknowledges weakness in Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 1: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, acknowledged weaknesses in three areas regarding the Balkumari incident that occurred on Friday, resulting in two casualties and physical losses. KATHMANDU, Jan 1: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, acknowledged weaknesses in three areas regarding the Balkumari incident that occurred on Friday, resulting in two casualties and physical losses. During a meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee in the House of Representatives today, the minister said that the initial conclusion on the incident highlighted the EPS Office Chief's role was not positive, the failure of the security officials assigned to the Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport in fulfilling their responsibilities, and a weakness on the part of the field commander of the Nepal Police. The individuals responsible have been suspended until the investigation into the matter concludes. According to the Minister, the Chief District Officer of Lalitpur has been temporarily transferred to the Ministry, and the District Police Chief to the Police Headquarters to facilitate the investigation process. ""One million rupees each has been announced for the families of the victims, with efforts underway to provide them additional relief from the EPS Fund and the Foreign Employment Board."" DPM Shrestha said that the Ministry recognized a weakness in the incident, leading to the formation of a Probe Committee. A circular has been issued, urging the avoidance of resorting to firing to control the situation as much as possible. Before taking any actions, it is necessary to assess the serious damage to the lives, government, and private property of the citizens, and it is advised to minimize the use of bullets, he stated. He also informed the meeting that a three-member Commission, chaired by former High Court judge Shekhar Poudel, has been formed to conduct an impartial and objective inquiry into the incident.

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

KATHMANDU, Jan 17: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has instructed the government bodies including the ministries concerned to promptly resolve the problems related to cooperatives. The PM issued this directive in the course of discussions held in Baluwatar this morning with officials of the related bodies, according to a press note issued by the PM’s Secretariat. The Prime Minister on the occasion said provisions should be made in the Act itself so as to promote the cooperatives as infusing the embryo of socialism and focussed on collectivism and the interests of the lowest section of society. He further added that the cooperatives should be made systematic by adopting immediate and long-term measures. He instructed the ministry and bodies concerned to carry out the required homework on an immediate and long-term basis for resolving the problems seen in cooperatives. Stating that his attention was drawn towards forming an effective regulatory body for the monitoring of cooperatives, PM Dahal directed the existing cooperatives regulatory agencies to present a report, classifying the cooperatives as well-performing, in crisis and bankrupt. He called for paying attention to the security of the amount kept by depositors in the cooperatives, pointing out the need for taking effective steps in coordination of all the three tiers of the government for this.

Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government.

At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties.

Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.6209370222352804,False

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.7279327313296319,False
"Govt adding unnecessary layer for financial aid distribution to martyrs’ families by establishing a commission KATHMANDU, Jan 17: The government is gearing up to establish a commission dedicated to disbursing financial aid to the families of martyrs. Sources at the Prime Minister's Office said that a commission, set to be announced soon, will be formed specifically for the distribution of financial assistance in honor of the martyrs. Discussions regarding the commission's formation are underway in the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is anticipated that the commission will be officially established in the near future to facilitate financial support for the families of the martyrs. KATHMANDU, Jan 17: The government is gearing up to establish a commission dedicated to disbursing financial aid to the families of martyrs. Sources at the Prime Minister's Office said that a commission, set to be announced soon, will be formed specifically for the distribution of financial assistance in honor of the martyrs. Discussions regarding the commission's formation are underway in the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is anticipated that the commission will be officially established in the near future to facilitate financial support for the families of the martyrs. According to sources, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Deputy Prime Minister/Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha have reached an agreement to establish the commission for distributing financial aid to the families of the martyrs. Currently, Home Minister Shrestha is in the process of discussing the commission's formation, as it requires approval from the home ministry and subsequently the council of ministers. But the officials of the home ministry have expressed their disagreement towards the formation of such a commission. High-ranking officials of the home ministry are against the idea of forming such a commission despite Home Minister Shrestha instructing them to initiate the process. They argue that the idea of distributing financial aid through the formation of such a commission could be detrimental to the government. The government has been providing one million rupees in financial aid to the families of martyrs without the approval from a formal commission. However, a new initiative is underway to form a commission that will provide additional financial support in the name of martyrs, supplementing the existing one million rupees in assistance. This move comes in response to a rising trend in the country where there is pressure to declare individuals who lose their lives in conflicts and accidents as martyrs, making them eligible for a financial assistance of one million rupees. Labeling individuals as martyrs without adhering to the necessary criteria is considered disrespectful to genuine martyrs. The ongoing dispute centers on the definition of who qualifies as a martyr and who does not. Following the 2006/07 people's movement, the government established two commissions to address this issue, but as of now, the recommendations from these commissions have not been implemented. The government has not even made that report public. But the ministry sources claim that the one that is being built now is purely for the distribution of financial aid. After the controversy and debate about who should be considered a martyr started, the government formed a commission under the chairmanship of the then UML leader Modanath Prashrit. The commission formed under the coordination of former minister Prasrit submitted its report on December 1, 2009 while another commission formed under the chairmanship of Nawaraj Subedi submitted its report in 2011. But the government has not yet made public the reports of the two commissions. The commission under Prasrit took three months to visit all of the then five development regions of the country and take suggestions. At that time, suggestions of 700 people and the family of martyrs were taken into account. But that report is still not publicized. The commission at that time submitted the report to the government saying that only those killed by the state should be recognized as martyrs for the best interest of the country and the people. It also mentioned that the definition of martyrdom should be defined on this basis as this practice is also prevalent in the international arena. At that time, the report was not made public due to the opposition from the then Maoist leaders. In the coming days, the government is set to expand the list of martyrs through an official notice in the Nepal Gazette. A commission will be established to incorporate the newly identified martyrs, adding a total of 2,600 individuals, including those who lost their lives in various accidents. Once the notice is published in the Nepal Gazette, the total count of martyrs in Nepal will rise to 14,797. A cabinet meeting held last Tuesday decided to declare additional martyrs. The Government of Nepal aims to rectify the details of individuals previously declared as martyrs on different dates. It will publish the names of the martyrs exempted from publication in the Nepal Gazette and officially announce the inclusion of the newly identified 2,600 martyrs. As of now, the government has officially recognized and listed 12,197 individuals as martyrs. This count encompasses the period from 1991/92 to 2022/23, during which the government made announcements acknowledging these individuals as martyrs. The decision to declare someone a martyr is processed through the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers on June 4, 2006 acknowledged 21 individuals who lost their lives during the mass movement of April 2006 as martyrs. Additionally, the list of martyrs includes 2,894 individuals from various sectors such as the police, army, armed forces, civil servants, and the National Investigation Department, all of whom lost their lives during the Maoist conflict. The list includes 6,946 individuals associated with the Maoist group and 1,626 civilians, totaling 8,572 people, who were officially declared as martyrs. In subsequent negotiations, the government extended the recognition of martyrdom to those who lost their lives during the Terai Madhesh movement and individuals who died in the course of various other movements.",0,0_dahal_nc_kathmandu_president,"['dahal', 'nc', 'kathmandu', 'president', 'chairman', 'said', 'congress', 'uml', 'office', 'secretary']","['PM Dahal reshuffles his cabinet following new alliance with UML Inducts eight ministers from UML, five from Maoist Center, four from RSP and two from Unified Socialist; KATHMANDU, March 6: Newly-appointed ministers from CPN (Maoist Center), CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special function held at the Office of President on Wednesday.

KATHMANDU, Jan 18: Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha has emphasized that hydroelectricity is the major means for reducing trade deficit and taking the country ahead towards prosperity, and the government has kept it in main priority. Addressing a program organized on the occasion of the 24th anniversary of the Independent Power Producers' Association, Nepal (IPPAN) on Thursday, DPM Shrestha said the country's energy sector can take a leap only through a meaningful initiative of the government and the private sector. DPM Shrestha stressed the need for increasing the consumption of energy within the country, stating that the government is effortful at reducing the trade deficit by selling the surplus power. Reiterating that the government is committed to creating an environment conducive for investment in the energy sector, he said the present government is active in realizing the desire of the Nepali people for economic prosperity. ""Economic prosperity, social justice and good governance are the main priorities of the government,"" he said. Stating that an Investment Summit is being held in coming April, DPM Shrestha maintained the bodies concerned would be consulted for legal and structural improvements for bringing foreign investment in the energy sector. According to him, although an agreement has been made to export 10,000 megawatts of electricity to India in 10 years, increasing domestic consumption of power is the major priority for the government. Minister for Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, Shakti Bahadur Basnet, said the private sector has a contribution of 60 percent to the energy sector of the country and the national motto of building a prosperous Nepal would be fulfilled only through a partnership between the government and the private sector. He reiterated that the government is committed to addressing the demands put forth by the private sector and it has moved ahead respecting the appropriate ones. The Energy Minister presented the data that show energy production has increased from 800 megawatts to 3,000 megawatts over the last decade and electricity has reached 98 percent of households of the country. He called for thinking in a new way from today for bridging the gap in energy production during the monsoon and the dry season, stressing the creation of an environment for speeding up the under-construction projects, prioritizing reservoir-based projects and moving ahead with the concept of energy mix. Minister Basnet maintained that the government has not seen the energy sector only as infrastructure, but also accepted it as the main basis for economic prosperity, urging the private sector to put in investment without any qualms. ""I draw your attention, why could not the works be carried out in a notable way even for more than 10 years after taking the production license? I call upon IPPAN for taking up responsible initiatives on this,"" he said, urging the private sector to fulfill its responsibility. The energy minister assured the private sector not to worry much about the power purchase agreement issue, saying, ""You come forward with a certain amount of work. Come forward completing the works that need to be done from your side. The Ministry shall facilitate in creating a conducive environment for that. The government is ready to address the demands of the private sector."" IPPAN President Ganesh Karki said the country's energy sector is moving forward on a progress trajectory and urged the government to address the demands related to power purchase agreement and the like. He also drew the government’s attention to the security challenges in the energy sector.

Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.41994031927270103,False

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

KATHMANDU, Jan 2: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has requested CPN (Unified Socialist) to recall Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Prakash Jwala from the Council of Ministers. The prime minister personally requested CPN (Unified Socialist) Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal to recall the minister on behalf of the party after he courted controversy during the Balkumari incident last week. Sources said that Prime Minister Dahal urged Chairman Nepal to recall Minister Prakash Jwala as he was found to be responsible for the deaths of two people at the EPS office in Balkumari, Lalitpur, on December 29. ""It would be better to recall the Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport because he was dragged into a controversy,"" the source said, quoting Prime Minister Dahal's appeal to Nepal. Some of the 28,000 youths who failed the ship-building test in the South Korea Employment Permit System (EPS) were protesting near the EPS branch office in Gwarko last Friday when Minister Jwala was traveling through the route in his official vehicle. As the mob tried to manhandle Minister Jwala, security personnel reportedly killed two people in an attempt to protect the minister. The enraged youths then burnt the minister’s vehicle. Hundreds of youths had been protesting outside the branch since Thursday. The security personnel have said that the two people died because of the minister. On Monday, Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Inspector General of Police Basanta Kunwar told the Parliament's State Affairs and Good Governance Committee that the protest erupted due to the negligence of the Ministry of Labor while that the Physical Infrastructure Minister was responsible for the death of the two people.

The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties.

The emerging coalition is anticipated to involve the Maoist Center, CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot.

Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position. It is anticipated that the NC will convene a separate meeting to decide its stance before the alliance meeting on Monday."", 'PM Dahal prepares to seek vote of confidence by March 13 KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.6823549042385879,False
"DPM Shrestha stresses on legal and institutional arrangements to curb financial crimes KATHMANDU, Jan 22: Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha has pointed out the need of making legal and institutional arrangements to curb financial crimes. KATHMANDU, Jan 22: Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha has pointed out the need of making legal and institutional arrangements to curb financial crimes. Addressing the Crime Investigation Review Seminar organized at National Police Academy, Maharajgunj, on Monday, DPM Shrestha mentioned that necessary legal and institutional arrangements would be made as well as technical and capable human resources developed for the investigation of financial crimes. ""Information has been received that the dealing of billions of rupees is being done through crypto. The government has considered it illegal. Transaction of foreign currencies is being done in a new way.

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.8794445589603834,False

KATHMANDU, Jan 28: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and the Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha discussed the internal dispute between the two bodies under the Ministry of Home Affairs at Tribhuvan International Airport. During the discussion, the matter of recalling Gogan Bahadur Hamal, head of the TIA Immigration Office and DIG Arjun Chand, chief of Airport Security, was discussed. However, a decision has not yet been taken in this regard, according to sources at the Ministry of Home Affairs. Prime Minister Dahal had a discussion with the Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Shrestha after the employees working in two agencies forgot their responsibilities in a very sensitive area like the airport. The discussion took place between them at the Prime Minister's Residence in Baluwatar at 9 AM on Saturday. Civil servants complained to Prime Minister Dahal about the incident at the airport. Similarly, Chief Secretary Dr Baikuntha Aryal expressed concerns to the prime minister regarding recent incidents involving police actions at the airport. He pointed out that while standard protocol for addressing issues with personally assigned staff typically involves barring them from entering the airport or reprimanding them at their department, the current approach has escalated to police teams physically assaulting staff members. Dr Aryal emphasized that these aggressive actions by the police are causing significant challenges at the administrative level. While the civil servants complained that the recent activities of the police were making their work difficult, Chief Secretary Aryal and other secretaries complained that the fight between the police and the staff at the TIA had also affected the image of the country. Earlier, on Friday, Gogan Hamal, the head of the TIA Immigration Office, was assaulted by a policeman stationed at the airport. The policemen allegedly manhandled Hamal when he raised questions about the manhandling of an immigration officer, Chhaya Lal Moktan. The government has formed a three-member committee, coordinated by Joint-Secretary Thaneshwor Gautam to probe the incident. The team comprising Nepal Police's Deputy Inspector General Rajeshnath Bastola and Immigration Administration's Under-Secretary Kul Bahadur GC is mandated to submit a report within three days with recommendations.",0,0_dahal_nc_kathmandu_president,"['dahal', 'nc', 'kathmandu', 'president', 'chairman', 'said', 'congress', 'uml', 'office', 'secretary']","['PM Dahal reshuffles his cabinet following new alliance with UML Inducts eight ministers from UML, five from Maoist Center, four from RSP and two from Unified Socialist; KATHMANDU, March 6: Newly-appointed ministers from CPN (Maoist Center), CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special function held at the Office of President on Wednesday.

A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties.

Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot.

Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position. It is anticipated that the NC will convene a separate meeting to decide its stance before the alliance meeting on Monday."", 'PM Dahal prepares to seek vote of confidence by March 13 KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.7264103515685733,False

The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat's team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously.

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur.

Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,True

Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it.

KATHMANDU, Jan 6: The Delegated Management and Government Assurance Committee under the National Assembly has expressed its concerns over the delegated laws of the Tribhuvan University (TU). During a meeting of the parliamentary committee on Friday, lawmakers underlined the need to address operational and management issues within the university arising from rules and by-laws that violate the jurisdictions set by the Delegated Legislation Act. The committee recently conducted a preliminary study on the TU Act, 2049 BS (1992), and various delegated legislations formed under this act were found outside its jurisdictions. Committee President Maya Prasad Sharma said during the study it was found that five rules formulated under the Act, and certain by-laws, directives, and working procedures drafted under these rules were outside legal jurisdictions and contradicted the principles of delegated legislation management. President Sharma stressed the need for extensive discussions and efforts to bring about reforms in response to these issues affecting the university. Committee member Yubraj Sharma insisted on the need of policy and institutional reforms to address the TU issues. Committee members raised several concerns, including the need for increased investment in education, proper placement of human resources, updating laws to align with contemporary times, and an increased realization of duties and responsibilities on the part of TU officials. Shyam Raj Ojha, the President of the TU Central Campus Free Students' Union, who was summoned to the meeting, underscored the importance of changing the government's perception towards the university. He called for depoliticizing the university.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,1.0,False

Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties. As Prime Minister Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with Nepali Congress (NC), NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has also expedited his initiative to strengthen the party’s alliance with other parties in the parliament.

Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice.

The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly.

According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13.

""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP).

"PM Oli urges ministries and agencies to strongly raise issue of climate justice in upcoming COP-29 KATHMANDU, Oct 25: Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli instructed the concerned ministries and agencies to eloquently advocate for climate justice in the upcoming COP-29 climate conference. KATHMANDU, Oct 25: Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli instructed the concerned ministries and agencies to eloquently advocate for climate justice in the upcoming COP-29 climate conference. PM Oli directed the relevant ministries and agencies to strongly raise the issues relating to climate justice for vulnerable countries like Nepal as articulated by Nepal in the UN's 79th General Assembly (UNGA). The UN climate conference is taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan from November 11 to 22 this year. The Nepali delegation to the conference is being led by President Ram Chandra Paudel. Addressing the third meeting of the Environment Conservation and Climate Change Management National Council at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers on Friday, PM Oli urged the Nepali delegation to put forward Nepal's clear stance and perspective on climate change and its impact in the upcoming COP-29. PM Oli has been championing the cause of climate justice and advocating for compensation for Nepal from the countries responsible for significant carbon emissions, highlighting the adverse effects of global warming on the Himalayan region and its inhabitants. He has been demanding an action-plan from the global community aimed at maintaining environmental balance from high mountains to the seas. Prime Minister Oli directed all stakeholders to give priority to intensive forest expansion by ending the situation where there is no forest in the designated forest areas. PM Oli clarified that industries will be allowed to operate in places where there are no forests provided that they ensure protecting the environment. The meeting also reviewed the council’s work in the past one year and informed about the status of implementation of the decisions of the previous meetings, the effective participation of Nepal in the World Climate Conference (COP-29) to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan in November 2024, changing the name of the Ministry of Forests and Environment to Forests, Environment and Climate Change.

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

However, some leaders from the ruling coalition of the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML who have also been accused of involvement in cooperative frauds have not been arrested. Referring to this situation, Shrestha demanded equal treatment for all accused of cooperative fraud cases. “We want any anti-corruption action, anti-fraud action to proceed as per the law,” he told the corner meeting, “What we are saying is that such investigations should be clean and fair and should not discriminate on the basis of political inclination.” Shrestha also objected to Prime Minister KP Oli accepting the donation of land from businessman Min Bahadur Gurung for the construction of the ruling UML's party office. Gurung was convicted of involvement in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. “In the case of Lalita Niwas, the case of organized crime is pending,” Shrestha said, “The Prime Minister should not accept a gift from a person who has been found guilty by a special court in one case.”",0,0_dahal_nc_kathmandu_president,"['dahal', 'nc', 'kathmandu', 'president', 'chairman', 'said', 'congress', 'uml', 'office', 'secretary']","['PM Dahal reshuffles his cabinet following new alliance with UML Inducts eight ministers from UML, five from Maoist Center, four from RSP and two from Unified Socialist; KATHMANDU, March 6: Newly-appointed ministers from CPN (Maoist Center), CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special function held at the Office of President on Wednesday.

"Maoist Center hits the streets of Kathmandu with massive protest KATHMANDU, Oct 27: The main opposition party, CPN (Maoist Center), took to the streets of Kathmandu after a long gap with a vigilance rally against the government on Saturday. KATHMANDU, Oct 27: The main opposition party, CPN (Maoist Center), took to the streets of Kathmandu after a long gap with a vigilance rally against the government on Saturday. Thousands of leaders and cadres of the third largest party in the federal parliament assembled from various districts of Bagmati Province at Kathmandu Mall at 11 am on Saturday for the protest. The ‘vigilance rally’ marched through Ratnapark and Bagbazar before converging into a corner meeting at Bhrikutimandap. The Maoist Center organized the vigilance rally demanding the government to promptly address the problems of the recent disaster victims. The party demanded the search for the missing, relief distribution, treatment for the injured, and the construction of temporary shelters, citing the government’s insensitivity, irresponsibility, and lack of planning in disaster management. The party also accused the Oli government of facilitating corrupt activities that weakened the erstwhile Maoist Center-led government’s campaign of good governance. The protest was the first occasion that the party has hit the streets with a protest after it was ousted from the former government four months ago. The rally led by the party’s chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal was attended by most of the top leaders of the party including Senior Vice-Chairman Narayan Kaji Shrestha, vice chairpersons Agni Prasad Sapkota and Pampha Bhusal, General Secretary Dev Gurung, deputy general secretaries Barshaman Pun and Janardan Sharma, along with other officials and leaders of the party. Addressing the corner meeting in Bhrikutimandap, former Prime Minister Dahal claimed that the party will contest the next general election on its own, without seeking electoral alliance with any other parties. “We are adamant of contesting the next election without an electoral alliance with the ruling parties CPN-UML or Nepali Congress,” he said, “We will not seek ministerial portfolio or the position of prime minister in a coalition government.” He also stated that this vigilance rally was not organized as an attempt to topple the government. “We are concerned that the ruling parties have exhibited tendencies of capitalists, brokers, middlemen and corrupt people of this country,” he said, “We are in serious soul-searching for collaborating with them in previous coalitions.” Speaking at the corner meeting, senior vice-chairman of the party Narayan Kaji Shrestha demanded equal treatment for all alleged cooperative frauds, expressing support for the investigations into corruption and fraud by the coalition government.

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power.""

Local representatives submit memorandum to PM Oli to complete the construction works within the deadline KATHMANDU, Nov 15: Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has warned that the contract will be terminated if the work on the Narayanghat-Butwal road expansion is not resumed by mid-December. Prime Minister Oli issued the warning after receiving a memorandum submitted by the elected representatives from the districts along the Narayanghat-Butwal road section. They drew the attention of Prime Minister Oli, citing negligence in the construction work. Representatives from Rupandehi, Nawalparasi West and Nawalparasi East raised the issue during a meeting with PM Oli on Thursday. Prime Minister Oli said that a decision regarding the delay in the road expansion will be reached soon. During the discussion, the prime minister mentioned that if the work does not begin by mid-December, there will be no option but to terminate the contract, according to his secretariat. Prime Minister Oli emphasized that if the contractor company works reliably, it would be appropriate to assign them the task. He further stated that there is a need to avoid the tendency of holding projects without making any progress. Prime Minister Oli said, ""The work we expected to be done with urgency and anticipation has not been achieved. The residents of that area have been suffering in dust and dirt for a long time. It has also impacted economic development activities."" He added, ""This issue needs to be taken seriously, and the concerned authorities must act. I have also paid serious attention to this matter. We have reached a point where we must make decisions."" The government extended the deadline for the contract of this road section three times: first in August 2022, second in July 2023, and third in July 2024. According to the third extension, the work was supposed to be completed by July 23, 2025, but only half of the work has been completed so far. A few days ago, an all-party meeting, which included representatives from political parties in West Nawalparasi, decided to draw the government's attention to the delays in the road expansion. Accordingly, a team of elected representatives visited the prime minister at his residence in Baluwatar on Thursday. According to the elected representatives from the three districts, the Chinese company responsible for the road expansion has delayed the work, causing hardship for passengers, drivers and residents of the settlements along the roadside. The memorandum submitted to the prime minister states, ""Due to the negligence of the concerned contracting company, the condition of the road remains chaotic, causing great inconvenience to travelers and exposing nearby residents to a polluted environment. We urge that the responsible parties be given strict instructions to accelerate the construction work."" The Chinese contractor is responsible for the road expansion, but it has faced criticism for delays in the work. Before Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, a delegation consisting of members of the House of Representatives, Provincial Assembly members, heads of the concerned district coordination committees and municipal mayors from three districts submitted the memorandum. The memorandum was presented to Prime Minister Oli by Bhagauti Yadav Rudal, the chief of the District Coordination Committee of Nawalparasi West, citing negligence in the construction work. He stated that the company responsible for the construction should be given strict instructions to complete the work quickly. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel, Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal, Minister for Land Management and Cooperatives Balram Adhikari and Secretary at the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure Keshab Sharma were also present during the meeting. Minister for Physical Infrastructure Dahal said that despite repeated warnings to the construction company, the work had not started. He, however, said that he had received assurance that the work will begin by the end of December. A contract agreement was made with the China State Construction company on March 22, 2019, to complete the construction of the road section by August 7, 2022. So far, 44 percent of the payment has been made and 52 percent of the work has been completed. The agreement for the expansion of the Narayanghat-Butwal road section was signed with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 113-kilometer-long road expansion project was divided into two sections, with separate contracts awarded for each. The contract for the 64.42-kilometer eastern section, known as Gaindakot-Daunne, and the 48.58-kilometer western section, known as Daunne-Butwal, was signed for a total cost of Rs 16.99 billion. China State Construction was awarded the contract for the Gaindakot-Daunne section at a cost of Rs 9.13 billion and the Daunne-Butwal section at a cost of Rs 7.86 billion.",0,0_dahal_nc_kathmandu_president,"['dahal', 'nc', 'kathmandu', 'president', 'chairman', 'said', 'congress', 'uml', 'office', 'secretary']","['PM Dahal reshuffles his cabinet following new alliance with UML Inducts eight ministers from UML, five from Maoist Center, four from RSP and two from Unified Socialist; KATHMANDU, March 6: Newly-appointed ministers from CPN (Maoist Center), CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special function held at the Office of President on Wednesday.

Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist).

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,1.0,False
"NC, UML reach an understanding not to implement BRI projects through loans According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality.

KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,True
"Ruling parties propose dual role for VP as National Assembly chair Article 92 of the Constitution currently has provisions for the election of the chairperson and vice chairperson of the National Assembly. Preparations are underway to amend this article and eliminate the election system for the chairperson. KATHMANDU, Nov 30: The ruling parties have floated the proposal to designate the vice president as the speaker of the National Assembly through a constitutional amendment. This issue was previously debated during the drafting of the constitution by the Constituent Assembly but was excluded due to disagreements among major political parties. If an attempt is made to amend the constitution to make the vice president the chairperson of the National Assembly, it appears that all parties are likely to agree. This amendment is being viewed positively as it would help reduce the financial burden on the state. Article 92 of the Constitution currently has provisions for the election of the chairperson and vice chairperson of the National Assembly. Preparations are underway to amend this article and eliminate the election system for the chairperson. Efforts are being made to include a provision in Article 67 of the Constitution that assigns the role of the chairperson of the National Assembly to the vice president. Preparations are underway to amend the constitution to add this responsibility to the vice president’s duties, while retaining the existing provision that allows the vice president to perform the duties of the president in the latter's absence. Similarly, arrangements are being planned to provide the vice president with two offices. The vice president will operate from the National Assembly when performing duties there and from the vice president's office when not engaged in the upper house work. Several countries with parliamentary systems have also adopted similar provisions, allowing the vice president to maintain dual offices. It is common for the vice president to have an office in the Parliament when presiding over the upper house and a separate office outside the Parliament for their duties as vice president. In neighboring India, the vice president also serves as the presiding officer of the upper house, the Rajya Sabha. A dedicated office is provided for the vice president to carry out responsibilities outside the Parliament. The ruling coalition of the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML is preparing to introduce a constitutional amendment bill in the upcoming winter session of Parliament. A legal expert has stated that if the constitution is amended by a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament to designate the vice president as the chairperson of the National Assembly, the current chairperson, Narayan Prasad Dahal, will be relieved of his position effective from the date the amendment. Narayan Prasad Dahal's position as a Member of Parliament will remain unaffected. Dahal was nominated as a National Assembly member on April 8, 2022, and his term as an MP will continue until March 3, 2028. Commenting on the matter, Ram Narayan Bidari, a former National Assembly member affiliated with the Maoist Center, said, ""When amending the constitution, there will be theoretical and practical discussions. The focus will not be on who will lose their post and who will not. There is no reason for the Maoist Party to oppose the proposal of assigning the vice president the additional responsibility of the chairperson of the National Assembly."" If the constitution is amended in the winter session of Parliament to make the vice president the chairperson of the National Assembly, it would be a practical disadvantage for the Maoist Center but a benefit for the Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal. Currently, Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav, an MP from the Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal, holds the position of vice president. At a program in the capital a week ago, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba said that the constitution would be amended to include a provision making the vice president also the chairperson of the National Assembly.

Madhav Kumar Nepal-led Unified Socialist has sent Dhan Bahadur Budha (Urban Development) and Bhanu Bhakta Jaisi (Federal Affairs and General Administration) as ministers in the Dahal-led Cabinet. In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties. As Prime Minister Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with Nepali Congress (NC), NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has also expedited his initiative to strengthen the party’s alliance with other parties in the parliament.

Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot.

However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold.

In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.8598822327396981,False
"Deuba's successor unclear as NC leaders jostle for presidency; Bhandari set to challenge Oli in UML Leadership Race within NC and UML KATHMANDU, Nov 8: As some political parties gear up for the next federal election, scheduled three years from now, second-rung leaders from the two major parties—Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML—are already maneuvering to secure top positions within their respective parties. Within the NC, the largest party in the federal parliament, second-tier leaders are intensifying efforts to position themselves as contenders for the party presidency, while CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli now faces a new rival as former president Bidya Devi Bhandari eyes the top leadership of the party in the upcoming general convention. Dr Koirala, Thapa set to split as Deuba weighs support within his camp NC leader Dr Shekhar Koirala, who finished as the runner-up in the presidential race during the 14th General Convention of the NC in December 2021, has been working tirelessly to become the party’s top leader since his defeat. A group of youth leaders within the NC has recently ramped up efforts to garner support for him, as Koirala continues to build momentum among party leaders and cadres. General Secretary Gagan Thapa, who ran as Koirala's running mate in the 14th General Convention, is also a contender for the top leadership from the rival faction. Insiders say Thapa is quietly working to strengthen his support base ahead of the upcoming general convention. According to the NC statute, current President Sher Bahadur Deuba will be ineligible to run for the presidency again, as he will have completed two terms by the next general convention in 2026. There is still no clarity regarding who will receive President Deuba’s backing. Former General Secretary Dr Shashank Koirala has publicly stated that Deuba has promised him his support in the 15th General Convention. Meanwhile, other aspirants for the presidency include former vice president Purna Bahadur Khadka, Bimalendra Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, and Prakash Man Singh. Each of these leaders seeks Deuba's support for their presidential bids. However, Deuba is yet to make any commitments, according to insiders. ""President Deuba wants to secure a position for his wife, Dr Arzu Deuba, within the party. Anyone willing to pledge the top office-bearer’s post to her is likely to win his support. All the potential candidates from the establishment faction are ready to do so if they secure Deuba’s backing,"" claimed a senior NC leader from the faction. Oli faces new rival as former prez Bhandari eyes leadership In the UML, the second-largest party, Prime Minister and Chairman KP Oli has indicated his intention to run for chairmanship again in the upcoming general convention. However, his goal of securing unanimous re-election seems unlikely, as former president Bidya Devi Bhandari is preparing to challenge him. Bhandari, who carries the legacy of one of the party’s influential leaders, the late Madan Bhandari, who propounded the idea of ‘People’s Multiparty Democracy’, has renewed her UML membership and stepped up meetings with second-rung UML leaders. The party is expected to hold its general convention in the next two years. The two-time president, Bhandari, had resigned from her UML affiliation when she was first elected as the head of state. Oli, who helped elect Bhandari as president for two consecutive terms, has publicly expressed dissatisfaction with her return to active party politics, viewing her as a potential rival. Several senior UML leaders, including Bishnu Paudel, Prithvi Subba Gurung, Gokul Banskota, Bhim Rawal, Yogesh Bhattarai, and Surendra Pandey—many of whom are disillusioned with Oli—are reportedly in talks with Bhandari. Sources claim Bhandari has also been meeting with leaders of other leftist parties, such as CPN (Unified Socialist) leader Madhav Kumar Nepal and CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal. UML insiders suggest that Bhandari hopes to unite all leftist parties under a single banner. ""Former president Bhandari aims to become the executive chairperson of a unified communist party.

Those appointed as ministers from Maoist Center include Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister), Barsha Man Pun (Finance Minister), Shakti Bahadur Basnet (Energy), Rekha Sharma (Information and Communication) and Hit Bahadur Tamang (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation). Shrestha, Sharma and Basnet served as ministers from the Maoist Center in the previous Dahal-led Cabinet with Nepali Congress. Similarly, Prime Minister Dahal has appointed UML leaders Raghu Bir Mahaseth (Deputy Prime Minister and Physical Infrastructure), Padam Giri (Law), Jwala Kumari Shah (Agriculture), Damodar Bhandari (Industry), Rajendra Rai (Drinking Water), Hari Upreti (Defense), Bhagawati Chaudhary (Women and Children) and Bal Ram Adhikari (Land Reform Management) as his Cabinet colleagues. Similarly, four RSP leaders including Rabi Lamichhane (Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister), DP Aryal (Labor, Employment and Social Security), Sumana Shrestha (Education) and Biraj Bhakta Shrestha (Youths and Sports) have been inducted in the Dahal-led Cabinet. Madhav Kumar Nepal-led Unified Socialist has sent Dhan Bahadur Budha (Urban Development) and Bhanu Bhakta Jaisi (Federal Affairs and General Administration) as ministers in the Dahal-led Cabinet. In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties. As Prime Minister Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with Nepali Congress (NC), NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has also expedited his initiative to strengthen the party’s alliance with other parties in the parliament.

Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP).

"NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president.

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur.

The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede.

During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes.

Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,True
"Maoist Strategy: 'Pun Card' as a catalyst for Bhandari’s return to politics Chairman KP Oli had hinted that Bhandari could actively contribute within the party during the party's foundation day and another public program organized in Godavari, Lalitpur, on April 21. KATHMANDU, Dec 23: It is speculated that former President Bidya Bhandari and former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun are becoming active in party politics. While rumors suggest that Bhandari, who served two terms as President from the CPN-UML, will return to politics, the Maoist Center has already begun preparations to nominate former Vice President Pun as its candidate for Vice President. By involving Pun in party politics, the Maoist Center is paving the way to promote former President Bhandari in UML politics in a manner that will make her active. ""By making Pun active in politics, the Maoists are creating an environment for Bidya Bhandari to enter politics again,"" said a UML vice chairman. The Maoist office bearers' meeting has already decided to make Pun the vice chairman. To this end, the meeting formed a task force, led by Senior Vice Chairman Narayan Kaji Shrestha, General Secretary Dev Prasad Gurung, and Deputy General Secretaries Barsaman Pun and Janardan Sharma, to amend the statute. Maoist leaders claim that Pun will be nominated as the vice-chairman once the revised statute is passed in the upcoming central committee meeting. Few days ago, on December 15, Prime Minister and UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli urged party members not to involve the former president too much in politics. He said that since the party itself had made Bhandari the president, there was no need to keep raising the issue, suggesting she could join the party if necessary. However, Bhandari herself has not publicly stated whether or not she plans to reenter politics. “After she showed interest in being active in politics, a debate has started within the UML ranks about her role and how to manage it effectively. The discussion is focused solely on how to make her active in the party,"" said the vice-chairman. According to him, it would be easier for the UML if the Maoists make Pun the vice-chairman. ""The Maoists and other small left-wing parties are also discussing unification with the UML by making Pun the vice-chairman, which is an emotional move to bring Bhandari back to the UML,"" the vice-chairman added. UML Standing Committee member Karna Thapa opined that politics is determined by necessity, and the party ranks would consider former President Bhandari becoming active in politics if deemed necessary. He said that this could only happen in the absence of the current Chairman and Prime Minister Oli, or with his consent. ""She (former President Bhandari) can also become active. This is a matter of her wish. Necessity determines it. This is what the Chairman intends,"" Thapa said. According to him, the larger ranks of UML want to see the former President become active in the party. ""A large number of UML cadres are urging the former president to become active in the party, but she has not responded yet. Since she is a cadre who should not be active, and given the party's needs, it is not appropriate to say that this is the case right now,"" said Standing Committee member Thapa. Chairman KP Oli had hinted that Bhandari could actively contribute within the party during the party's foundation day and another public program organized in Godavari, Lalitpur, on April 21. At the same event, the party honored her with the 'Republican Pride' award. The party's stance on this honor was interpreted in two ways. Some viewed the honor of Republican Pride as an unannounced ban on former President Bhandari from entering party politics, while others saw it as an opening for her to become active in politics by allowing her to participate in party programs. Since then, former President Bhandari has participated in several special programs of the party. She was the chief guest at a UML women's gathering on May 28. UML Chairman Oli participated in the gathering as a special speaker. It was likely the first event where Oli had to be a special guest at a UML function after being elected as chairman. The gathering was organized by the UML Mass Organization Coordination Mechanism. Under his leadership, a special resolution regarding 33 percent women's participation was passed by parliament, and rights were ensured in the interim constitution. The UML is now promoting this as part of its agenda. The activism seen in former President Bhandari's political and social programs can be interpreted as a sign of her return to active politics. In addition, the frequent visits and dialogues of a majority of office bearers, including some women leaders, at the residence of Senior Vice President Ishwor Pokharel, along with the continuous meetings of district-level leadership, are motivating Bhandari. After Chairman Oli, there are efforts to make her active in the party committee, highlighting that transferring leadership unanimously in the second generation is not easy, apart from electoral competition. UML leaders also claim that some leaders are trying to spark her interest in politics, believing she could unite the divided Unified Socialist Party. Although former President Bhandari has not made an official statement on the matter, she has begun to express her interest in becoming active in politics, with many in the party ranks wanting to see her do so. UML Standing Committee member Thapa has stated that there is a possibility that former President Bhandari could become the party president at the 11th General Convention, or even before that, adding that the current party president may also agree to this. ""If the 11th General Convention is to be a consensus convention, discussions on leadership can gradually take place with the president’s consent. But if he himself says there is no need to worry about this issue, then a solution will be found,"" Thapa said. Responding to questions from participants at the Youth Conclave-2024 ceremony held on August 24, Prime Minister Oli announced that a woman can be made prime minister. He emphasized that he had appointed a woman as president, speaker, chief justice, defense minister, and chief secretary during his tenure. Bhandari, who was elected as the first female president of Nepal on October 28 after the constitution was promulgated on September 20, 2015, served two years and four months in her previous term. After the 2074 BS elections, the UML nominated Bhandari as its candidate for the final term on behalf of the Left Alliance, and she completed her five-year term as the elected President from March 13, 2018 to March 12, 2023. After leaving the presidency, she invited some media persons and party workers to her residence for a light discussion on political interests. Moreover, after she left the President’s Office, the Madan Bhandari Foundation was activated to celebrate Madan Bhandari's birth anniversary on June 29, 2023. The foundation had been active before, celebrating Madan Bhandari's birth and memorial day, but this time the event was made a bit more special. Former President Bhandari was the chief guest at the program organized by the Madan Bhandari Foundation at the National Assembly on the occasion of Madan Bhandari's 72nd birth anniversary. In the program, where the patron of the foundation, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, was the special guest, former President Bhandari not only discussed Madan Bhandari's contributions but also delivered a political message. ""Despite the changes in the political structure of the country, the task of the Nepali revolution has not been completed,"" she said. After becoming president on October 28, 2015, Bhandari withdrew from political programs. Following the end of her second term on March 12, 2023, Bhandari participated publicly under the banner of the foundation for the first time. She did not hold any formal position in the foundation. Former President Bhandari had mobilized 11 mass organizations of the UML to celebrate Madan Jayanti. She had organized meetings with officials from various organizations, including All Nepal National Free Students Union (UML), the National Federation of Youth, the Akhil Nepali Mahila Sangh (ANEM), the Nepal Confederation of Sports, Press Chautari, and other mass organizations. Because of this, there are occasional indications that she may want to re-enter politics.",0,0_dahal_nc_kathmandu_president,"['dahal', 'nc', 'kathmandu', 'president', 'chairman', 'said', 'congress', 'uml', 'office', 'secretary']","['PM Dahal reshuffles his cabinet following new alliance with UML Inducts eight ministers from UML, five from Maoist Center, four from RSP and two from Unified Socialist; KATHMANDU, March 6: Newly-appointed ministers from CPN (Maoist Center), CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special function held at the Office of President on Wednesday. The new Cabinet has 20 ministers including three Deputy Prime Ministers, one each from Maoist Center, UML and RSP. The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from Rastriya Swatantra Party and two from Unified Socialist. Those appointed as ministers from Maoist Center include Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister), Barsha Man Pun (Finance Minister), Shakti Bahadur Basnet (Energy), Rekha Sharma (Information and Communication) and Hit Bahadur Tamang (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation). Shrestha, Sharma and Basnet served as ministers from the Maoist Center in the previous Dahal-led Cabinet with Nepali Congress. Similarly, Prime Minister Dahal has appointed UML leaders Raghu Bir Mahaseth (Deputy Prime Minister and Physical Infrastructure), Padam Giri (Law), Jwala Kumari Shah (Agriculture), Damodar Bhandari (Industry), Rajendra Rai (Drinking Water), Hari Upreti (Defense), Bhagawati Chaudhary (Women and Children) and Bal Ram Adhikari (Land Reform Management) as his Cabinet colleagues. Similarly, four RSP leaders including Rabi Lamichhane (Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister), DP Aryal (Labor, Employment and Social Security), Sumana Shrestha (Education) and Biraj Bhakta Shrestha (Youths and Sports) have been inducted in the Dahal-led Cabinet. Madhav Kumar Nepal-led Unified Socialist has sent Dhan Bahadur Budha (Urban Development) and Bhanu Bhakta Jaisi (Federal Affairs and General Administration) as ministers in the Dahal-led Cabinet. In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties. As Prime Minister Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with Nepali Congress (NC), NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has also expedited his initiative to strengthen the party’s alliance with other parties in the parliament. While he held a meeting with Unified Socialist Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal at the latter;s residence, he held separate meetings with various Madhesh-based political parties at his own residence in Baluwatar on Wednesday evening.', ""PM Dahal solicits UML support for new alliance amidst deepening mistrust with NC KATHMANDU, March 3: As mistrust and tensions deepen between ruling Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the likelihood of a new political alliance is rapidly gaining traction.

KATHMANDU, March 3: As mistrust and tensions deepen between ruling Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the likelihood of a new political alliance is rapidly gaining traction. The emerging coalition is anticipated to involve the Maoist Center, CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position. It is anticipated that the NC will convene a separate meeting to decide its stance before the alliance meeting on Monday."", 'PM Dahal prepares to seek vote of confidence by March 13 KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.8195372155768486,False
"PM Oli calls for global unity to address climate change challenge Addressing the review program of the 29th World Climate Conference organized by the Ministry of Forests and Environment on Thursday, PM Oli emphasized that even those countries in disagreement on other issues must unite and work together to keep the air and nature clean. KATHMANDU, Dec 26: Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has said that all institutions and individuals at the national and international levels should unite to resolve the challenge of climate change. Addressing the review program of the 29th World Climate Conference organized by the Ministry of Forests and Environment on Thursday, PM Oli emphasized that even those countries in disagreement on other issues must unite and work together to keep the air and nature clean. Stating that the government will provide climate finance along with the leadership of the work to face the challenge of climate change, he emphasized that the Ministry of Forests and Environment and the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology should spread awareness to prevent forest fires as the land becomes dry that will adversely affect the agricultural sector, and every community should be alert to prevent human-induced environmental pollution. “We have not contributed to global warming but have been forced to bear the effects of it. We are being punished for something we did not cause. Nepal being affected is not just our issue as it is a global matter,” PM Oli said, “The issue of the Himalayan climate is not just about the Himalayas. The warming system of the world is connected to the Himalayas.” Reminding that Nepal should be given climate compensation in the 79th General Assembly of the United Nations, PM Oli said that Nepal has protected 17 percent of the earth’s land to protect its environment. PM Oli also emphasized to start preparations for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP 30) from now along with the review of COP 29. The 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was held in Baku, Azerbaijan from November 11–22, 2024. The participation of Nepal in the conference and the steps Nepal should take in the field of climate change in the coming days were reviewed. The Nepali delegation, led by President Ram Chandra Paudel, had participated in the conference.

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede.

During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes.

Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False
"Maoists cast an ‘evil eye’ on Shera Durbar during Dahal's tenure as PM It has been revealed that 184 ropanis of land belonging to Shera Durbar in Bidur, Nuwakot, was transferred to Bikesh Shrestha, who worked in the personal secretariat of the then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center). KATHMANDU, Dec 27: It has been revealed that 184 ropanis of land belonging to Shera Durbar in Bidur, Nuwakot, was transferred to Bikesh Shrestha, who worked in the personal secretariat of the then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center). The transfer of shares to Annapurna Farming in Shrestha's name occurred under the order of the then land reform secretary Mohan Krishna Sapkota, who approved the share transfer deal. On July 24, 2016, Maoist Chairman Dahal assumed the position of Prime Minister for a second time. During his tenure, Mohan Krishna Sapkota served as the Secretary of the Ministry of Land Reform. Secretary Sapkota had affiliations with the Maoists. Sapkota assumed the position of Secretary of the Ministry of Land Reform on December 7, 2015. After Dahal became the Prime Minister, Bikesh Shrestha joined Annapurna Farming. The Company Registrar's Office documents reveal that he invested Rs 56.75 million at that time. ""Then Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal directed Land Reform Secretary Mohan Krishna Sapkota to allocate land in the name of Bikesh Shrestha,"" said an official from the Ministry of Land Reform. After Republica covered the matter, former PM Dahal's Personal Secretary Ramesh Malla clarified that the individuals mentioned in the news are no longer involved in any party responsibilities or contacts. ""We want to clarify that the person mentioned in the news has not held any role in our party for a long time,"" said Malla, Dahal's personal secretary. ""We have taken serious note of the news titled Maoists behind the encroachment of Shera Durbar in Nuwakot, which links the leadership of our party, known for upholding good governance. Such propaganda, made without factual investigation, not only questions the credibility of the news but also exposes its malicious intent."" Malla has urged the concerned authorities to investigate the matter related to the palace and bring any involved individuals under the scope of punishment. However, when the Maoist Chairman became Prime Minister for the third time, the authorities halted the investigation into a complaint filed with the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police. At that time, Kiran Bajracharya headed the CIB, and Narayan Kaji Shrestha served as the home minister. ""Although the home minister tried to advance the investigation, the prime minister stopped it,"" said a source. The source links the Dahal family directly to the land in question. It claims that their relatives have also invested in the land. Maoist leaders and activists from Nuwakot state that the late Sita Dahal, Dahal's wife, used to occasionally visit the area and showed interest in the land there. ""Occasionally, Sita Dahal visited. Our friends in Nuwakot raised a pheasant, which she took with her. She also took the pheasant coop, and they even built a house for her to stay in,"" claimed a Maoist activist. After Shrestha took the shares in 2016, he built both temporary and permanent structures there. The source claims that they even built a house for Dahal's wife. She visited the area frequently until 2017. However, after the death of Dahal's son, Prakash Dahal, during the 2017 elections, and due to her illness, Sita Dahal couldn't visit. ""She (Sita Dahal) couldn't come after falling ill. Since then, some land has been sold to people from Kathmandu,"" said a local Maoist leader from Nuwakot. The farming company, leased for 12 years, has only three plots of residential land. The title deed of the landowner, Shrestha, lists five plots as government land, three plots for a pond, one plot for bananas, and one plot as a garden. Although land with a pond, bananas, and a garden would typically be considered government land, authorities have found that the farming company surveyed these lands under its name. Helen Shah sold 20 ropanis of the land, famously known as the Queen's Palace area, to Rajani Shrestha and Barsha Basnet (Chitrakar) from Battar. The land, with plot numbers 79, 80, and 81 (plot 81 was split and is now listed as plot numbers 1752 and 1753), was sold by Shah. The landowners sold nine annas of land from plot number 81 to Basanta Bahadur Basnet, the brother of Barsha Basnet, a resident of Narjamandap in Tadi Municipality, now living in Kathmandu, for Rs 500,000 on January 29, 2024. After dividing plot number 81, they surveyed the remaining 6 ropanis of land under the joint name of Rajani Shrestha and Barsha Basnet (Chitrakar) with plot number 1753. Developers have constructed both permanent and temporary structures on over 184 ropanis of land, exceeding the boundary of the historic Shera Durbar in Nuwakot. Although they built these structures under the name of Annapurna Farming, no agricultural activities or farming have taken place on the land. After noticing the excess land, they transferred it to the company's name and planned to sell it. Investigators have found that a company was established for agricultural purposes, and individuals transferred the land to the company's name. ""Around 2013 or the surrounding years, individuals including Bikesh Shrestha purchased Annapurna Pvt Ltd, and since then, they have acted as the land custodians here,"" the source said. However, on paper, Shrestha appears to have joined Annapurna Farming as a shareholder only in 2017. Local residents speculate that Shrestha is the husband of Sita Dahal's maternal cousin (her brother-in-law by relation). However, no sources have confirmed this. Shrestha held the position of personal secretary when Dahal was Prime Minister in 2008, and after purchasing the company, local residents mention that Sita Dahal visited Shera Durbar three to four times between 2017 and 2018. Local residents said that after Sita Dahal expressed interest in the land and location, Bikesh Shrestha built a three-story, well-equipped house at her request. However, as Sita Dahal's health declined, she could not stay there, and since the completion of the construction, the house has remained unused. On this matter, Nuwakot MP Hit Bahadur Tamang defended the leadership in a social media post. He also called for an investigation into the facts. Claiming to be from Nuwakot, he stated that if any Maoist had occupied land, authorities would take action. He further refuted the news, asserting that it falsely accused the Maoist leadership. Bikesh Shrestha became a shareholder of Annapurna Farming in 2017 and later took full ownership. In some cases, he took possession of the land by plotting it. Although the land was transferred under the name of the farming company, he left it unused. After becoming a central member of the Maoist party, he started plotting the land, using his influence and connections. The Land Reform Ministry's Land Revenue Office in Nuwakot has been alarmed by the issue of land plotting. ""We have already filed a complaint with the government authorities regarding the land plotting,"" said a local from Bidur Municipality-2 in Nuwakot. He added that out of 184 ropanis, 161 ropanis of land is registered in the name of Annapurna Farming. On February 25, 1979, the Nuwakot Survey Office surveyed and registered the land related to Shera Durbar, including plots number 82, 83, 84, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 97, and 98, covering an area of 164-13-02-01 ropanis, under the name of Gaurishankar Farming. After the enactment of the Land Reform Act, boundary restrictions placed the land related to Shera Durbar and its associated plots under the ownership of Helen Shah, the wife of the late Prince Basundhara, and Bijaya Rajya Laxmi Shah. Since the land could not be surveyed in individual names due to boundary issues, the authorities surveyed it under the name of Gaurishankar Farming. Although the survey of Shera Durbar's land was conducted under the name of Gaurishankar Farming, Helen Shah and Bijaya Rajya Laxmi Shah were the directors and shareholders. Gaurishankar Farming was established on March 12, 1971, and it seems to have transformed into Annapurna Farming through a decision made on June 15, 1979. On June 25, 1987, the Land Revenue Office records replaced Gaurishankar with Annapurna Farming. By 1995, the company shares, originally held by Bijaya Rajya Laxmi Shah, were transferred to Jayanti Shah. In 1995, four individuals - Narendra Lal Pradhan, Kedar Nath Shrestha, Sajani Shrestha, and Sohini Shrestha - received all the shares previously held by Helen Shah and Jayanti Shah. Then, in June 2016, a decision to cancel three share registrations revealed that Bikesh Shrestha purchased shares worth Rs 56.75 million, totaling 567,500 shares. Similarly, Ajay Kumar Suryavanshi also holds shares. He bought 460,410 shares, valued at Rs 46.41million. Likewise, Dhruba Lal Shrestha, a resident of Bidur Municipality-4 in Nuwakot, bought 45,000 shares valued at Rs 4.5 million. Suman Parik, a resident of Nagarjun Municipality-7 in Kathmandu, bought 45,000 shares valued at Rs 4.5 million and shares worth Rs 111.79 million were transferred to the name of the company. As of November 26, 2023, Bikesh Shrestha and Ajay Kumar Suryabanshi remain as shareholders, and Bikesh Shrestha’s son Manobal Shrestha, became a new shareholder with 90,000 shares valued at Rs 9 million. Currently, only three shareholders remain, with Bikesh and Manobal Shrestha being father and son.",0,0_dahal_nc_kathmandu_president,"['dahal', 'nc', 'kathmandu', 'president', 'chairman', 'said', 'congress', 'uml', 'office', 'secretary']","['PM Dahal reshuffles his cabinet following new alliance with UML Inducts eight ministers from UML, five from Maoist Center, four from RSP and two from Unified Socialist; KATHMANDU, March 6: Newly-appointed ministers from CPN (Maoist Center), CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special function held at the Office of President on Wednesday.

"Ship (Operation and Management) Bill 2081 BS submitted to parliament The government has prepared a bill to regulate the operation of ships, ‘Ship (Operation and Management) Bill 2081 BS’, and it has been submitted to parliament for consideration. This bill aims to establish a legal framework for the safe and systematic operation of ships in Nepal. KATHMANDU, Dec 29: The government has prepared a bill to regulate the operation of ships, ‘Ship (Operation and Management) Bill 2081 BS’, and it has been submitted to parliament for consideration. This bill aims to establish a legal framework for the safe and systematic operation of ships in Nepal. Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Devendra Dahal, has registered the bill related to ship operation in the National Assembly. According to him, the bill aims to create a legal framework to develop and expand ship operations. He explained the reason for introducing the bill, stating, ""Effective regulation is needed to make ship services safe, high-quality, reliable, regular, and well-organized."" Once the proposed bill is enacted, it will establish regulations for determining waterway routes, permissions, and usage. It will also cover provisions related to the construction of ships, operation of water transport services, surveys, registrations, and the issuance of certificates for vessels. The bill also aims to establish provisions for granting national certification to commercial ships, using Nepal’s flag on ships, transferring ownership and mortgage rights, and issuing certificates related to tonnage and safety standards. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport (MoPIT) has highlighted these key aspects in the proposed legislation. Once the bill is enacted, it will outline the conditions for operating ships, including pollution control, waste management, maintenance, accident investigations, search and rescue operations, and the responsibilities and powers of the watercraft office and registrar. The MoPIT has stated that the new bill is necessary to establish regulations for the appointment of watercraft inspectors and staff, as well as for issuing sailor books and identity cards, uniforms, wages, and benefits. The Cabinet meeting approved the bill to be presented in Parliament on July 11, 2024, as stated by the MoPIT. According to Minister Dahal, once the bill is passed in parliament, the regulation of ships operating on internal waterways will ensure safe, high-quality, reliable, regular, and organized services. Additionally, effective implementation will be made for the registration, survey, and flag-related arrangements of ships. Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Dahal said that operating Nepali flag-carrier ships on the oceans will be possible, which will contribute to the country’s economic development. According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982, both coastal and landlocked countries have equal rights in maritime matters. Based on this, Nepal had enacted the Ship Registration Act 2027 BS. However, after the implementation of numerous international treaties, the provisions of the 2027 Act are now insufficient for registering Nepali flag-carrier ships, as these treaties' requirements are not covered by the existing law, the MoPIT has stated. Minister Dahal highlighted the need for legislation regarding the operation of Nepali flag-carrier ships at sea. He pointed out that many Nepali nationals are employed on foreign ships, requiring provisions for sailor books, identification cards, training, health checks, and other related matters, which are not adequately covered under the current legal framework. According to him, the bill is also necessary for internal purposes. He writes, ""Given the operation of various types of ships on rivers and lakes within Nepal, it is essential to regulate their registration and operation, thus promoting internal water transport, which is why I have presented this bill.""",0,0_dahal_nc_kathmandu_president,"['dahal', 'nc', 'kathmandu', 'president', 'chairman', 'said', 'congress', 'uml', 'office', 'secretary']","['PM Dahal reshuffles his cabinet following new alliance with UML Inducts eight ministers from UML, five from Maoist Center, four from RSP and two from Unified Socialist; KATHMANDU, March 6: Newly-appointed ministers from CPN (Maoist Center), CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special function held at the Office of President on Wednesday.

""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing.

NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly.

""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula.

However, since then President Bidya Devi Bhandari repealed that ordinance on September 27, 2021, an amendment bill has been proposed to restore the original provisions of the Act by undoing the legal changes introduced by the repealed ordinance. The bill specifies that, following the repeal of the ordinance concerning subsection 2 of section 33 and subsection 1 of section 48 of the Act, the original provisions will be reinstated. The change being discussed is about the provision in the Act, which states that if 40 percent or more of a party's members in the federal parliament start a new party or join another one, they won't be seen as leaving their original party.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.9899196729902102,False

NEPALGUNJ, Feb 22: Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha has said sluggishness, lack of accountability and impunity are costing dear to governance in the country. Corruption is a huge challenge before us, DPM Shrestha said, suggesting the home administration to maintain peace and law and order. Addressing the Lumbini Province level security seminar here today, DPM Shrestha reminded that the government had aimed at promoting good governance, social justice and prosperity. Crime can be curbed by building peace, he suggested. The DPM viewed people should ensure an atmosphere conducive to their realization of change. It is equally essential to increase public trust in the current system, he underscored. The entire society needs to build positivity for maintaining good governance. ""The concept of 'citizen first' should be internalized and enforced so that public service delivery can be effective. According to him, public security and development works should be taken together. Rule of law, protection of human rights, and social stability are government's priorities, he added. He directed the officials for the cooperation and collaboration among the province and local governments for good governance, stability and development. DPM Shrestha however said administrative and legal frameworks were yet to be built to enforce federalism on full scale. He said that the government was launching special schemes for the poverty-stricken communities. He made the participants aware of the misuse of social networks to disrupt social harmony. ""I direct the subordinates to take immediate action- to the extent of removal from post- against those who work in cahoots with criminals for girls trafficking, financial crimes, internet fraud, among others,"" DPM Shrestha underlined.

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey.

Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula.

Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing.

Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula.

The Federal Secretariat Construction and Management Office has been formed for the purpose of supervising and managing the minister's quarters and for the immediate provision of goods if requested by the members of the minister's family living in the minister's residence. After the ministers change, the Management Office provides new items for the new ministers. The office staff of the management office replaces all the furniture such as carpets, curtains, sofas, etc. used by the ministers and members of the ministers. In this way, changing new furniture costs Rs 500,000 to Rs 600,000 for one residence. The Management Office has set up a unit in the Ministers’ Quarters to provide daily necessities to the ministers and their family members residing in the Ministers’ Quarters, Pulchowk. As soon as the members of a minister's family ask for any item, the secretariat staff make it available immediately. The Ministers’ Quarters in Pulchowk has only 19 blocks where only 19 ministers stay. The rest of the ministers should stay outside the quarters. According to the Federal Secretariat Construction and Management Office sources, after the reshuffle of the Cabinet, all 19 blocks at the Ministers’ Quarters in Pulchowk have been occupied. Upendra Yadav, who was recommended by the Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) as Deputy Prime Minister and Health Minister, will not be able to reside in the Ministers’ Quarters. According to Management Office sources, on Thursday, a member of Yadav's family inquired with the secretariat staff to book a block inside the Ministers’ Quarters at Pulchowk. However, the staff of the secretariat said, ""All the blocks have been booked. Now, even if the Prime Minister comes, we cannot provide a block to him.” An employee of the secretariat says, ""Now he (Yadav) has to stay outside the Ministers’ Quarters. Or one of the ministers there should be forced to stay outside. Out of the 19 blocks in the Ministers’ Quarters, 14 are old and five are new blocks. The Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Home Affairs and ministers holding important ministries usually live in new blocks. The new blocks have some more facilities compared to the old ones. According to Secretariat sources, outgoing Minister of State for Education Pramila Kumari has not yet vacated the ministerial quarters provided to her. In general, the minister is allowed to stay in the quarters for a week after leaving his/her post. According to Secretariat sources, the family members of Home and Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane have booked the D1 block. Earlier too, Lamichhane became the Home Minister along with the Deputy Prime Minister on December 27 last year. As a minister, he stayed in the Ministry of Home Affairs for 32 days. Even then, he was staying in the minister's residence. Similarly, family members of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha have booked the D4 block.

However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.5182825394885776,False

The new Cabinet has 20 ministers including three Deputy Prime Ministers, one each from Maoist Center, UML and RSP. The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from Rastriya Swatantra Party and two from Unified Socialist. Those appointed as ministers from Maoist Center include Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister), Barsha Man Pun (Finance Minister), Shakti Bahadur Basnet (Energy), Rekha Sharma (Information and Communication) and Hit Bahadur Tamang (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation). Shrestha, Sharma and Basnet served as ministers from the Maoist Center in the previous Dahal-led Cabinet with Nepali Congress.

In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties. As Prime Minister Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with Nepali Congress (NC), NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has also expedited his initiative to strengthen the party’s alliance with other parties in the parliament.

KATHMANDU, March 3: As mistrust and tensions deepen between ruling Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the likelihood of a new political alliance is rapidly gaining traction. The emerging coalition is anticipated to involve the Maoist Center, CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position.

Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist).

KATHMANDU, March 15: The team investigating the Suryadarshan Cooperative scam is about to be removed from the Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police. While an investigation is being conducted against GB Rai, the business partner of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, the team working on the investigation along with Chief AIG Kiran Bajcharya of CIB is about to be removed. After the victims of Pokhara's Suryadarshan Cooperative Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization filed a complaint, Nepal Police started an investigation against the chairman of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Rabi Lamichhane. After receiving the 'green signal' from Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the investigation was started against Lamichhane, who is also a former director of Galaxy TV. The CIB of Nepal Police is also investigating the matter. The then Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha called CIB Chief AIG Kiran Bajracharya to the ministry and instructed them to start investigating Lamichhane as well. According to CIB sources, AIG Bajracharya initially consulted with the secretary and high-ranking staff of the Prime Minister's Office. After that she also consulted with Prime Minister Dahal. “This investigation was started after a discussion with the Prime Minister. The CIB is engaged in the investigation to get the results,'' the source said. Regarding the Suryadarshan cooperative fraud case, the cooperative victims filed a supplementary application on February 5. After that, both the Prime Minister and the Home Minister have increased interest in it. While the case related to the fraud case of Suryadarshan Cooperative was pending in the District Court, Kaski, a complaint against the fraud was also filed in the police. Earlier, last August, a complaint was filed with the police. Home Minister Lamichhane himself has been implicated in the cooperative fraud case. Sources said that when questions were raised about him both in parliament and on the streets, the CIB’s cooperative fraud investigation team was accused in a gold smuggling case. ""The Home Minister wanted to remove the CIB chief on Thursday. After meeting with the Prime Minister this morning, he has given instructions to the IGP to remove AIG Bajracharya.

The new Cabinet has 20 ministers including three Deputy Prime Ministers, one each from Maoist Center, UML and RSP. The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from Rastriya Swatantra Party and two from Unified Socialist. Those appointed as ministers from Maoist Center include Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister), Barsha Man Pun (Finance Minister), Shakti Bahadur Basnet (Energy), Rekha Sharma (Information and Communication) and Hit Bahadur Tamang (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation). Shrestha, Sharma and Basnet served as ministers from the Maoist Center in the previous Dahal-led Cabinet with Nepali Congress. Similarly, Prime Minister Dahal has appointed UML leaders Raghu Bir Mahaseth (Deputy Prime Minister and Physical Infrastructure), Padam Giri (Law), Jwala Kumari Shah (Agriculture), Damodar Bhandari (Industry), Rajendra Rai (Drinking Water), Hari Upreti (Defense), Bhagawati Chaudhary (Women and Children) and Bal Ram Adhikari (Land Reform Management) as his Cabinet colleagues.

Madhav Kumar Nepal-led Unified Socialist has sent Dhan Bahadur Budha (Urban Development) and Bhanu Bhakta Jaisi (Federal Affairs and General Administration) as ministers in the Dahal-led Cabinet. In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties.

The emerging coalition is anticipated to involve the Maoist Center, CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position. It is anticipated that the NC will convene a separate meeting to decide its stance before the alliance meeting on Monday."", 'PM Dahal prepares to seek vote of confidence by March 13 KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.6190305029658983,False

The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from Rastriya Swatantra Party and two from Unified Socialist. Those appointed as ministers from Maoist Center include Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister), Barsha Man Pun (Finance Minister), Shakti Bahadur Basnet (Energy), Rekha Sharma (Information and Communication) and Hit Bahadur Tamang (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation). Shrestha, Sharma and Basnet served as ministers from the Maoist Center in the previous Dahal-led Cabinet with Nepali Congress.

Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties.

Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot.

Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly.

According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.7668562572550599,False

KATHMANDU, March 3: As mistrust and tensions deepen between ruling Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the likelihood of a new political alliance is rapidly gaining traction. The emerging coalition is anticipated to involve the Maoist Center, CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position. It is anticipated that the NC will convene a separate meeting to decide its stance before the alliance meeting on Monday.",0,0_dahal_nc_kathmandu_president,"['dahal', 'nc', 'kathmandu', 'president', 'chairman', 'said', 'congress', 'uml', 'office', 'secretary']","['PM Dahal reshuffles his cabinet following new alliance with UML Inducts eight ministers from UML, five from Maoist Center, four from RSP and two from Unified Socialist; KATHMANDU, March 6: Newly-appointed ministers from CPN (Maoist Center), CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special function held at the Office of President on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government.

In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.8269854585623382,True

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,1.0,False

Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position. It is anticipated that the NC will convene a separate meeting to decide its stance before the alliance meeting on Monday."", 'PM Dahal prepares to seek vote of confidence by March 13 KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,1.0,False

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

He briefed the media that the Chinese side is positive for ensuring trans-border pastureland for the Nepali community residing on the Nepal-China border as per the agreement reached in 2012 and electrification at some Nepali villages there. Similarly, the Chinese side responded positively to the call of Nepal to resume the Kathmandu-Lhasa direct bus service, facilitating the exports of buff, medicinal herbs, vegetables, and fruits from Nepal to China. During the discussions, Minister Shrestha urged China to establish multi-dimensional labs in certain areas along the Nepal-China border and provide capital and technological assistance to enhance Nepal's agricultural sector productivity. Both parties have been positive about operating the flights from Kathmandu and Pokhara to various cities in China.

Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice.

However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold.

Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance.

PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.6249231699401794,False

Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing.

NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula.

The Terms of Reference (ToR) of the parliamentary probe committee was finalized in a meeting held on Tuesday, which was agreed upon by a Task Force meeting held at the Prime Minister's official residence in Baluwatar for three and a half hours on Monday evening. With the agreement on the TOR, the impasse seen in Parliament has come to an end. The NC had been continuously disrupting Parliament since the second week of March, demanding the resignation of Home Minister Lamichhane, alleging that the money transferred to Gorkha Media Group from the Supreme Cooperative of Butwal and Suryadarshan Cooperative of Pokhara was embezzled. On May 18, a Task Force comprising NC Joint General Secretary Jeevan Pariyar, UML Chief Whip Mahesh Bertaula, and RSP lawmaker Shishir Khanal was formed under the coordination of Law Minister Padam Giri to determine the ToR of the parliamentary probe committee. The Task Force agreed on four points of jurisdiction on Tuesday and submitted it to Prime Minister Dahal. According to these points, the first point involves studying and suggesting solutions for the crisis in cooperatives, including legal and institutional purposes, financial system regulation, supervision, and transparency. The second point focuses on protecting the savings of those involved in troubled cooperative organizations, recommending ways to return savings that are at risk before they are misused. Similarly, the fourth point of the agreement states that the parliamentary panel will investigate on the several troubled cooperatives including the fund embezzled by Gorkha Media Network to which Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, who is also Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister, is allegedly involved. Earlier, the Task Force could not reach a consensus as the NC insisted that the name of RSP President Lamichhane be included for investigation in the ToR of the parliamentary committee. However, Prime Minister Dahal insisted on agreeing with the NC on this matter. He also went to Budanilkanth to meet NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba to forge consensus on the matter. Prior to that, Prime Minister Dahal also held discussions with NC Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka, General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa, senior leader Krishna Prasad Sitaula, NC Chief Whip Ramesh Lekhak and Central Working Committee Member Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, among others. However, despite reaching an agreement in the Task Force, no final agreement could be reached as the parties maintained their previous positions in all the previous meetings. However, on Monday evening, NC Vice President Khadka, General Secretary Thapa, Sitaula, Lekhak, and members of the Task Force held intense discussion in the presence of Prime Minister Dahal and reached an agreement to form an inquiry committee without mentioning the name of Home Minister Lamichhane. Even though it was agreed to write the name of the problematic cooperative, the NC did not give up its claim that the Managing Director of Gorkha Media Network should be mentioned. However, the NC was convinced to give up that demand during a meeting held on Tuesday morning.",-1,-1_nc_police_chief_oli,"['nc', 'police', 'chief', 'oli', 'kathmandu', 'climate', 'general', 'said', 'shrestha', 'home']","[""NC, UML reach an understanding not to implement BRI projects through loans According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

Those appointed as ministers from Maoist Center include Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister), Barsha Man Pun (Finance Minister), Shakti Bahadur Basnet (Energy), Rekha Sharma (Information and Communication) and Hit Bahadur Tamang (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation).

In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties. As Prime Minister Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with Nepali Congress (NC), NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has also expedited his initiative to strengthen the party’s alliance with other parties in the parliament.

The emerging coalition is anticipated to involve the Maoist Center, CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,1.0,False

Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,1.0,False

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position. It is anticipated that the NC will convene a separate meeting to decide its stance before the alliance meeting on Monday."", 'PM Dahal prepares to seek vote of confidence by March 13 KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,1.0,False

But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

The new Cabinet has 20 ministers including three Deputy Prime Ministers, one each from Maoist Center, UML and RSP. The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from Rastriya Swatantra Party and two from Unified Socialist. Those appointed as ministers from Maoist Center include Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister), Barsha Man Pun (Finance Minister), Shakti Bahadur Basnet (Energy), Rekha Sharma (Information and Communication) and Hit Bahadur Tamang (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation). Shrestha, Sharma and Basnet served as ministers from the Maoist Center in the previous Dahal-led Cabinet with Nepali Congress. Similarly, Prime Minister Dahal has appointed UML leaders Raghu Bir Mahaseth (Deputy Prime Minister and Physical Infrastructure), Padam Giri (Law), Jwala Kumari Shah (Agriculture), Damodar Bhandari (Industry), Rajendra Rai (Drinking Water), Hari Upreti (Defense), Bhagawati Chaudhary (Women and Children) and Bal Ram Adhikari (Land Reform Management) as his Cabinet colleagues. Similarly, four RSP leaders including Rabi Lamichhane (Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister), DP Aryal (Labor, Employment and Social Security), Sumana Shrestha (Education) and Biraj Bhakta Shrestha (Youths and Sports) have been inducted in the Dahal-led Cabinet. Madhav Kumar Nepal-led Unified Socialist has sent Dhan Bahadur Budha (Urban Development) and Bhanu Bhakta Jaisi (Federal Affairs and General Administration) as ministers in the Dahal-led Cabinet. In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties. As Prime Minister Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with Nepali Congress (NC), NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has also expedited his initiative to strengthen the party’s alliance with other parties in the parliament.

The emerging coalition is anticipated to involve the Maoist Center, CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position. It is anticipated that the NC will convene a separate meeting to decide its stance before the alliance meeting on Monday."", 'PM Dahal prepares to seek vote of confidence by March 13 KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.8617518034203915,False
"UML Chair Oli sworn in as Prime Minister for the fourth time KATHMANDU, July 15: After spending nearly six decades in Nepal's communist movement, KP Sharma Oli, 72, has returned to power for a record fourth term as Prime Minister, forging a new coalition with the Nepali Congress (NC) to secure his latest stint at the helm. Inducts 21 ministers in his cabinet, sparks criticisms over inclusivity amid constitutional conundrum KATHMANDU, July 15: After spending nearly six decades in Nepal's communist movement, KP Sharma Oli, 72, has returned to power for a record fourth term as Prime Minister, forging a new coalition with the Nepali Congress (NC) to secure his latest stint at the helm. Born in 1952 in Nepal's Terhathum district, Oli's early activism against the autocratic Panchayat system led to a lengthy imprisonment of 14 years from 1973 to 1987 during which he continued his intellectual pursuits, including writing poetry on cigarette boxes. Having first assumed office as Prime Minister in 2015, he was re-elected in 2018 and reappointed briefly in 2021 in Nepal's unsettling parliament. His tenure has been marked by both popularity and controversy. His return to power follows the collapse of Pushpa Kamal Dahal's coalition government after CPN-UML, chaired by Oli withdrew its support to Dahal-led Maoist Center, prompting President Ram Chandra Paudel to appoint Oli under Article 76(2) of Nepal's Constitution. This move came after Dahal failed to secure a vote of confidence in parliament, paving the way for Oli to form a new government. Controversial cabinet formation After taking the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special ceremony held at the Office of President, PM Oli inducted 22 ministers in his cabinet. The Oli-led cabinet now includes ministers from the NC, UML, Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP)-led by Ashok Rai and Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP)-led by Mahantha Thakur. While Prime Minister Oli has appointed 10 ministers including a deputy prime minister from the NC, he has appointed eight ministers from his own party, UML, two from JSP and one from the LSP. Since the prime minister has set aside three ministries for fringe parties, other parties in the federal parliament are also expected to join his cabinet later. The 22-member cabinet notably lacks diversity, raising concerns about inclusivity. Despite expectations, senior UML leader Chabilal Bishwakarma was excluded from the list, highlighting internal party dynamics. The cabinet's formation drew criticism for its minimal representation of marginalized groups, particularly the Dalit community, and low female participation. Only two women were appointed as ministers, with Arzu Rana Deuba assuming the role of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Bidya Bhattarai as Minister for Education. Lawmakers within parliament voiced objections, with MP Sobita Gautam questioning the government's commitment to constitutional guarantees of diversity. Speaking at the parliament on Monday, she emphasized the need for meaningful representation of women and Dalits in governance, calling for transparency and accountability in the cabinet formation process. Legal challenges await The appointment of sharp-tongued Oli as the PM is not without controversy. Following the unveiling of his cabinet on Monday, Prime Minister Oli's tenure faces immediate legal scrutiny. A writ petition has been filed at the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of Oli's recent appointment under Article 76(2) of the Constitution. The petition, filed by Khagendra Chapagain, Shailendra Gupta and Deepak Adhikari, seeks to annul Oli's appointment and urges adherence to Article 76(3) for the selection of a new prime minister. This constitutional provision stipulates that if a government fails to secure a vote of confidence, the President must appoint the leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives. The petitioners argue that this provision should have been invoked following the collapse of Pushpa Kamal Dahal's coalition government, asserting that Sher Bahadur Deuba, leader of the Nepali Congress (NC), should rightfully assume the prime ministership. Why the Article 76(3) should have been invoked The petitioners—Khagendra Chapagain, Shailendra Gupta, and Deepak Adhikari—contend that the President’s decision to appoint KP Sharma Oli was unconstitutional for several reasons. Firstly, if a government fails to secure a vote of confidence, the President should proceed with appointing the leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives under Article 76(3). Since Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s coalition government fell short in gaining confidence, the petitioners assert that Article 76(3) should have been applied, requiring the appointment of Deuba, leader of the NC, as Prime Minister. Secondly, the petitioners argue a misapplication of constitutional provisions, asserting that Article 76(2) was improperly utilized to appoint Oli despite the circumstances demanding adherence to Article 76(3). This misstep, they claim, violated the constitutional mandate intended to ensure proper parliamentary representation and stability. Lastly, under Article 76(3), if coalition negotiations fail or a Prime Minister cannot be appointed through other means, the President is mandated to appoint the leader of the largest party in the House. Given that the NC holds the highest number of seats in the current parliament, the petitioners maintain that Sher Bahadur Deuba, as the leader of the largest party, was the rightful candidate for the Prime Ministerial position, emphasizing the constitutional duty to respect the electoral mandate of the Nepali people.

Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year.

""Agriculture is the backbone of a country's development. But the problems of farmers are still not sorted out. The budget allocated for the agro sector could not resolve the problems,"" he said.

Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,1.0,False
"HoR endorses Bill to amend TJ Act, paving way for resolution of conflict-era HR violation cases KATHMANDU, Aug 15: The House of Representatives (HoR) has passed the much-awaited Bill on Transitional Justice (TJ), which seeks to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth, and Reconciliation Commission (Third Amendment) Act 2024. KATHMANDU, Aug 15: The House of Representatives (HoR) has passed the much-awaited Bill on Transitional Justice (TJ), which seeks to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth, and Reconciliation Commission (Third Amendment) Act 2024. The Bill, presented by Minister for Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya, was endorsed with a majority vote, with only Prem Suwal, a lawmaker from the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party (NWPP), opposing it. This legislation marks a significant step forward in Nepal’s ongoing efforts to address transitional justice issues that have remained unresolved for 18 years since the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA). The prolonged delay in addressing these issues has been a source of contention and pain for the victims of the conflict, making the passage of this bill particularly critical in the country's journey toward lasting peace and reconciliation. On August 1, after intense negotiations among the top leadership of the three major political parties—Nepali Congress (NC), CPN-UML, and Maoist Center—a significant agreement was reached on the contentious issues within the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Bill. This consensus paved the way for the bill to move forward in the legislative process. The negotiations addressed key issues such as the definition of grave human rights violations, the necessity of obtaining victims’ consent for reconciliation efforts, and compensation for those affected by the conflict, including security personnel. These agreed-upon amendments were instrumental in aligning the bill with international standards and ensuring justice for all parties involved. Following the agreement, the TRC Bill, was presented to the House of Representatives (HoR) on August 14. Addressing the HoR meeting, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli emphasized the government's commitment to enacting the Bill into law within the next ten days. Following its passage from the lower house of the federal parliament, the Bill will now move to the National Assembly. Once approved by the National Assembly, which is the upper house of the federal parliament, it will be certified by the Speaker before being sent to the president for authentication. Upon receiving the president's approval, the Bill will finally become law. The government initially registered the bill in the House of Representatives on March 9, 2023. Before it was passed by the Law, Justice, and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives, the top leaders of the three major political parties—Nepali Congress, UML, and Maoist Center—reached an agreement on the previously contentious issues within the bill. During the HoR session, parliamentarians praised the recent agreement on the transitional justice bill, calling it a model for the world in establishing peace. This sentiment was echoed during discussions on the bill. Parliamentarians highlighted the consensus reached on the TRC Bill as a positive and exemplary achievement, demonstrating the power of national unity in addressing complex issues. PM Oli remarked, ""Our peace process is homegrown, developed in our own unique way, which is why it has been successful."" He further asserted that Nepal's approach to peace and conflict management stands as a global model. ""Over the past 18 years, we have made substantial progress in managing conflicts,"" Oli said during the meeting. Likewise, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba affirmed that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Bill aligns with international standards. Deuba highlighted that the bill is in compliance with legal requirements, the Supreme Court's ruling, and global benchmarks. Deuba conveyed his belief that the bill will be positively received by the international community and other relevant stakeholders. He also noted that the bill, once enacted, will guarantee justice for all those affected by the conflict. Madhav Kumar Nepal, chairman of CPN (Unified Socialist), became emotional as he reflected on the history of Nepal's peace process. Speaking at the meeting of the HoR, Nepal recalled the significant events leading up to the peace process. He mentioned the critical agreement reached in Delhi in 2004, expressing disappointment that some may have forgotten the contributions of others, including Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, in bringing about the peace process. Nepal recounted his journey to Delhi in late November 2, 2004, where he initiated contact with Maoist Chairman Dahal to finalize the agreement. He mentioned discussions with leaders of the communist party and even considered traveling to Kerala if no other options were available. He addressed the ongoing rumors about India's involvement in Nepal's peace process, noting that his key supporters included current Prime Minister Oli, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, and Sher Bahadur Deuba. Nepal emphasized that the peace process was not achieved through minor challenges, stressing that it was a collective effort that involved significant sacrifices. Nepal also highlighted the importance of the peace agreement signed on November 20, 2008, in Kathmandu. He mentioned his initial reluctance to attend the signing ceremony, feeling frustrated at the time, but eventually attended at the request of Girija Prasad Koirala and Dahal. Prem Suwal, a Member of Parliament from the Nepal Workers Peasants Party, who opposed the bill, raised concerns about whether the goal of the Maoist people's war was to establish a capitalist republic where a minority exploits and rules the majority. He questioned the original demands of the people's war, the identity of the leaders who led the conflict, the sources of fighter training and weapons, and which demands have been fulfilled or remain unmet. Suwal urged for clarification on these issues. Meanwhile, speaking at the meeting, Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) Chairman Rajendra Lingden complained that the parties did not remember the former king Gyanendra Shah when they reached an agreement to end transitional justice. Lingden made this complaint claiming that the former king had contributed to the peace process. ""When talking about the peace process, I would like to humbly request the parties to thank each other,"" Lingden said, ""Whether you call it a people's war or a rebellion, the leader who led it said it himself, this is not a rebellion battle that ended in defeat. It was concluded by agreement.” Lingden claimed that the then king was a party to that agreement. “You should have remembered the king today, the parties should have remembered. The king who was ready to abdicate and supported the peace process should be remembered today. I think you should not be so prejudiced,” he said. “Didn't he contribute to the conclusion of this peace process?' Lingden questioned. ""The parties should have recommended the king for the Nobel Peace Prize for helping the peace process,"" said Lingden. Lingden expressed his happiness that there was consensus to finalize the Transitional Justice Bill and the RPP agreed that the victims should get justice and the peace process should be concluded. Janata Samajwadi Party MP Ranju Kumari Jha highlighted Nepal's achievement in establishing peace, emphasizing that the bill reinforces national consensus and showcases Nepal’s ability to conclude its peace process independently. Similarly, Janamat Party MP Abdul Khan praised Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhesi leader Upendra Yadav for their roles in the peace process, noting that the bill addresses victims' needs. Ram Prakash Chaudhary of the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party called the agreement a global example and expressed hope for justice and compensation for victims. Nagarik Unmukti Party MP Ganga Ram Chaudhary urged justice for those wrongfully prosecuted during the Tikapur rebellion and advocated for including the Lal Commission report in the bill. Criticizing the peace process, independent MP Prabhu Sah claimed that the bill has been compromised by self-serving leaders. He argued that the core of the process has been lost. Dr Amaresh Kumar Singh reflected on the contributions of the late PM Girija Prasad Koirala but expressed concern over post-2006 disorder and foreign influence. He urged leaders to focus on solving the nation’s issues. Independent MP Yogendra Mandal expressed hope for justice for conflict victims and called for dignity in Parliament's actions, urging justice for the wrongfully imprisoned.",0,0_dahal_nc_kathmandu_president,"['dahal', 'nc', 'kathmandu', 'president', 'chairman', 'said', 'congress', 'uml', 'office', 'secretary']","['PM Dahal reshuffles his cabinet following new alliance with UML Inducts eight ministers from UML, five from Maoist Center, four from RSP and two from Unified Socialist; KATHMANDU, March 6: Newly-appointed ministers from CPN (Maoist Center), CPN-UML, CPN (Unified Socialist) and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took the oath of office and secrecy amidst a special function held at the Office of President on Wednesday.

Leaders from the RSP warned the ruling coalition that the party will bring down the government if it initiates the move for . “Discussions among political parties to remove the deputy speaker over an unsubstantiated claim of abuse of authority are unacceptable in democracy,” Chief whip of the RSP Santosh Pariyar said, “The RSP will bring down the ruling coalition with sheer numbers in the streets if it moves forward with such an undemocratic practice.” Lawmaker Devendra Paudel of the Maoist Center claimed that some ministers of the sitting cabinet would need to resign first if the ethical standard applied to Rana by the ruling parties is applied to all leaders. “If the deputy speaker has to vacate her post on the basis of allegations, the ruling coalition should remember that a number of sitting ministers have also been alleged of involvement in scandals,” he said, “Will the ministers said to be involved in the Bhutanese refugee scandal, Baluwatar land grab and Giribandhu scandal also tender their resignation?” He claimed that the Maoist Center will stand by the deputy speaker amid mounting pressure from the ruling coalition for her resignation. Former Minister for Information and Communications Gokul Baskota urged Rana to step down from her position citing the example of his own resignation following the leak of a sound clip whereby he demanded a bribe of Rs 700 million. “When the character of such an office-bearer is under doubt, the right way out is to prove innocence by stepping down and providing an explanation,” he said during the meeting. Other lawmakers from the CPN-UML including Surya Prasad Dhakal, Shobha Gyawali, Saraswati Subba also demanded Rana’s resignation, warning that if she does not resign, they will be compelled to remove her for not adhering to the conduct expected of her position. The HoR witnessed a heated debate regarding the resignation which has been described as a move from the ruling coalition to find a majority in the constitutional council. Currently, three members of the constitutional council, which makes recommendations for appointment and dismissal of the head of various constitutional bodies, are from the opposition parties. The present council comprises of non-partisan Chief Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha; Chairperson of the National Assembly Narayan Prasad Dahal and Leader of the main opposition party Pushpa Kamal Dahal from Maoist Center; deputy speaker Rana from the RSP; Speaker of the HoR Dev Raj Ghimire from CPN-UML and the president of the council PM Oli.",-1,-1_nc_police_chief_oli,"['nc', 'police', 'chief', 'oli', 'kathmandu', 'climate', 'general', 'said', 'shrestha', 'home']","[""NC, UML reach an understanding not to implement BRI projects through loans According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan.

KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

Shrestha, Sharma and Basnet served as ministers from the Maoist Center in the previous Dahal-led Cabinet with Nepali Congress.

Madhav Kumar Nepal-led Unified Socialist has sent Dhan Bahadur Budha (Urban Development) and Bhanu Bhakta Jaisi (Federal Affairs and General Administration) as ministers in the Dahal-led Cabinet. In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties. As Prime Minister Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with Nepali Congress (NC), NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has also expedited his initiative to strengthen the party’s alliance with other parties in the parliament.

Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition.

However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold.

Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.9071246159538134,False

KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur. The role of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Siddhi Bikram Shah remains unoccupied after his transfer to the Police Headquarters, with no chief appointed during this period. Currently, SP Nawraj Karki is serving as the acting chief. There is a provision for the transfer of the SSP to be made by the decision of the Home Minister. According to sources at the police headquarters, as Narayan Kaji Shrestha, the senior vice chairman of the CPN (Maoist Center), is the home minister, he is seeking for a police officer closer to him, so he is delaying the process of transferring the new chief. Although Home Minister Shrestha had recently asserted that he would not interfere in transfers or promotions at the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee, sources suggest that his secretariat\'s team is hindering the appointment process for a new chief at Lalitpur Police Range. The Nepal Police Headquarters is considering the transfer of SSPs Dinesh Acharya, Rajendra Bhatt, or Dinesh Mainali. However, competition and internal conspiracies among the SSPs are impeding the appointment. The Police Headquarters had planned to transfer either SSP Dinesh Acharya from the Central Investigation Bureau, Rajendra Bhatt from the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, or Dinesh Mainali from the Kathmandu Valley Police Office to Lalitpur Police Range. A source stated, ""If there is no pressure from any power center, the police headquarters is ready to transfer one of them."" Sources indicate that the transfer of SSPs Acharya, Bhatt, and Mainali, who have not been assigned in charge since their promotion to SSP, is likely. Mainali, as the spokesperson for the Kathmandu Valley, is slated for transfer, having not served in an in-charge capacity previously. SSP Bhatt, currently a spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metropolitan Traffic Division, has held the position for 14 months. SSP Acharya, working in the CIB, conducted an investigation into the smuggling of 60 kg of gold from Hong Kong. ""As the senior police officers are Acharya and Bhatt, the Inspector General of Police Basanta Kuwar also wants to transfer one of them as the chief of the Police Range,"" mentioned a source from the police headquarters. Besides them, some officers have been assigned to lead Lalitpur district based on their abilities, while others have secured positions based on their connections. Certain SSPs are actively seeking transfers through Home Minister Shrestha\'s team, with some already visiting the secretariats of Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. An SSP commented, ""Everyone has a desire to command, and nothing happens without the blessings of power."" Several SSPs, including Himalaya Kumar Shrestha, Shekhar Khanal, Bishwa Adhikari, Deepak Regmi, Sanuram Bhattarai, Prabin Pokharel, and Mukunda Marasini, have expressed their interest in assuming the position of chief at Lalitpur Police Range. After the death of two youths who wanted to go for foreign employment due to the use of \'lethal\' force by the police in Lalitpur\'s Balkumari on Friday, the chief of Lalitpur Police Range, SSP Shah was transferred to the Police Headquarters. SSP Shah assumed the post of Lalitpur Police Range chief a year ago. As his transfer period has also expired, the Police Headquarters has transferred him. Birendra Shah of Achham was hit in the stomach by a bullet fired by security personnel in Lalitpur. It has been confirmed that Shah was shot by the self-loading rifle (SLR) fired by the police. Bruises were found on the chest of Sujan Rawat, a resident of Dailekh. Security officials said that Sujan was not shot, but may have died in the stampede. Last Friday, those seeking to work in Korea through the Employment Permit System (EPS) gathered at the EPS Korea branch in Gwarko as early as 7AM that day. Those who failed in the examination taken for the shipbuilding company demanded to be allowed to fill the form in the manufacturing sector as well. During the clashes, the situation became tense beyond the control of the security personnel. Dozens of demonstrators and police were injured during the clashes. As three ministers were also found guilty in the incident, those MPs are facing controversies in the parliamentary committee and social media with public protesting and demanding their resignation. Home Minister Narayankaji Shrestha, Labor Minister Sharat Singh Bhandari and Physical and Infrastructure Minister Prakash Jwala have been demanded to resign.', ""NC caught in persistent factional tension over senior leaders' hierarchy There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. KATHMANDU, Dec 19: As part of the Nepali Congress (NC)'s 100-day campaign, the Koshi Province Committee announced that a provincial conference would be held in Biratnagar on December 7, with party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and other party officials set to participate. However, four days earlier, on December 3, those close to NC leader Shekhar Koirala held a separate conference in Biratnagar, inaugurated by Koirala himself. Leader Koirala did not participate in the conference organized by the party's Koshi Province Committee. While leaders in Kathmandu were rushing to Biratnagar, Koirala left for another program. This not only brought the factional conflict within the largest party in the federal parliament to the surface once again but also pushed the dispute over the hierarchy to the fore. The rival faction has maintained that Koirala, who was nominated for the post of president in the 14th NC General Convention, should be placed after Deuba. A leader said that although President Deuba seemed flexible in placing Koirala second—who is currently ranked 25th in the party's hierarchy—the dispute at the Koshi Province Conference persisted, as others were not willing to concede. Although a leader close to Koirala claimed that this was not the only issue of contention, the dispute over hierarchy has been ongoing since the first meeting after the 14th General Convention. There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

The new Cabinet has 20 ministers including three Deputy Prime Ministers, one each from Maoist Center, UML and RSP. The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from Rastriya Swatantra Party and two from Unified Socialist. Those appointed as ministers from Maoist Center include Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister), Barsha Man Pun (Finance Minister), Shakti Bahadur Basnet (Energy), Rekha Sharma (Information and Communication) and Hit Bahadur Tamang (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation). Shrestha, Sharma and Basnet served as ministers from the Maoist Center in the previous Dahal-led Cabinet with Nepali Congress. Similarly, Prime Minister Dahal has appointed UML leaders Raghu Bir Mahaseth (Deputy Prime Minister and Physical Infrastructure), Padam Giri (Law), Jwala Kumari Shah (Agriculture), Damodar Bhandari (Industry), Rajendra Rai (Drinking Water), Hari Upreti (Defense), Bhagawati Chaudhary (Women and Children) and Bal Ram Adhikari (Land Reform Management) as his Cabinet colleagues.

Madhav Kumar Nepal-led Unified Socialist has sent Dhan Bahadur Budha (Urban Development) and Bhanu Bhakta Jaisi (Federal Affairs and General Administration) as ministers in the Dahal-led Cabinet. In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties.

KATHMANDU, March 3: As mistrust and tensions deepen between ruling Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the likelihood of a new political alliance is rapidly gaining traction. The emerging coalition is anticipated to involve the Maoist Center, CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position. It is anticipated that the NC will convene a separate meeting to decide its stance before the alliance meeting on Monday."", 'PM Dahal prepares to seek vote of confidence by March 13 KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13.

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,1.0,False

KATHMANDU, Nov 23: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) and CPN-UML have reached an understanding not to implement any projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI) through loans. The parties reached the understanding arguing that the country’s economic situation does not support implementing mega projects through loan. “Our party is not against BRI. But our economic condition now does not support implementing any major projects through loans. We have an understanding with the UML that our country cannot afford to execute any major projects through loans,” said NC lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada. Prime Minister Oli is visiting China on December 2 at the official invitation of his Chinese counterpart. One of the main agenda, according to government sources, has been the implementation of projects under BRI, to which Nepal signed in 2017. The ruling NC and UML were earlier at odds whether to implement BRI projects by taking concessional loans from China. While the NC has remained opposed to executing any projects under loans, the UML stood in favor of implementing the projects even if it involves taking loans. Amid this difference, Prime Minister Oli on Thursday had canceled the scheduled cabinet meeting and held discussions with top NC leaders to forge consensus. The meeting, according to leaders from both the parties, reached a consensus that the country should not take additional burden of loan as the economy is not in a good financial health. NC, according to leaders, has asked PM Oli to urge the Chinese government to waive the loan given to build Pokhara Regional International Airport and seek Chinese assistance to prepare DPR of Kerung-Kathmandu railway to expedite railway construction works. “This will help take our relations to a new high,” said lawmaker Khatiwada, who is also the chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives. Prime Minister Oli hinted about the understanding reached between the two parties while addressing an awareness rally held by his party in Kathmandu on Friday. Oli said that Nepal is not in position to take loans from any countries now. “We will try our best not to take loans from any country. We have neither the intention nor the condition to take out a loan. But we need to increase our production and bring prosperity on our own,” the prime minister said, while dispelling concerns that Nepal is taking huge loans from China to implement BRI projects. With this development, Nepal is less likely to sign the draft implementation plan for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during Prime Minister Oli's visit to China, although PM Oli has a particular interest in implementing some of the BRI projects. Sources said NC and UML leaders are still exploring a middle-ground approach to resolve their differences on the BRI. While some projects can be funded through grants, others can be undertaken through concessional loans after making a thorough review of the laws related to the BRI, the leaders opined. According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister Oli's visit to China will highly likely focus more on implementing previous agreements rather than signing the BRI project implementation plan. The Chinese side has reportedly conveyed its willingness to accept whatever proposal the ruling coalition puts forward, although PM Oli has shown a particular interest in the BRI projects. In 2019, following Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Nepal, China proposed a framework for the implementation of BRI projects. The assistance of Rs 56 billion announced by President Xi at the time has also not been implemented. Earlier, during separate visits to China by former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and former Foreign Minister Narayan Kaji Shrestha, discussions were held in Nepal regarding the implementation of the BRI project. However, the issue did not progress in China due to the lack of a finalized modality. When Shrestha was the foreign minister, the government had prepared a general framework for the modality. However, it was stalled because the NC, a coalition partner at the time, did not give its approval, and thus the process could not move forward."", 'Lalitpur Police Range without chief for five days following Balkumari incident KATHMANDU, Jan 3: The position of the Chief at Lalitpur Police Range has been vacant for five days following the Balkumari incident that resulted in the death of two individuals in Balkumari, Lalitpur.

There is no provision for a senior leader in the NC statute except during the unification of the NC and the then NC (Democratic) in 2007. Party leaders and cadres have been assigning various nicknames to leaders based on their compatibility and closeness. Deuba, who was also elected as President in the 14th General Convention of the party, had placed Ram Chandra Poudel in second place after him. Those close to Deuba claim that Koirala should now be given that position after Poudel became the President. However, Koirala has told those close to him that he is not interested in the ranking issue. In the 14th General Convention held between November and December 2021, Deuba, Koirala, Prakash Man Singh, Bimalendra Nidhi, and Kalyan Gurung were candidates for the presidency. According to the election results, Koirala was Deuba's closest rival. Although the dispute over the order of precedence is not new within the NC, there was also disagreement in the past over whether to prioritize Ram Chandra Poudel as the second-ranking leader. Despite the disagreement, the leaders eventually agreed to place Poudel second. After the 13th General Convention, when there was a similar dispute, five central members attended the meeting but completed their term without signing the decision book. Former Vice President Gopal Man Shrestha, former General Secretary Kul Bahadur Gurung, and former Joint General Secretaries Ram Sharan Mahat, Arjun Narsingh KC, and Ramesh Lekhak were among those who refused to sign, asserting that their positions in the ranking order should be higher. Shrestha has claimed that he is the most senior leader in the party after Girija Prasad Koirala. He has also expressed dissatisfaction over being placed tenth in the hierarchy, despite his seniority after President Deuba and senior leader Poudel. In the ranking order, former General Secretaries Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Sitaula were placed above Shrestha, while former General Secretary Gurung ranked below him. Mahat and KC, both from Nuwakot, have occasionally disputed their relative rankings, with KC claiming seniority over Mahat. However, since Mahat served as the party's joint general secretary before KC, he was ranked higher. At that time, Mahat was placed 16th and KC 17th in the hierarchy. A similar dispute over precedence arose after the 12th General Convention. There was also a dispute between Bal Krishna Khand and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki regarding their ranking. Additionally, a disagreement between Prakash Man Singh and Bimalendra Nidhi led to then-NC (Democratic) President Deuba creating the position of party vice president. Deuba promoted Singh to vice president and assigned Nidhi as general secretary, which left tensions between the two leaders unresolved. Although the NC has formed committees to resolve disputes over the order of precedence, no lasting solution has yet been achieved.""]",nc - police - chief - oli - kathmandu - climate - general - said - shrestha - home,0.0,False

KATHMANDU, March 10: Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take the vote of confidence by March 13. PM Dahal discussed this at the CPN (Maoist Centre)’s parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday afternoon. According to a member of parliament who attended the meeting, the party leaders discussed that the prime minister should take a vote of confidence from the Parliament by next week. Accordingly, MPs have been issued a whip not to leave the valley for a few days. The next meeting of the Parliament has been called for March 13. However, the prime minister also briefed during the meeting that if he deems it necessary, the vote of confidence can be taken on March 10 or 11. Lawmaker Hit Raj Pandey, who is also the chief whip of CPN (Maoist Center), said their party has issued a whip to the lawmakers concerned not to leave the capital until the prime minister takes a vote of confidence and the election of the National Assembly’s chairperson is held. ""Instructions have been issued to the members of the House of Representatives to be present during the vote of confidence,"" said Pandey. On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC). Dahal had formed an alliance with the NC after the general elections in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over the presidential candidate. Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). The ministers, who assumed their respective offices on Wednesday itself, include five from Maoist Center, eight from UML, four from RSP and two from CPN (Unified Socialist). Similarly, as per the constitutional provision, prime ministers have to take a vote of confidence after any ally withdraws support. In the parliamentary party meeting held on Saturday, Prime Minister Dahal briefed that he took the step to form a new ministerial team after the previous alliance became uncomfortable to work with. “Working together with Nepali Congress turned out to be incompatible, while the government aspired to lead development amid ongoing centralization, political polarity and defending national sovereignty,” Dahal said. Dahal however defended that he stepped up for a fresh coalition not just to protect his seat of prime minister. “The position was supposed to remain intact for at least the next one year. However, it became tougher to give result-oriented outcomes, while the national interest and national economy appeared weak, due to the non-cooperation from the Nepali Congress.” Likewise, Chairman of the ruling CPN-UML KP Sharma Oli has said that the current UML-CPN (Maoist Center) alliance will continue for the next four years even as power centers are active to break it. He mentioned that it was not possible to consult the party before forging political alliance with the Maoist Center due to the complicated situation. “But the success we achieved is great,” a party official quoted Oli as saying in the briefing. Nepali Congress (NC) has decided to nominate a candidate for the post of the chairman of the National Assembly. Leader Arjun Narsingh KC said that a meeting of office bearers held on Saturday at the residence of party President Sher Bahadur Deuba at Budhanilkantha decided to nominate a candidate for the post of chairman. NC has also decided to discuss with other opposition parties to seek support for the chairman of the National Assembly. The party has said that the selection of candidates will be done after the meeting of the members of the National Assembly. This decision comes in the wake of the vacancy left by Ganesh Prasad Timilsina, who recently concluded his six-year tenure as the Speaker of the National Assembly. Previously, the NC had been firm to elect the senior leader of the party Krishna Prasad Sitaula. However, it will be an uphill battle for the political party with the largest number of lawmakers to elect its nominated candidate after the downfall of its alliance with the government.']",dahal - nc - kathmandu - president - chairman - said - congress - uml - office - secretary,0.764408386812724,False

Those appointed as ministers from Maoist Center include Narayan Kaji Shrestha (Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister), Barsha Man Pun (Finance Minister), Shakti Bahadur Basnet (Energy), Rekha Sharma (Information and Communication) and Hit Bahadur Tamang (Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation).

In terms of seniority among three DPMs, Mahaseth has been ranked right after PM Dahal followed by DPM Shrestha and Lamichhane. Prime Minister Dahal is expected to induct a few ministers in the days ahead as negotiations are still underway with the JSP and other fringe parties. All ministers representing NC had resigned from their posts en masse on Tuesday after the Maoist Center and UML along with other parties reached an agreement to forge a new political alliance. Meanwhile, the JSP led by Upendra Yadav has stated that it will abstain from participating in the government unless the continuity of the current leadership of Madhesh Province government is ensured. A meeting of the party’s executive committee failed to reach any consensus to join the government as a majority of the executive members advised the party Chairman Yadav against joining the government. The key condition set by the JSP is that the current leadership of the Madhesh Provincial government should be allowed to continue. At present, the JSP leads the provincial government in Madhesh Province. JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav has formally signed the eight-point agreement formulated by the four participating parties. As Prime Minister Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with Nepali Congress (NC), NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has also expedited his initiative to strengthen the party’s alliance with other parties in the parliament.

KATHMANDU, March 3: As mistrust and tensions deepen between ruling Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the likelihood of a new political alliance is rapidly gaining traction. The emerging coalition is anticipated to involve the Maoist Center, CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP). During a three-hour discussion at the residence of JSP Chairman Upendra Yadav, key figures, including UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, Maoist Center's Vice President Narayan Kaji Shrestha, Deputy General Secretary Barshaman Pun and Chairman Yadav, have reportedly reached consensus on fundamental issues for the new political alliance. Sources claim that in the proposed coalition agreement, RSP President Lamichhane is slated to assume the role of Home Minister, along with the portfolio of Deputy Prime Minister, while Dahal will continue as Prime Minister. Additionally, UML is expected to secure the position of National Assembly Speaker. The agreement also foresees the resolution of points of contention in the Bill on Transitional Justice. Following the discussions at Yadav's residence on Sunday, UML Vice Chairman Bishnu Paudel and Maoist Center's Deputy General Secretary Pun engaged once again with Prime Minister Dahal and Oli. The ongoing efforts include the finalization of a blueprint for the new ruling alliance at Oli's residence in Balkot. As the possibility of a new political equation gains momentum, NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba has conveyed to his aides within the party his contemplation of recalling all ministers representing the party from the government or withdrawing from the current coalition. Sources suggest that a crucial meeting of the ruling coalition, scheduled for Monday morning, may determine the fate of the current government. However, there is speculation that the meeting may not take place as the new political dynamics unfold. In response to UML Chairman Oli's increasing proximity to Prime Minister Dahal, NC President Deuba has shared his concerns with party officials. Deuba convened NC ministers at his residence in Budhanilkanth on Sunday, informing them about the latest developments and hinting at the possibility of exiting the alliance. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting on Sunday afternoon, attended by eight ministers and NC leaders, including Krishna Sitaula and Ramesh Lekhak, discussions revolved around Dahal's insistence on having a Maoist as the Chairman of the National Assembly. Deuba expressed the view that the alliance could be jeopardized if the NC did not secure the National Assembly Speaker position.

On March 4, PM Dahal reshuffled his cabinet after breaking his alliance with the Nepali Congress (NC).

Backed by the NC, the government led by Dahal was formed a year ago on December 25, 2022 after agreeing to make Ram Chandra Paudel the president. However, a rift with the NC over the Bill on Transitional Justice led to an abrupt end to the partnership. According to the sources, Prime Minister Dahal wanted to bring new faces in his cabinet amid concerns of under performance by some ministers representing the NC and other coalition partners. Prime Minister Dahal took the initiative after the NC President did not cooperate with his request. With this, a new cabinet was formed on March 6, 2024, which has 20 ministers including three deputy prime ministers, one each from the Maoist Center, CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP).
