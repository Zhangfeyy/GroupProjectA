"Thousands gather in Dublin for ""biggest Irish protest for Palestine in history"" Thousands of demonstrators gathered at the Garden of Remembrance on Saturday afternoon before marching through Dublin to the Department of Foreign Affairs at St. Stephen's Green for a rally. Huge crowds gathered in Dublin on Saturday afternoon to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Thousands of demonstrators gathered at the Garden of Remembrance on Saturday afternoon before marching through Dublin to the Department of Foreign Affairs at St. Stephen's Green for a rally. The Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign organized the ""National Demonstration for Palestine"" as part of a global day of action in support of Palestine. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Protestors also called on the Irish Government to impose sanctions on Israel during Saturday's protest. Saturday's demonstration, which was supported by over 70 different organizations, was the 13th such demonstration to be held in Dublin since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas War on October 7. Demonstrators chanted ""Free, free Palestine"" and ""Ceasefire now"" while others carried banners with slogans such as ""Freedom and Justice for Palestine"". A number of Irish activist groups, political parties, trade unions, and student groups from around the country attended Saturday's protest, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, and the National Women’s Council of Ireland. Saturday's demonstration took place against the backdrop of South Africa's genocide filing against Israel at the International Court of Justice. The Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign described the protest as ""the biggest Irish protest for Palestine in history"" Zoe Lawlor, Chairperson of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said on Saturday that the group was looking for ""action from the Irish Government"" and also called for sanctions to be imposed on Israel. Lawlor also accused the Irish Government of being ""very out of step with the Irish people"", adding that it was ""disappointing"" and ""shameful"" that Ireland didn't support South Africa in the International Court of Justice. ""We want sanctions on Israel, we want the Occupied Territories Bill to be enacted, we want the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill to be enacted,"" Lawlor said on Saturday. The Occupied Territories Bill proposes a ban on any goods or services produced in Israeli-occupied territories, even if the goods were only partially produced there. Meanwhile, the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill seeks to compel the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) to divest itself of holdings in ""illegal"" Israeli settlements. Elsewhere, more than a thousand people gathered in Cork on Saturday for a pro-Palestinian demonstration, while thousands also gathered in London as part of the global day of action. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald addressed protestors in London, stating that she believes Palestinian freedom is possible. ""When I say this, standing in London, in common cause with you, (having) walked our own journey out of conflict, building peace for 25 years, this can happen,"" McDonald told the London crowd on Saturday. ""This must happen and we will ensure that it does.""",2,2_library_street_rising_moore,"['library', 'street', 'rising', 'moore', '1916', 'national', 'trails', 'saturday', 'rural', 'easter']","['Irish Government announces 62 new rural walking trails Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys announced the expansion on Wednesday, taking the total number of nationally recognized walking trails to 140. The Irish Government has announced 62 new walking trails in 17 counties as part of the expansion of its National Walks Scheme. Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys announced the expansion on Wednesday, taking the total number of nationally recognized walking trails to 140. The expansion includes 62 way-marked walks and hikes across the country including five trails on islands Inis Meáin and Oileán Chléire. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! It will also bring National Walk Scheme Trails to Counties Wexford and Monaghan for the first time. The scheme is designed to boost outdoor recreation and rural tourism in Ireland and is a key element of ""Embracing Ireland\'s Outdoors"" - the Irish Government\'s Outdoor Recreation Strategy. The National Walks Scheme provides funding to farmers and other landholders to maintain trails that pass through their land, with over €15 million paid to farmers and landholders since the scheme was launched in 2017. The Government has spent a further €1.4 million on materials and maintenance of the trails. The latest expansion will see an additional annual investment of over €500,000 to rural areas through the scheme. The highlights of the latest expansion include a walking trail at the majestic Devils\' Chimney in County Sligo and a trail at the Ardmore Cliff Walk in County Waterford. The scheme will also install a walking trail at the Dún Fearbhaí loop on Inis Meáin off County Galway. Dún Fearbhaí is a stone ringfort dating back around 2,000 years to the first century AD. Speaking at the launch of the expansion, Humphreys said the scheme will help make Ireland an international destination of choice for walkers and hikers. ""We have a unique offering in terms of our natural landscape filled with mountains, forests, lakes, rivers, and sea,"" Humphreys said in a statement. ""Often these amenities can only be truly appreciated by crossing through fields and land owned by local farmers. The National Walks Scheme is about working in partnership with landowners so we can open up access to local communities and tourists to enjoy these wonderful hidden gems we have all across Ireland. ""I want to acknowledge and thank the work of all the farmers and landowners involved in the Walks Scheme who provide access to their holdings and who help to maintain the trails to a high standard for the benefit of a huge number of locals and visitors. ""Without the goodwill of farmers, we would not have access to many of our favorite tracks and trails. It is incumbent on all of us to use these amenities responsibly, respect local landowners, and of course – Leave No Trace.

Due to the time lapse in the start date, officials will have to seek new government consent to move forward with the 1916 Easter Rising museum located in houses used during the rebel leader\'s retreats. According to reports by the National Monuments Service, Ireland\'s Office of Public Works, an Irish Government agency, that manages most of the Irish State\'s property portfolio, has said it must seek new government consent to move ahead with the plans for a museum on Moore Street, in Dublin city center, dedicated to the Easter Rising 1916. The OPW say it\'s ""difficult to be specific about when work will start on site."" The houses at 14–17 Moore Street are historically significant due to their key role in the final days of the 1916 Easter Rising. After the surrender of the General Post Office (GPO) on O’Connell Street, which had served as the headquarters for the leaders of the Rising, the surviving rebel leaders and their forces were forced to retreat. They made their way to Moore Street, using the terrace of buildings as cover. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The museum, part of the National Monuments Service, was due to open initially in 1916 for the Easter Rising\'s centenary anniversary. Work on the 1916 museum was set to begin in 2023 with an estimated cost of €16.25 million ($17.95m). However, the Irish Times reports that no contractors have been engaged to commence work, by the OPW. An update provided by the Moore Street advisory group provided this week says the OPW would need to seek fresh “ministerial consent” from the Minister for Heritage, due to the passage of time, the Times reports. O\'Connell Bridge, in Dublin, in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising. They stated it would be ""difficult to be specific about when work will start on site”. “Currently, they [the OPW] plan to apply to the Minister for a Ministerial Consent under the National Monuments Act in September and will hope to go out to tender as early as possible in 2025,” the update from the Monuments Service, which is under the aegis of the Department of Heritage said. “It should be stressed that these are estimates only.” Green Party Dublin City Councillor Donna Cooney told the Times she\'d expected construction to begin last year. Cooney said “It appears to have taken more than a year just to decide that a new ministerial consent is needed when we thought work would be well underway by now. It’s nine years since the State purchased this national monument and each year we lose more Moore Street campaigners, elderly people who will now not see the center opened.” The buildings, 14 to 17 Moore Street, were named as a national monument in 2007. This was opened to the public and was approved by An Bord Pleanála (the planning board) in 2010. The houses were bought by the Irish State in 2015. Minister for Heritage, Heather Humphreys, said at the time the buildings were a ""very important element"" of the 1916 centenary plans of 2016. The Easter Rising parade in 2016 in Dublin. Shortly after relatives of the Easter Rising participants took legal action. They asked that most of Moore Street be given national monument status, not just 14 to 17. Several houses on the road were due for demolition and a shopping center was to be built. In 2016, Justice Max Barrett suspended works on the buildings including the 1916 museum. In 2018, the Court of Appeal overturned this ruling. The then minister for heritage, Josepha Madigan, said the opening of the museum would be a “top priority”. In December 2019 her department said they were “not as yet in a position to say when the project will get underway”. In July 2024 the Moore Street Preservation Trust met with the Dublin inner-city task force and presented to the chairperson, David McRedmond, a master plan for transforming Moore Street into a cultural quarter. The great-grandson of James Connolly, an Easter Rising leader, told the Irish Independent “This was a constructive meeting,” James Connolly Heron said. “Our architect Seán Ó Muirí outlined the Moore Street Preservation Trust’s Master Plan. “We believe the plan has the potential to transform this area, preserving our history and creating a vibrant focus for the north inner city. “We emphasized the need to cherish both the 1916 Rising heritage and the street trading tradition of Moore Street. “Mr McRedmond engaged constructively, and we look forward to these issues being positively reflected to the Taoiseach in the Task Force’s report and recommendations.” These houses were the last headquarters of the 1916 Easter leaders. After evacuating the GPO, key leaders of the Rising, including Patrick Pearse, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett, Tom Clarke, and Seán Mac Diarmada, sought refuge in these houses. They moved through the buildings by tunneling through walls to avoid sniper fire from British forces. Easter Rising Leader Padraig Pearse surrenders. It was at 16 Moore Street that the leaders of the Rising held their final council meeting to discuss their next steps. With dwindling resources, heavy casualties, and civilian suffering, they concluded that surrender was the only viable option. Patrick Pearse, the leader of the rebellion, drafted the formal surrender order at 16 Moore Street. The following day, on April 29, 1916, Pearse left from this location to surrender to the British forces. These buildings are considered some of the last surviving physical remnants of the 1916 Rising, making them a crucial part of Ireland\'s national history.', 'New state-of-the-art library unveiled in Kilkenny Mayfair Library has been transformed from an old ballroom into a state-of-the-art library and community facility as part of the development. Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys has unveiled Ireland\'s newest library in Kilkenny City in addition to announcing an investment of €25 million in Ireland\'s public library services. Mayfair Library, a €7.2 million project funded by Kilkenny County Council and the Department of Rural and Local Development, has been transformed from an old ballroom into a state-of-the-art library and community facility as part of the development. Located in the heart of medieval Kilkenny, the library features digital spaces for training and innovation, providing access to 3D printers, 3D scanners, and sewing machines. It also features space for workshops, lectures, training, and community engagement events. Humphreys, who toured the new library, has announced that the additional investment of €25 million will create 11 new public libraries and 12 Next Generation mobile library vehicles, representing one of the most significant investments in Irish library services in recent years. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The new investment will transform the old Dominican Church and Priory in Drogheda into a state-of-the-art library, while it will also create a new flagship library in the Cultural Centre of Finglas, which will also include a 163-seat theater, a café, a gallery, a tourist information bureau, and office space. Elsewhere, the investment will transform a 75-year-old former cinema building in Sligo into a 21st-century library in addition to transforming the old Market House on Monaghan\'s Main Street into a community library facility. In a statement, Humphreys said the new library in Kilkenny will make a huge difference to the local community, adding that the 11 planned libraries will play an important role in rural development. ""I’m delighted to officially open Ireland’s newest library facility – a €7.2 million state-of-the-art project in the heart of Kilkenny City,"" Humphreys said in a statement. ""I’m pleased that my Department of Rural and Community Development was in a position to provide €4.7 million of the overall investment. This facility is on the site of the old Mayfair Ballroom and it has been totally transformed for 21st century use. ""I’m also very pleased today to announce a €25 million investment in our public libraries and library vehicles,"" she continued. ""This will see the delivery of 11 new library facilities across the country, in places such as Drogheda, Bray, New Ross, Swords, Ballymote, and Clonmel. The projects include old churches and priories, cinemas, and market-houses which will be transformed for 21st-century use. This goes to the heart of what we are working to achieve under our five-year rural development strategy, ‘Our Rural Future’. "" I’m very pleased to be making this announcement in Ireland’s newest library in Kilkenny City, which I know will make such a difference to this community for generations to come.

"New Ireland is in “touching distance,” Sinn Féin President says in Belfast With Northern Ireland on the brink of returning to power-sharing, Sinn Féin is ""excited"" for conversations about a new Ireland. Mary Lou McDonald, the President of Sinn Féin, says she is optimistic but not naive about the future of the island of Ireland. During a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, after the DUP said it was conditionally prepared to return to power-sharing, McDonald was asked what her Sinn Féin party colleague Michelle O'Neill's position as 'First Minister in waiting' of Northern Ireland means for their plans for the future of the island of Ireland. Sinn Féin became the largest party in Northern Ireland for the first time during the May 2022 elections. As such, the party, which aspires to a united Ireland, is entitled to the First Minister position once power-sharing, which has been collapsed since February 2022, is restored. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! “Striving for the new Ireland isn’t some kind of dusty, legal, constitutional matter, although it is that,"" McDonald said on Tuesday during the press conference. “It really is about us collectively having a conversation about what Ireland can look like and will look like in the next five years, ten years, 20 years, for the next generations. “For us, one of the challenges is to bring as many people as we possibly can into that conversation. And that has to include people of all religious perspectives, and none, people of every class, color, creed, and of course, it has to include those that define as unionist, as loyalist, as British, because we are very clear that the new Ireland will have within it, British citizens or subjects, whichever sits more comfortably with them, and that has to be part of a big societal dynamic and change. “So it’s very exciting, I feel very excited by that, I feel very optimistic about our future together. “I am not naive, we are not naive. We know that there will be challenges and there will be forces that will push back against change but we are all about a changed Ireland and a new Ireland for everybody. “And what’s more, I think the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. “And I think that’s a very exciting thing and I hope that people will find that a very welcoming conversation full of opportunity and not defined by fear, at all, ever. In the early hours of Tuesday, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, head of the DUP, announced that his party had agreed to a package of measures, paving the way for the long-awaited restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Donaldson said, in part, that the package of measures ""safeguards Northern Ireland’s place in the Union."" Later on Tuesday, responding to McDonald's comments on a ""new Ireland,"" Matthew O'Toole of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) highlighted his party's New Ireland Commission, adding: ""A New Ireland is about all of us, not just one political party."" We are closer now to constitutional change than ever before, and via our @NewIrelandComm we are working to expand the conversation, but to claim a SF FM by itself advances that cause is frankly self-serving. A New Ireland is about all of us, not just one political party. https://t.co/RevqBWei2i",0,0_northern_agreement_british_friday,"['northern', 'agreement', 'british', 'friday', 'good', 'new', 'minister', 'unity', 'future', 'election']","['United Ireland debate among issues looming large in 2024 Regardless of election outcomes in Ireland, the North, the UK, the EU, and the US, the case for Irish Unity continues. Two things I never do at the start of a New Year: predictions and resolutions. Resolutions fall by the wayside as old habits regroup. Predictions never fully pan out. The unexpected can and will happen. Choices will have unforeseen consequences. And 2024 will be a year of choices that will define the coming years. This year will likely see general elections in Britain and the South of Ireland. I say likely, as both the British and Irish Governments have home team advantage in terms of setting an election date. Elections must be held before the Spring of 2025. Neither are likely to plan an election in the first months of next year. There are also elections set for June in the South of Ireland for local councils and the EU Parliament. The Irish Government is also planning to hold a referendum to amend an archaic constitutional definition of the role of women in the home. Their replacement wording, which was leaked to the media, has failed to inspire and will no doubt be contested. Under referendum rules, equal time and support have to be given to both sides of the constitutional plebiscite. This is also an election year in the US. By the end of the year, there could be new Irish and British Governments, significant changes in the EU parliament and Commission, and changes in both houses of Congress and the Administration. All of these choices are in the hands of the people. Those choices will have fundamental impacts on Ireland, Anglo-Irish relations, and Irish-American relations as well as the wider European and global community. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The coming Irish general election could be historic. Last time out, Sinn Féin emerged as the largest party. A position that they have consolidated. Until then, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had controlled both government and opposition since the foundation of the state. Following that election, both entered government as part of a coalition with the Green party. Their common policy objective was to keep Sinn Féin out. Mary Lou McDonald became the first woman and the first Sinn Féin president to lead the official opposition. Since then, support for the party has grown. The Sinn Féin president has not hidden the party\'s ambition to lead a government, preferably without Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In doing so, she would become the first woman to be Taoiseach in the first Sinn Féin-led government. It would be an opportunity to break from the past. The party is also confident in gaining ground in the local and European elections in the South. The European parliamentary elections are held on the same week across the member states. There has been a rise of reactionary right-wing parties in Italy, Holland, and Germany. The EU faces continued challenges with the war in Ukraine, a lack of consensus on a ceasefire in the siege of Gaza, and expansion plans with additional states wishing to join. It remains to be seen how these elections will pan out. The parliament and commission are facing significant strategic challenges that will define the EU project for decades to come. One thing is for certain, Britain will not have a say. As a consequence of the choice of Brexit, they have left the Parliament and Commission. The British Labour Party has maintained a significant lead over the governing Tory Party. It has been 12 years since the last Labour Government. Given the extent of the Labour Party\'s lead and the daily scandals and dysfunctions of the current government, it seems that Labour is well-placed to win. This has led to the Labour Leader, Keir Starmer taking conservative and cautious positions on most issues. The party appears to rely on voters\' opposition to the Tories more than articulating what the Labour Party stands for. It remains to be seen what difference a Labour-led government will make with regards to policy in Ireland and the EU. One of the first things to land on the new Prime Minister\'s desk will be defending the current British government\'s Legacy Legislation in the European Court of Human Rights. The outgoing government passed the law that ends police and police ombudsman investigations into actions during the conflict. It blocks the right to inquests and access to the courts for those bereaved. It has been opposed by the victims, all parties in Ireland, and human rights organizations. It was also opposed by the British Labour Party in Westminster. Just before Christmas, the Irish Government initiated an inter-state case against the British Government\'s Legacy law in the European Courts. It is expected that the case will be heard within the next two years. The choice facing Keir Starmer will be to defend in government a law that is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement and that he opposed or stand by his word and revoke the law and return to the existing governmental and cross-party Stormont House Agreement. The election calculations will be playing out within the Democratic Unionist Party. They have seats at Westminster to defend at a time when they block government formation in the North and possible changes of governments in London and Dublin. Despite its grand title, the largest unionist party has a selective approach to democracy. 18 months ago, the vast majority of voters supported a return to government in Stormont. Sinn Féin became the largest party in the jurisdiction and Michelle O’Neill the First Minister-elect. The DUP has refused to respect these results and continues to block the government. It appears that sharing power with an Irish Republican First Minister is a step too far for some elements of their party. The DUP are masters at only making a decision when they absolutely have to; when the alternative to doing nothing comes at a cost to their party. Over the past 18 months, they have been facilitated by the British Government. The cost has been paid by the public, the economy, and confidence in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP has not moved despite a change in presentation. The party made infamous for saying “no” has presented itself over the past 18 months as the party of “no, but maybe."" It is well past decision time for the DUP. The two outgoing governments should now set out how North/South and the devolved institutions will be operated, and the Agreement protected in the absence of the DUP and a functioning Executive. The DUP will do what the DUP will do. It is up to either the outgoing or incoming governments to progress the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Regardless of the election outcomes, the case for Irish Unity continues. The genie is out of the bottle, the debate is now live in homes, academia, and the legal, arts, and business communities. It is an exciting time. A Sinn Féin-led government in Dublin will prepare, plan, and advocate for unity. A Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government may continue to prevaricate. The election outcome may accelerate or slow the progress, but it cannot be stopped. An Irish government planning and preparing for unity is a constitutional and political imperative. Everyone agrees that referendums are coming. The sensible thing to do would be to plan and prepare. An Irish Government leading on the issue would be a game changer north and south, between Britain and Ireland and internationally. Unity referendums, the right of the people who share the island to define their constitutional future, are a foundation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not a point of contention. It is part of the agreement and a settled matter. It binds the British Government to act with rigorous impartiality in the discussion and to act on the outcome of the referendums. The discussions will continue to grow across Ireland and the US. In a world in which the international order has broken down, Ireland and our peace process can continue to act as a beacon of hope. Managing the process of change is a crucial challenge to the incoming governments. Honoring agreements and laws, respecting democracy, and vindicating rights remain the means to assert the primacy of politics over conflict. That has been the lesson of the Irish Peace Process. The current impasse can and will be overcome when governments return to those principles. This year will be a year of choices for people and governments. I cannot predict what the end of the year will look like, but I hope those in power remember the lessons of the past and commit to a better future for all. I am confident that whatever the outcome of the elections in the US, Ireland will continue to have a partner for peace. *Ciarán Quinn is Sinn Fein representative to US.', 'On Irish Border poll, new British Prime Minister is ""committed to the Good Friday Agreement"" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in Belfast that the UK government\'s role in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and an Irish border poll is an ""honest broker."" Keir Starmer addressed the potential of a Border poll while in Northern Ireland on Monday, July 8 as part of a tour of the UK after being elected as the new British Prime Minister last Thursday. “This is provided for by the Good Friday Agreement,” Starmer told reporters at Government Buildings in Belfast on Monday when asked about a potential Border poll. “The framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement. “Today is a recommitment to that and to the approach and the role of the UK government and that is the honest broker. “I am Prime Minister for the whole of the UK, elected into office just a few days ago. “But to reaffirm the importance of the principles of the Good Friday Agreement is part and parcel of why I am here today.” Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Starmer was elected the new British Prime Minister following Thursday\'s General Election across the United Kingdom. His Labour party clinched what is being described as a ""landslide"" victory over Conservatives, who had been in power for more than a decade. In October last year, Starmer said an Irish border poll is ""absolutely hypothetical"" and ""not even on the horizon."" He had previously said that he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK if a referendum is held during his lifetime, stating that he would ""make the case for the United Kingdom."" Starmer\'s comments in October drew some criticism from academics and pro-unity groups in Northern Ireland, but he appeared to offer a more diplomatic response on Monday in Belfast. As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" On Saturday, Northern Ireland\'s new Secretary of State Hillary Benn, also a member of the UK Labour Party, told reporters in Belfast that believes ""there is no evidence that that condition has been met"" to call a border poll, adding that he is ""not going to set out further criteria because there is the one criteria."" Meanwhile, Sinn Féin, Ireland\'s all-island nationalist party that campaigns on Irish unity, emerged as the biggest Northern Ireland party after last week\'s UK General Election. Of the 18 Westminster seats that were up for grabs in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin won the most, seven. The Democratic Unionist Party won five, the SDLP won two, and the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice, and an Independent each won one seat. (Sinn Féin, however, maintains a longstanding policy of not taking their seats in British Parliament, in part because it would require them to swear allegiance to the monarchy.) In its manifesto for the UK General Election, Sinn Féin said in part: ""The Irish and British governments must set a date for a referendum on Irish unity."" On Monday in Belfast, Starmer met with a Sinn Féin delegation that included Michelle O\'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and the vice president of the party, and Mary Lou McDonald, the party\'s president. O\'Neill described Sinn Féin\'s engagements with Starmer on Monday as ""productive."" Our Sinn Féin delegation held a productive meeting with the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer.

Sky News pointed out that McDonald\'s optimism is at odds with Starmer\'s comments last year when he claimed an Irish unity referendum is ""not even on the horizon."" However, after he became British Prime Minister in July, Starmer softened his approach slightly, saying that “the framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement.""

She continued: ""And by the way, this Irish story of finding peace and reunification is great news for all of us. This is right for Ireland, but I would submit right for Britain as well. It\'s right for the British people and the Irish people for us to live not just as good neighbors but I would hope, ultimately, as the very best of friends."" When asked if she expects Starmer to ""promise the world"" in regards to discussions on Irish unity, McDonald replied: ""I\'m not asking for the world.

There has been a rise of reactionary right-wing parties in Italy, Holland, and Germany.

This has led to the Labour Leader, Keir Starmer taking conservative and cautious positions on most issues. The party appears to rely on voters' opposition to the Tories more than articulating what the Labour Party stands for. It remains to be seen what difference a Labour-led government will make with regards to policy in Ireland and the EU. One of the first things to land on the new Prime Minister's desk will be defending the current British government's Legacy Legislation in the European Court of Human Rights. The outgoing government passed the law that ends police and police ombudsman investigations into actions during the conflict. It blocks the right to inquests and access to the courts for those bereaved. It has been opposed by the victims, all parties in Ireland, and human rights organizations. It was also opposed by the British Labour Party in Westminster. Just before Christmas, the Irish Government initiated an inter-state case against the British Government's Legacy law in the European Courts. It is expected that the case will be heard within the next two years. The choice facing Keir Starmer will be to defend in government a law that is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement and that he opposed or stand by his word and revoke the law and return to the existing governmental and cross-party Stormont House Agreement. The election calculations will be playing out within the Democratic Unionist Party. They have seats at Westminster to defend at a time when they block government formation in the North and possible changes of governments in London and Dublin. Despite its grand title, the largest unionist party has a selective approach to democracy. 18 months ago, the vast majority of voters supported a return to government in Stormont. Sinn Féin became the largest party in the jurisdiction and Michelle O’Neill the First Minister-elect. The DUP has refused to respect these results and continues to block the government. It appears that sharing power with an Irish Republican First Minister is a step too far for some elements of their party. The DUP are masters at only making a decision when they absolutely have to; when the alternative to doing nothing comes at a cost to their party. Over the past 18 months, they have been facilitated by the British Government. The cost has been paid by the public, the economy, and confidence in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP has not moved despite a change in presentation. The party made infamous for saying “no” has presented itself over the past 18 months as the party of “no, but maybe."" It is well past decision time for the DUP. The two outgoing governments should now set out how North/South and the devolved institutions will be operated, and the Agreement protected in the absence of the DUP and a functioning Executive. The DUP will do what the DUP will do. It is up to either the outgoing or incoming governments to progress the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Regardless of the election outcomes, the case for Irish Unity continues. The genie is out of the bottle, the debate is now live in homes, academia, and the legal, arts, and business communities. It is an exciting time. A Sinn Féin-led government in Dublin will prepare, plan, and advocate for unity. A Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government may continue to prevaricate. The election outcome may accelerate or slow the progress, but it cannot be stopped. An Irish government planning and preparing for unity is a constitutional and political imperative. Everyone agrees that referendums are coming. The sensible thing to do would be to plan and prepare. An Irish Government leading on the issue would be a game changer north and south, between Britain and Ireland and internationally. Unity referendums, the right of the people who share the island to define their constitutional future, are a foundation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not a point of contention. It is part of the agreement and a settled matter. It binds the British Government to act with rigorous impartiality in the discussion and to act on the outcome of the referendums. The discussions will continue to grow across Ireland and the US. In a world in which the international order has broken down, Ireland and our peace process can continue to act as a beacon of hope. Managing the process of change is a crucial challenge to the incoming governments. Honoring agreements and laws, respecting democracy, and vindicating rights remain the means to assert the primacy of politics over conflict. That has been the lesson of the Irish Peace Process. The current impasse can and will be overcome when governments return to those principles. This year will be a year of choices for people and governments. I cannot predict what the end of the year will look like, but I hope those in power remember the lessons of the past and commit to a better future for all. I am confident that whatever the outcome of the elections in the US, Ireland will continue to have a partner for peace. *Ciarán Quinn is Sinn Fein representative to US.",0,0_northern_agreement_british_friday,"['northern', 'agreement', 'british', 'friday', 'good', 'new', 'minister', 'unity', 'future', 'election']","['United Ireland debate among issues looming large in 2024 Regardless of election outcomes in Ireland, the North, the UK, the EU, and the US, the case for Irish Unity continues.

Keir Starmer addressed the potential of a Border poll while in Northern Ireland on Monday, July 8 as part of a tour of the UK after being elected as the new British Prime Minister last Thursday. “This is provided for by the Good Friday Agreement,” Starmer told reporters at Government Buildings in Belfast on Monday when asked about a potential Border poll. “The framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement. “Today is a recommitment to that and to the approach and the role of the UK government and that is the honest broker. “I am Prime Minister for the whole of the UK, elected into office just a few days ago. “But to reaffirm the importance of the principles of the Good Friday Agreement is part and parcel of why I am here today.” Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Starmer was elected the new British Prime Minister following Thursday\'s General Election across the United Kingdom. His Labour party clinched what is being described as a ""landslide"" victory over Conservatives, who had been in power for more than a decade. In October last year, Starmer said an Irish border poll is ""absolutely hypothetical"" and ""not even on the horizon."" He had previously said that he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK if a referendum is held during his lifetime, stating that he would ""make the case for the United Kingdom."" Starmer\'s comments in October drew some criticism from academics and pro-unity groups in Northern Ireland, but he appeared to offer a more diplomatic response on Monday in Belfast. As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" On Saturday, Northern Ireland\'s new Secretary of State Hillary Benn, also a member of the UK Labour Party, told reporters in Belfast that believes ""there is no evidence that that condition has been met"" to call a border poll, adding that he is ""not going to set out further criteria because there is the one criteria."" Meanwhile, Sinn Féin, Ireland\'s all-island nationalist party that campaigns on Irish unity, emerged as the biggest Northern Ireland party after last week\'s UK General Election. Of the 18 Westminster seats that were up for grabs in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin won the most, seven. The Democratic Unionist Party won five, the SDLP won two, and the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice, and an Independent each won one seat. (Sinn Féin, however, maintains a longstanding policy of not taking their seats in British Parliament, in part because it would require them to swear allegiance to the monarchy.) In its manifesto for the UK General Election, Sinn Féin said in part: ""The Irish and British governments must set a date for a referendum on Irish unity."" On Monday in Belfast, Starmer met with a Sinn Féin delegation that included Michelle O\'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and the vice president of the party, and Mary Lou McDonald, the party\'s president. O\'Neill described Sinn Féin\'s engagements with Starmer on Monday as ""productive."" Our Sinn Féin delegation held a productive meeting with the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer.

Mary Lou McDonald, the President of Sinn Féin, called for “a mature conversation on constitutional change” regarding Irish reunification during her keynote address at Sinn Féin\'s fringe meeting at the British Labour Party Conference in Liverpool on Sunday, September 22. “Part of this new chapter must be the realization that constitutional change in Ireland is coming,"" McDonald said on Sunday. ""I am very aware that this is the subject of genuine conviction and opinions right across Irish society.

The morning after her keynote address, McDonald told Sky News: ""We are hopeful, we anticipate, and we expect that Keir Starmer as Prime Minister that the whole administration will now come behind the Good Friday Agreement in its totality to bring the Irish story, the journey towards peace, to the next destination. ""And, of course, at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, is a provision for referendums to end the partition of our island and, really, to complete the journey to equality and to peace."" McDonald said she hopes Starmer will ""grasp this historic opportunity and I hope he, like I, would wish that when the history books record the Irish history and the final, full resolution of the Irish conflict that it might be a Labour Prime Minister who had the vision and the integrity to take these next steps with us."" Sky News pointed out that McDonald\'s optimism is at odds with Starmer\'s comments last year when he claimed an Irish unity referendum is ""not even on the horizon."" However, after he became British Prime Minister in July, Starmer softened his approach slightly, saying that “the framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement."" McDonald acknowledged on Monday that she is ""forever optimistic,"" but ""not naive."" She said as Prime Minister he, along with the British and Irish governments, are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and that ""you can\'t cherry pick from it."" She said that the obligation to plan for the future and to plan for these referendums runs right alongside the ""working together in the here and now."" She continued: We shouldn\'t stumble into this. ""With all due respect, we watched the manner in which the Brexit debate happened, and to us that was a case study on how not to do it."" McDonald went on to reiterate that she wants ""preparation,"" ""dialogue,"" and ""mature conversation"" amongst the people on the island of Ireland and ""critically, between the Dublin and the London administrations."" She continued: ""And by the way, this Irish story of finding peace and reunification is great news for all of us. This is right for Ireland, but I would submit right for Britain as well. It\'s right for the British people and the Irish people for us to live not just as good neighbors but I would hope, ultimately, as the very best of friends."" When asked if she expects Starmer to ""promise the world"" in regards to discussions on Irish unity, McDonald replied: ""I\'m not asking for the world. ""We as Irish people are not asking for anything more or less than we are legally entitled to and nothing more or less than what\'s contained in the Good Friday Agreement. “I didn’t invent this idea on my way into studio.

One of the first things to land on the new Prime Minister\'s desk will be defending the current British government\'s Legacy Legislation in the European Court of Human Rights. The outgoing government passed the law that ends police and police ombudsman investigations into actions during the conflict. It blocks the right to inquests and access to the courts for those bereaved. It has been opposed by the victims, all parties in Ireland, and human rights organizations. It was also opposed by the British Labour Party in Westminster. Just before Christmas, the Irish Government initiated an inter-state case against the British Government\'s Legacy law in the European Courts. It is expected that the case will be heard within the next two years. The choice facing Keir Starmer will be to defend in government a law that is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement and that he opposed or stand by his word and revoke the law and return to the existing governmental and cross-party Stormont House Agreement. The election calculations will be playing out within the Democratic Unionist Party. They have seats at Westminster to defend at a time when they block government formation in the North and possible changes of governments in London and Dublin. Despite its grand title, the largest unionist party has a selective approach to democracy. 18 months ago, the vast majority of voters supported a return to government in Stormont. Sinn Féin became the largest party in the jurisdiction and Michelle O’Neill the First Minister-elect. The DUP has refused to respect these results and continues to block the government. It appears that sharing power with an Irish Republican First Minister is a step too far for some elements of their party. The DUP are masters at only making a decision when they absolutely have to; when the alternative to doing nothing comes at a cost to their party. Over the past 18 months, they have been facilitated by the British Government. The cost has been paid by the public, the economy, and confidence in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP has not moved despite a change in presentation. The party made infamous for saying “no” has presented itself over the past 18 months as the party of “no, but maybe."" It is well past decision time for the DUP. The two outgoing governments should now set out how North/South and the devolved institutions will be operated, and the Agreement protected in the absence of the DUP and a functioning Executive. The DUP will do what the DUP will do. It is up to either the outgoing or incoming governments to progress the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Regardless of the election outcomes, the case for Irish Unity continues. The genie is out of the bottle, the debate is now live in homes, academia, and the legal, arts, and business communities. It is an exciting time. A Sinn Féin-led government in Dublin will prepare, plan, and advocate for unity. A Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government may continue to prevaricate. The election outcome may accelerate or slow the progress, but it cannot be stopped. An Irish government planning and preparing for unity is a constitutional and political imperative. Everyone agrees that referendums are coming. The sensible thing to do would be to plan and prepare. An Irish Government leading on the issue would be a game changer north and south, between Britain and Ireland and internationally. Unity referendums, the right of the people who share the island to define their constitutional future, are a foundation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not a point of contention. It is part of the agreement and a settled matter. It binds the British Government to act with rigorous impartiality in the discussion and to act on the outcome of the referendums. The discussions will continue to grow across Ireland and the US. In a world in which the international order has broken down, Ireland and our peace process can continue to act as a beacon of hope. Managing the process of change is a crucial challenge to the incoming governments. Honoring agreements and laws, respecting democracy, and vindicating rights remain the means to assert the primacy of politics over conflict. That has been the lesson of the Irish Peace Process. The current impasse can and will be overcome when governments return to those principles. This year will be a year of choices for people and governments. I cannot predict what the end of the year will look like, but I hope those in power remember the lessons of the past and commit to a better future for all. I am confident that whatever the outcome of the elections in the US, Ireland will continue to have a partner for peace. *Ciarán Quinn is Sinn Fein representative to US.', 'On Irish Border poll, new British Prime Minister is ""committed to the Good Friday Agreement"" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in Belfast that the UK government\'s role in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and an Irish border poll is an ""honest broker."" Keir Starmer addressed the potential of a Border poll while in Northern Ireland on Monday, July 8 as part of a tour of the UK after being elected as the new British Prime Minister last Thursday. “This is provided for by the Good Friday Agreement,” Starmer told reporters at Government Buildings in Belfast on Monday when asked about a potential Border poll. “The framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement. “Today is a recommitment to that and to the approach and the role of the UK government and that is the honest broker. “I am Prime Minister for the whole of the UK, elected into office just a few days ago. “But to reaffirm the importance of the principles of the Good Friday Agreement is part and parcel of why I am here today.” Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Starmer was elected the new British Prime Minister following Thursday\'s General Election across the United Kingdom. His Labour party clinched what is being described as a ""landslide"" victory over Conservatives, who had been in power for more than a decade. In October last year, Starmer said an Irish border poll is ""absolutely hypothetical"" and ""not even on the horizon."" He had previously said that he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK if a referendum is held during his lifetime, stating that he would ""make the case for the United Kingdom."" Starmer\'s comments in October drew some criticism from academics and pro-unity groups in Northern Ireland, but he appeared to offer a more diplomatic response on Monday in Belfast. As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" On Saturday, Northern Ireland\'s new Secretary of State Hillary Benn, also a member of the UK Labour Party, told reporters in Belfast that believes ""there is no evidence that that condition has been met"" to call a border poll, adding that he is ""not going to set out further criteria because there is the one criteria."" Meanwhile, Sinn Féin, Ireland\'s all-island nationalist party that campaigns on Irish unity, emerged as the biggest Northern Ireland party after last week\'s UK General Election. Of the 18 Westminster seats that were up for grabs in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin won the most, seven. The Democratic Unionist Party won five, the SDLP won two, and the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice, and an Independent each won one seat. (Sinn Féin, however, maintains a longstanding policy of not taking their seats in British Parliament, in part because it would require them to swear allegiance to the monarchy.) In its manifesto for the UK General Election, Sinn Féin said in part: ""The Irish and British governments must set a date for a referendum on Irish unity."" On Monday in Belfast, Starmer met with a Sinn Féin delegation that included Michelle O\'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and the vice president of the party, and Mary Lou McDonald, the party\'s president. O\'Neill described Sinn Féin\'s engagements with Starmer on Monday as ""productive."" Our Sinn Féin delegation held a productive meeting with the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer.

Mary Lou McDonald, the President of Sinn Féin, called for “a mature conversation on constitutional change” regarding Irish reunification during her keynote address at Sinn Féin\'s fringe meeting at the British Labour Party Conference in Liverpool on Sunday, September 22. “Part of this new chapter must be the realization that constitutional change in Ireland is coming,"" McDonald said on Sunday.

The morning after her keynote address, McDonald told Sky News: ""We are hopeful, we anticipate, and we expect that Keir Starmer as Prime Minister that the whole administration will now come behind the Good Friday Agreement in its totality to bring the Irish story, the journey towards peace, to the next destination. ""And, of course, at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, is a provision for referendums to end the partition of our island and, really, to complete the journey to equality and to peace."" McDonald said she hopes Starmer will ""grasp this historic opportunity and I hope he, like I, would wish that when the history books record the Irish history and the final, full resolution of the Irish conflict that it might be a Labour Prime Minister who had the vision and the integrity to take these next steps with us."" Sky News pointed out that McDonald\'s optimism is at odds with Starmer\'s comments last year when he claimed an Irish unity referendum is ""not even on the horizon."" However, after he became British Prime Minister in July, Starmer softened his approach slightly, saying that “the framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement."" McDonald acknowledged on Monday that she is ""forever optimistic,"" but ""not naive."" She said as Prime Minister he, along with the British and Irish governments, are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and that ""you can\'t cherry pick from it."" She said that the obligation to plan for the future and to plan for these referendums runs right alongside the ""working together in the here and now."" She continued: We shouldn\'t stumble into this. ""With all due respect, we watched the manner in which the Brexit debate happened, and to us that was a case study on how not to do it."" McDonald went on to reiterate that she wants ""preparation,"" ""dialogue,"" and ""mature conversation"" amongst the people on the island of Ireland and ""critically, between the Dublin and the London administrations."" She continued: ""And by the way, this Irish story of finding peace and reunification is great news for all of us. This is right for Ireland, but I would submit right for Britain as well. It\'s right for the British people and the Irish people for us to live not just as good neighbors but I would hope, ultimately, as the very best of friends."" When asked if she expects Starmer to ""promise the world"" in regards to discussions on Irish unity, McDonald replied: ""I\'m not asking for the world. ""We as Irish people are not asking for anything more or less than we are legally entitled to and nothing more or less than what\'s contained in the Good Friday Agreement. “I didn’t invent this idea on my way into studio. This is a long-standing provision of an Agreement that is now 26 years old. “And what I am saying I suppose, in summary, is that all parties to the Agreement now need to recognize the depth of change that is happening in Ireland. “The Unionist majority in the North of Ireland, the electoral majority, is gone. It’s not coming back. “We live in the now and we have to plan for the future. “I am asking for, and we are promoting, dialogue, inclusion amongst all stakeholders of all perspectives. “But there has to be clarity from the British government - and, by the way, the government in Dublin - that the referendum provisions of the Good Friday Agreement were not drafted to lie dormant but will, in fact, be enacted and that the people ultimately will have our say and decide our future together democratically and peacefully and in a spirit of respect, cooperation, and indeed friendship with Britain."" As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" McDonald noted while on Sky News that for the first time ever, Sinn Féin is the largest party in Northern Ireland and holds the office of First Minister. Despite this, opinion polls have not found overwhelming support for a border poll. In February, a LucidTalk poll for the Belfast Telegraph found that 49% of respondents in Northern Ireland would vote to remain in the UK if a border poll was held within a week, while 39% would vote to leave the UK and join Ireland. However, in Ireland, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement said in July that preparation for referenda on Irish unification will be ""a historic task"" and called for ""preparation to begin immediately.""']",northern - agreement - british - friday - good - new - minister - unity - future - election,1.0,False
"Galway farmer convicted after flinging cow dung at politician Galway farmer Joseph Baldwin claimed in court he had ""no intention to harm anyone"" when he flung cow dung during a community meeting. Joseph Baldwin, a farmer based in Gort, Co Galway, has been convicted after throwing a bag of cow dung at TD Anne Rabbitte during a local community meeting in January 2023. Baldwin, who denied the charges against him, was convicted of assault as well as a breach of the peace by engaging in threatening or abusive behavior on the night of the incident. Baldwin's sentencing has been adjourned until December 18 to allow the preparation of a probation report. Speaking after the conviction was handed down in Ennis District Court on Wednesday, October 2, Rabbitte said: “There was a line, the line was crossed, and that was acknowledged today in the courtroom.” FF TD & Minister Anne Rabbitte says “the line was crossed” in terms of acceptable protest as #Galway farmer Joseph Baldwin is convicted of Assaulting her by throwing bag of Cow Dung at #Gort Biogas meeting - I’ll have full details @drivetimerte @RTERadio1 pic.twitter.com/IKipnW0kzK Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! On January 4, 2023, Rabbitte took to Twitter, now X, to say that a ""bag of sh.t"" had been thrown at her and a government colleague during a meeting. The colleague was TD Ciarán Cannon, who afterward told RTÉ News: ""One gentleman at the very beginning of the meeting took it upon himself to launch into a tirade essentially accusing Minister Anne Rabbitte and I of being culpable in granting this planning permission and then proceeded to take two bags, of what I now know to be cow dung, out from his pocket, walked over to me, threw one at me and then as he returned to his place in the room, he threw the other at Minister Anne Rabbitte. ""And then he left the meeting and returned shortly thereafter to stand in quite close proximity to Minister Rabbitte for the remainder of the meeting."" Cannon added: ""While last night wasn't a particular serious incident, it is part of a cumulative chipping away at our democracy."" After the incident, Irish politicians reportedly received a crime-prevention information sheet from gardaí encouraging them to be ""street-wise"" and to wear comfortable shoes so they can move quickly if the need arises. According to the Irish Examiner, Baldwin, who was charged in November 2023, said in court that on the day of the incident, “I went down to the farmyard and put dry cow dung into ziplock bags. There was no smell or odour off the bags and I made sure that they were secure. “They were very light — like a featherweight. I thought all the TDs and councillors would be at the top table where I could leave the bags in front of them.” He added: ”On the evening in question, I said to myself, ‘I have had enough’, something had to be done for them to listen and show them that it was unacceptable for the community to be treated like this. “I went to that meeting with no intention to harm anyone. In my own mind, I thought that it might be a way of getting through to two Government TDs that they were clearly not helping or listening to the people of our own community. “I am not apologising because I believe that all I was doing was making the views of the community known and I didn’t hurt anybody in the process. ""I am just a normal, decent person thinking about my community and the people who live in it."" RTÉ News reports that CCTV footage, shown to the court on September 13, shows Baldwin flinging a bag of animal excrement at Cannon, which landed at his feet and did not hit him. Baldwin then Rabbitte: ""There's one for you too."" However, the bag he flung at her missed hitting her.

Richard McGreevy, 28, has been charged in connection with an online video that contained threats to kill Sinn Féin President TD Mary Lou McDonald. McGreevy, with an address at Whitechurch Place, Rathfarnham, Co Dublin, appeared before the Dublin District Court this morning, July 19. An Garda Siochana announced on Thursday night that the man who was arrested at a residence in South Dublin earlier that day as part of an investigation into threats made online against a public representative and a Senior Garda Officer had been charged.

The individual said he would shoot me dead,” McDonald said on social media on Wednesday. “This represents an escalation of targeted online abuse directed at me over the last year. It is totally unacceptable. “I have reported this to An Garda Síochána. “Ironically, this threat was made while I was hosting a discussion on the need for zero tolerance when it comes to violence against women and girls.” Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, McDonald further said the campaign against her has been “vicious, it has been sexist, misogynistic, it has been racist, and it’s also politically contrived to cause a problem between me and the working class communities that we represent.” McDonald said she is “satisfied” that Gardai are going to handle the threat. “But this cannot stand. It cannot stand that on any social media platform or anywhere else that somebody can brazenly come forward and threaten to take your life and somehow imagine that that is acceptable or okay or part of a political conversation. It’s not.” She added: “I’m no shrinking violet. I’m not a bit precious about people making all manner of commentary, but I’m drawing the line. I’ve had enough of it, quite frankly.” While she admitted she is “upset” about the threat, McDonald said: “It’s clearly not going to put me off doing my job and carrying out my democratic function and representing people to the best of my ability.” This death threat is an escalation in a vicious, sexist, misogynistic, racist campaign against me that has been ongoing for over a year and that has been politically contrived to cause problems between me and the working class communities we in Sinn Féin represent.

The video has since been shared by various other accounts on different platforms. Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast on Thursday morning, the day after she publicly condemned the video, McDonald said the threat against her “speaks to something much wider in our society, and is frightening.” The Sinn Féin leader said that in her role, she understands that she is susceptible to commentary and criticism, but that “every line has been now crossed” with this week\'s online threat. “This is just the latest escalation in something that I think is really dangerous, generally, and that I know has been very deliberately targeted at me, and I’m sick of it. “I hadn’t said much publicly throughout this year about what was going on, but once there is a direct threat made - openly, brazenly broadcast on social media - that a person will shoot you, that they will take your life, and that they feel comfortable saying that, broadcasting it, and announcing it to the world, clearly that puts you in the way of greater danger, and I found that frightening.” McDonald said she chose to speak out after the threat in terms of her “own personal security"" and also because “it is not on.” “It’s me this time,"" McDonald said. ""It could be anybody else. ""It is not acceptable in our society that people feel at liberty to throw their weight around like that and threaten to kill democratically elected politicians - or, by the way, anybody else.” McDonald, who noted that the matter was being investigated by Gardaí, said that “there have to be consequences for these kind of actions,” adding that “it’s not because I’m some sort of special category of person. I’m an equal citizen in this society and my safety is on an equal par with everybody else\'s.” Regarding the person who made the online threat, McDonald said: “The person who issued this threat against me spoke also about the issues around immigration and protest. He is part of that small section of Irish society that has chosen to be toxic and violent and disorderly and hateful, and they have to be faced down. “And, at the same time, the wider section of many communities who are not racist and hateful and all of those things but who are concerned and have not been engaged properly, who don’t have confidence in the way in which immigration, in particular, is being managed at this time - we need to engage that section of the population and talk and listen, and listen and talk, and lead.” McDonald went on to say that the TikTok video with the threat against her and Harris should not have been permitted to remain live for so long. After the arrest, RTÉ News reported on Thursday the video which was originally posted on TikTok has now been taken down from that platform but remains in circulation on Facebook and X. TikTok said on Thursday afternoon that the video violated its community guidelines which prohibit violent threats and incitement. It also said the content had been removed from its platform and the account banned. Meta also claimed the video had been removed from Facebook, but RTÉ reported that they were still able to access it through the site and it is also widely available on other social media platforms. IrishCentral was also easily able to find the video on X and Facebook on Thursday afternoon, though it had been shared by accounts slamming the man and his threats. RTÉ News added that neither TikTok nor Meta would say how long the video was on their platforms, why it was not taken down immediately, if they were cooperating with the garda investigation, or whether their content moderation and security procedures have proven to be extremely weak in this case. Both social media companies claim they do not allow violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities but gardaí say criminal gangs use these social media platforms for organised crime activity.']",garda - man - video - dublin - drew - abuse - sexual - inquiry - mcgreevy - threat,1.0,False

Ireland\'s Minister for Justice Helen McEntee TD secured Government approval on Tuesday, April 16 to recommend to President Higgins to grant a posthumous presidential pardon to Sylvester Poff and James Barrett. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Thomas Browne in October 1882 and were both executed in January 1883. Ireland\'s Department of Justice said on Tuesday that given a number of factors in this case, and based upon the detailed Report received from Dr. Niamh Howlin, Minister McEntee and her government colleagues decided to recommend to the President that he exercise his right to pardon, contained in Article 13.6 of the Constitution on the grounds their convictions were unsafe. The granting of a Presidential Pardon is a right which should be offered only in the most deserving of circumstances, the Department noted. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Minister McEntee said on Tuesday: “This is a very rare occurrence and a very high bar must be reached for the Government to recommend to the president that he exercise this right. “Having considered the findings in Dr Howlin’s report, the trial, conviction, and execution of Mr. Poff and Mr. Barrett were unfair by the standards of the time. “Both men were wrongfully convicted and suffered the harshest penalty under the law of the time in what can now be attributed to a miscarriage of justice. “I would like to acknowledge the work done by the Castleisland District Heritage Inc. Michael O’Donohue Memorial Project in bringing this case to my Department.” Johnnie Roche, Chairman of Castleisland District Heritage, shakes hands with Tomo Burke, great grandson of Sylvester... The 1880s in Ireland brought frequent agitation for land reform, which often developed into agrarian violence, with outrages pertaining to matters such as landlords, evictions, rent strikes, and boycotts, known as the Land War. In May 1882, the murders of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Chief Secretary, and his Under Secretary, T.H. Burke were carried out in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Referred to as the Phoenix Park Murders, they were the catalyst for the legislative response to the growing agrarian unrest. The Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Act 1882 (1882 Act) was a piece of coercive legislation passed in July 1882 in the aftermath of the Phoenix Park murders to clamp down on crimes such as “treason, murder, arson, attacks on dwelling-houses and crimes of aggravated violence.” Co Kerry and the area around Castleisland in particular, was experiencing a great deal of unrest and violence during this period. On October 3, 1882, Thomas Browne was murdered while working in one of his fields in Dromulton, near Scartaglin in Co Kerry. Two men in dark coats, seen from behind, shot him several times. Sylvester Poff and James Barrett, who did not match the descriptions of the assailants, were known to be in the vicinity at the time. The two men were arrested following a statement by a neighbour that they had seen them enter the field where Browne was shot. The prosecution case largely rested on the evidence of a neighbour, whose story changed as the case progressed and who could not be regarded as a reliable witness. Poff and Barrett were tried twice before special juries in Cork for the murder of Browne after the jury in the first trial failed to reach agreement on a verdict. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Browne in December 1882 and, despite petitions for mercy to the Lord Lieutenant, they were hanged in Tralee Gaol in January 1883. Dr. Niamh Howlin, an expert in 19th Century trial law and an Associate Professor in the Sutherland School of Law, UCD, was engaged by the Department of Justice to undertake an independent external review of the case and to advise upon the safety of the conviction or otherwise, with clear reference to the prevailing standards at the time. Dr. Howlin\'s examination concluded that a number of factors, including in the investigation and procedures around the trial, led her to form the opinion that Poff\'s and Barrett\'s convictions were unsafe. These factors included: a ‘packed jury,\' evidential deficiencies (including conflicting witness testimony), no motive, and that other lines of enquiry appear to have been neglected during the investigation and trial. In addition, the report found that there was no direct evidence against Poff and Barrett, with the case resting on the circumstantial and contradictory evidence of one witness. Dr Howlin concluded her report by stating: ""A twenty-first century criminal court would not convict Poff and Barrett on the basis of the evidence which was presented by the Crown in 1882. The convictions were also inconsistent with the legal standards of the period. “They were convicted on the basis of evidence which was both circumstantial and weak. The trials and conviction of Poff and Barrett included legal and procedural deficiencies which were ‘so inconsistent with the legal standards of the period and so objectively unsatisfactory and unfair, that they render the conviction unsafe.” This is the fourth occasion that a posthumous Presidential Pardon could be awarded. The first posthumous Presidential Pardon was awarded by President Higgins to Harry Gleeson in 2015. The second posthumous Presidential Pardon, and the first to be granted for events which occurred prior to the formation of the State, was granted to Myles Joyce in April 2018, who was executed having been found guilty of involvement in the Maamtrasna murders in 1882. The third posthumous pardon was awarded to John Twiss in 2021. The threshold to recommend a Presidential Pardon is high and, since 1937, only seven Presidential Pardons have been awarded.', 'Thousands receive Irish citizenship as part of ""wonderful celebration"" in Killarney More than 100 people from the US were among the thousands who received Irish citizenship during ceremonies in Killarney this week. 4,800 people were granted Irish citizenship in six ceremonies which took place on Monday, June 10 and Tuesday, June 11 at the INEC Killarney in Co Kerry.

"Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald wants ‘clarity’ on McGregor DPP decision Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has called on the DPP to provide a statement on why it was decided not to prosecute Conor McGregor. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has called on the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to explain why it was decided not to prosecute Conor McGregor. Referring to Nikita Hand’s victory in her civil case against the MMA fighter, Mary Lou McDonald said the women of Ireland have to know that ""when a violent rape is carried out… that the system takes that really seriously"". CSO figures published this week showed that just one in every five sexual assault cases reported to gardaí resulted in a prosecution. Last week, the High Court ruled in favor of Ms Hand, who accused McGregor of raping her in a Dublin hotel in December 2018, with McGregor ordered to pay €240,000 in damages. Public scrutiny has since turned to the office of the DPP which, in 2020, told Hand there was ""insufficient evidence"" to bring a criminal case. McDonald on Thursday urged the DPP to make a statement on the matter, saying women must know rape is a ""very, very serious crime"". She said: ""We’ve had incidents like this before where the DPP hasn’t brought a case, and it’s caused real anxiety. I think there needs to be real clarity as to why that decision was taken."" * This article was originally published on Extra.ie.",1,1_garda_man_video_dublin,"['garda', 'man', 'video', 'dublin', 'drew', 'abuse', 'sexual', 'inquiry', 'mcgreevy', 'threat']","['""I didn’t mean it to go so viral"" - Dublin man charged with threatening to kill Mary Lou McDonald Dublin man Richard McGreevy is accused of making threats to kill or cause serious harm to TD Mary Lou McDonald. Richard McGreevy, 28, has been charged in connection with an online video that contained threats to kill Sinn Féin President TD Mary Lou McDonald. McGreevy, with an address at Whitechurch Place, Rathfarnham, Co Dublin, appeared before the Dublin District Court this morning, July 19. An Garda Siochana announced on Thursday night that the man who was arrested at a residence in South Dublin earlier that day as part of an investigation into threats made online against a public representative and a Senior Garda Officer had been charged. McGreevy was charged under Section 5 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997; he is accused of making threats to kill or cause serious harm to McDonald.

At that point, McGreevy spoke up and addressed the judge: ""I was angry that day, I was so angry that day, I’ve already explained this. ""I put that up; I didn’t mean it to go so viral.""

Legal aid was granted to McGreevy, who was not granted bail and was remanded in custody pending directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions. He will have his next hearing on July 26 at Cloverhill District Court. The charge comes on the foot of a complaint lodged by McDonald on Wednesday after the video allegedly filmed by McGreevy circulated online.

TD Mary Lou McDonald, the President of Sinn Féin and leader of Ireland’s opposition party, has spoken out about a death threat that was made against her online yesterday, July 16. “Last night a threat to kill me was issued online. The individual said he would shoot me dead,” McDonald said on social media on Wednesday. “This represents an escalation of targeted online abuse directed at me over the last year. It is totally unacceptable. “I have reported this to An Garda Síochána. “Ironically, this threat was made while I was hosting a discussion on the need for zero tolerance when it comes to violence against women and girls.” Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, McDonald further said the campaign against her has been “vicious, it has been sexist, misogynistic, it has been racist, and it’s also politically contrived to cause a problem between me and the working class communities that we represent.” McDonald said she is “satisfied” that Gardai are going to handle the threat. “But this cannot stand. It cannot stand that on any social media platform or anywhere else that somebody can brazenly come forward and threaten to take your life and somehow imagine that that is acceptable or okay or part of a political conversation. It’s not.” She added: “I’m no shrinking violet. I’m not a bit precious about people making all manner of commentary, but I’m drawing the line. I’ve had enough of it, quite frankly.” While she admitted she is “upset” about the threat, McDonald said: “It’s clearly not going to put me off doing my job and carrying out my democratic function and representing people to the best of my ability.” This death threat is an escalation in a vicious, sexist, misogynistic, racist campaign against me that has been ongoing for over a year and that has been politically contrived to cause problems between me and the working class communities we in Sinn Féin represent.

""It could be anybody else. ""It is not acceptable in our society that people feel at liberty to throw their weight around like that and threaten to kill democratically elected politicians - or, by the way, anybody else.” McDonald, who noted that the matter was being investigated by Gardaí, said that “there have to be consequences for these kind of actions,” adding that “it’s not because I’m some sort of special category of person. I’m an equal citizen in this society and my safety is on an equal par with everybody else\'s.” Regarding the person who made the online threat, McDonald said: “The person who issued this threat against me spoke also about the issues around immigration and protest. He is part of that small section of Irish society that has chosen to be toxic and violent and disorderly and hateful, and they have to be faced down. “And, at the same time, the wider section of many communities who are not racist and hateful and all of those things but who are concerned and have not been engaged properly, who don’t have confidence in the way in which immigration, in particular, is being managed at this time - we need to engage that section of the population and talk and listen, and listen and talk, and lead.” McDonald went on to say that the TikTok video with the threat against her and Harris should not have been permitted to remain live for so long. After the arrest, RTÉ News reported on Thursday the video which was originally posted on TikTok has now been taken down from that platform but remains in circulation on Facebook and X. TikTok said on Thursday afternoon that the video violated its community guidelines which prohibit violent threats and incitement. It also said the content had been removed from its platform and the account banned. Meta also claimed the video had been removed from Facebook, but RTÉ reported that they were still able to access it through the site and it is also widely available on other social media platforms. IrishCentral was also easily able to find the video on X and Facebook on Thursday afternoon, though it had been shared by accounts slamming the man and his threats. RTÉ News added that neither TikTok nor Meta would say how long the video was on their platforms, why it was not taken down immediately, if they were cooperating with the garda investigation, or whether their content moderation and security procedures have proven to be extremely weak in this case. Both social media companies claim they do not allow violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities but gardaí say criminal gangs use these social media platforms for organised crime activity.']",garda - man - video - dublin - drew - abuse - sexual - inquiry - mcgreevy - threat,0.7619895050751,False

Ireland\'s Minister for Justice Helen McEntee TD secured Government approval on Tuesday, April 16 to recommend to President Higgins to grant a posthumous presidential pardon to Sylvester Poff and James Barrett. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Thomas Browne in October 1882 and were both executed in January 1883. Ireland\'s Department of Justice said on Tuesday that given a number of factors in this case, and based upon the detailed Report received from Dr. Niamh Howlin, Minister McEntee and her government colleagues decided to recommend to the President that he exercise his right to pardon, contained in Article 13.6 of the Constitution on the grounds their convictions were unsafe. The granting of a Presidential Pardon is a right which should be offered only in the most deserving of circumstances, the Department noted. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Minister McEntee said on Tuesday: “This is a very rare occurrence and a very high bar must be reached for the Government to recommend to the president that he exercise this right. “Having considered the findings in Dr Howlin’s report, the trial, conviction, and execution of Mr. Poff and Mr. Barrett were unfair by the standards of the time. “Both men were wrongfully convicted and suffered the harshest penalty under the law of the time in what can now be attributed to a miscarriage of justice. “I would like to acknowledge the work done by the Castleisland District Heritage Inc. Michael O’Donohue Memorial Project in bringing this case to my Department.” Johnnie Roche, Chairman of Castleisland District Heritage, shakes hands with Tomo Burke, great grandson of Sylvester... The 1880s in Ireland brought frequent agitation for land reform, which often developed into agrarian violence, with outrages pertaining to matters such as landlords, evictions, rent strikes, and boycotts, known as the Land War. In May 1882, the murders of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Chief Secretary, and his Under Secretary, T.H. Burke were carried out in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Referred to as the Phoenix Park Murders, they were the catalyst for the legislative response to the growing agrarian unrest. The Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Act 1882 (1882 Act) was a piece of coercive legislation passed in July 1882 in the aftermath of the Phoenix Park murders to clamp down on crimes such as “treason, murder, arson, attacks on dwelling-houses and crimes of aggravated violence.” Co Kerry and the area around Castleisland in particular, was experiencing a great deal of unrest and violence during this period. On October 3, 1882, Thomas Browne was murdered while working in one of his fields in Dromulton, near Scartaglin in Co Kerry. Two men in dark coats, seen from behind, shot him several times. Sylvester Poff and James Barrett, who did not match the descriptions of the assailants, were known to be in the vicinity at the time. The two men were arrested following a statement by a neighbour that they had seen them enter the field where Browne was shot. The prosecution case largely rested on the evidence of a neighbour, whose story changed as the case progressed and who could not be regarded as a reliable witness. Poff and Barrett were tried twice before special juries in Cork for the murder of Browne after the jury in the first trial failed to reach agreement on a verdict. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Browne in December 1882 and, despite petitions for mercy to the Lord Lieutenant, they were hanged in Tralee Gaol in January 1883. Dr. Niamh Howlin, an expert in 19th Century trial law and an Associate Professor in the Sutherland School of Law, UCD, was engaged by the Department of Justice to undertake an independent external review of the case and to advise upon the safety of the conviction or otherwise, with clear reference to the prevailing standards at the time. Dr. Howlin\'s examination concluded that a number of factors, including in the investigation and procedures around the trial, led her to form the opinion that Poff\'s and Barrett\'s convictions were unsafe. These factors included: a ‘packed jury,\' evidential deficiencies (including conflicting witness testimony), no motive, and that other lines of enquiry appear to have been neglected during the investigation and trial. In addition, the report found that there was no direct evidence against Poff and Barrett, with the case resting on the circumstantial and contradictory evidence of one witness. Dr Howlin concluded her report by stating: ""A twenty-first century criminal court would not convict Poff and Barrett on the basis of the evidence which was presented by the Crown in 1882. The convictions were also inconsistent with the legal standards of the period. “They were convicted on the basis of evidence which was both circumstantial and weak. The trials and conviction of Poff and Barrett included legal and procedural deficiencies which were ‘so inconsistent with the legal standards of the period and so objectively unsatisfactory and unfair, that they render the conviction unsafe.” This is the fourth occasion that a posthumous Presidential Pardon could be awarded. The first posthumous Presidential Pardon was awarded by President Higgins to Harry Gleeson in 2015. The second posthumous Presidential Pardon, and the first to be granted for events which occurred prior to the formation of the State, was granted to Myles Joyce in April 2018, who was executed having been found guilty of involvement in the Maamtrasna murders in 1882. The third posthumous pardon was awarded to John Twiss in 2021.

"Mary Lou McDonald believes Irish unity referendum will take place by 2030 McDonald was speaking at the Irish Unity Summit in the Great Hall of New York's Cooper Union on Friday. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has said that she believes an Irish unity referendum will take place before the end of the decade, stating that she believes Ireland and Northern Ireland will be united within her lifetime. McDonald was speaking at the Irish Unity Summit in the Great Hall of New York's Cooper Union on Friday. The event, which was organized by a number of Irish-American organizations, featured presentations, panel discussions, and speeches about the next steps on the potential united Ireland. Standing on the same stage once used by Abraham Lincoln and James Connolly, McDonald said the Irish and British Governments must ""face up to the reality that a momentous current of change is pulsing throughout Ireland"". Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! ""A new chapter of Irish history is being written. Change is real and happening in real-time,"" McDonald told the audience on Friday. ""For the first time ever, we have a nationalist leading government in the north of Ireland in a state designed and engineered to ensure that this could never happen. A state designed and engineered to ensure a permanent unionist majority,"" McDonald said. ""That is now gone. Sinn Féin leads the executive and local government. Combined nationalism outpulls combined unionism."" McDonald added that the partition of Ireland in 1921 has ""failed since the start"", adding that there has been a ""profound"" political, economical, and social cost to partition. ""The policies implemented by the Tory government over the last decade have spelt disaster for the North, for nationalists and unionists alike. Tory austerity has ravaged vital public services and it's damaged the lives of workers. ""Tory governments in London never cared for the people of the North of Ireland."" In the event of a united Ireland, McDonald said she would treat anyone who identifies as a unionist as an equal. ""I see every person who argues for the preservation of the union with Britain, every person of British identity as an equal,"" McDonald said. ""No caveats, no exceptions. All equal. ""To those citizens of a unionist or British tradition, I say, we seek a future of partnership, equality, and progress. The New Ireland we seek belongs every bit as much to the families of the Shankill as the families of the Falls. Every bit as much to the families of Ballymena as it does to the families of Ballymun."" McDonald pointed to a recent report published by civic organization Ireland's Future, which includes proposals for a unity referendum by the end of the decade. ""I believe that that is the timeline. I believe that that is achievable. More and more people are now seriously considering the future and the shape of constitutional change."" As per the Good Friday Agreement, only the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland can call a referendum on Irish unity. The landmark agreement states that Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom until a majority of people in Ireland and Northern Ireland choose otherwise. McDonald also said a general election is approaching in Ireland and added that Sinn Féin will put ""reunification at the very heart of our agenda"" if the party forms a government. She pointed to the success of the Good Friday Agreement in establishing peace on the island of Ireland in 1998 and said the agreement empowered the citizens of Ireland to decide their own future. She also said the success of the Good Friday Agreement proves that peace is attainable in Gaza, drawing widespread applause from the audience. ""The success of the Good Friday Agreement teaches us that no conflict is intractable,"" McDonald said. ""We need to fuel a peace process based on international law. Based on the two-state solution, with the aim of achieving self-determination and freedom for the Palestinians and a secure Israel. Because you see, even in the darkest of times, we must seek the light. We must bring the light."" Earlier in the day, New York Governor Kathy Hochul addressed the summit and said that the Good Friday Agreement must be protected at all costs. ""It is now upon all of us, whether you're Irish Americans, Irish New Yorkers, or direct from the Emerald Isle, to uphold this peace, this unique time in our history, where people can come together and put aside their differences and say that we want the violence to end,"" Hochul told the Summit. ""Let what happened with the Good Friday Agreement - and its endurance over the last 26 years - give hope to other parts of our world that are in conflict today.

Two things I never do at the start of a New Year: predictions and resolutions. Resolutions fall by the wayside as old habits regroup. Predictions never fully pan out. The unexpected can and will happen. Choices will have unforeseen consequences. And 2024 will be a year of choices that will define the coming years. This year will likely see general elections in Britain and the South of Ireland. I say likely, as both the British and Irish Governments have home team advantage in terms of setting an election date. Elections must be held before the Spring of 2025. Neither are likely to plan an election in the first months of next year. There are also elections set for June in the South of Ireland for local councils and the EU Parliament. The Irish Government is also planning to hold a referendum to amend an archaic constitutional definition of the role of women in the home. Their replacement wording, which was leaked to the media, has failed to inspire and will no doubt be contested. Under referendum rules, equal time and support have to be given to both sides of the constitutional plebiscite. This is also an election year in the US. By the end of the year, there could be new Irish and British Governments, significant changes in the EU parliament and Commission, and changes in both houses of Congress and the Administration. All of these choices are in the hands of the people. Those choices will have fundamental impacts on Ireland, Anglo-Irish relations, and Irish-American relations as well as the wider European and global community. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The coming Irish general election could be historic. Last time out, Sinn Féin emerged as the largest party. A position that they have consolidated. Until then, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had controlled both government and opposition since the foundation of the state. Following that election, both entered government as part of a coalition with the Green party. Their common policy objective was to keep Sinn Féin out. Mary Lou McDonald became the first woman and the first Sinn Féin president to lead the official opposition. Since then, support for the party has grown. The Sinn Féin president has not hidden the party\'s ambition to lead a government, preferably without Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In doing so, she would become the first woman to be Taoiseach in the first Sinn Féin-led government. It would be an opportunity to break from the past. The party is also confident in gaining ground in the local and European elections in the South. The European parliamentary elections are held on the same week across the member states. There has been a rise of reactionary right-wing parties in Italy, Holland, and Germany. The EU faces continued challenges with the war in Ukraine, a lack of consensus on a ceasefire in the siege of Gaza, and expansion plans with additional states wishing to join. It remains to be seen how these elections will pan out. The parliament and commission are facing significant strategic challenges that will define the EU project for decades to come. One thing is for certain, Britain will not have a say. As a consequence of the choice of Brexit, they have left the Parliament and Commission. The British Labour Party has maintained a significant lead over the governing Tory Party. It has been 12 years since the last Labour Government. Given the extent of the Labour Party\'s lead and the daily scandals and dysfunctions of the current government, it seems that Labour is well-placed to win. This has led to the Labour Leader, Keir Starmer taking conservative and cautious positions on most issues. The party appears to rely on voters\' opposition to the Tories more than articulating what the Labour Party stands for. It remains to be seen what difference a Labour-led government will make with regards to policy in Ireland and the EU. One of the first things to land on the new Prime Minister\'s desk will be defending the current British government\'s Legacy Legislation in the European Court of Human Rights. The outgoing government passed the law that ends police and police ombudsman investigations into actions during the conflict. It blocks the right to inquests and access to the courts for those bereaved. It has been opposed by the victims, all parties in Ireland, and human rights organizations. It was also opposed by the British Labour Party in Westminster. Just before Christmas, the Irish Government initiated an inter-state case against the British Government\'s Legacy law in the European Courts. It is expected that the case will be heard within the next two years. The choice facing Keir Starmer will be to defend in government a law that is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement and that he opposed or stand by his word and revoke the law and return to the existing governmental and cross-party Stormont House Agreement. The election calculations will be playing out within the Democratic Unionist Party. They have seats at Westminster to defend at a time when they block government formation in the North and possible changes of governments in London and Dublin. Despite its grand title, the largest unionist party has a selective approach to democracy. 18 months ago, the vast majority of voters supported a return to government in Stormont. Sinn Féin became the largest party in the jurisdiction and Michelle O’Neill the First Minister-elect. The DUP has refused to respect these results and continues to block the government. It appears that sharing power with an Irish Republican First Minister is a step too far for some elements of their party. The DUP are masters at only making a decision when they absolutely have to; when the alternative to doing nothing comes at a cost to their party. Over the past 18 months, they have been facilitated by the British Government. The cost has been paid by the public, the economy, and confidence in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP has not moved despite a change in presentation. The party made infamous for saying “no” has presented itself over the past 18 months as the party of “no, but maybe."" It is well past decision time for the DUP. The two outgoing governments should now set out how North/South and the devolved institutions will be operated, and the Agreement protected in the absence of the DUP and a functioning Executive. The DUP will do what the DUP will do. It is up to either the outgoing or incoming governments to progress the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Regardless of the election outcomes, the case for Irish Unity continues. The genie is out of the bottle, the debate is now live in homes, academia, and the legal, arts, and business communities. It is an exciting time. A Sinn Féin-led government in Dublin will prepare, plan, and advocate for unity. A Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government may continue to prevaricate. The election outcome may accelerate or slow the progress, but it cannot be stopped. An Irish government planning and preparing for unity is a constitutional and political imperative. Everyone agrees that referendums are coming. The sensible thing to do would be to plan and prepare. An Irish Government leading on the issue would be a game changer north and south, between Britain and Ireland and internationally. Unity referendums, the right of the people who share the island to define their constitutional future, are a foundation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not a point of contention. It is part of the agreement and a settled matter. It binds the British Government to act with rigorous impartiality in the discussion and to act on the outcome of the referendums. The discussions will continue to grow across Ireland and the US. In a world in which the international order has broken down, Ireland and our peace process can continue to act as a beacon of hope. Managing the process of change is a crucial challenge to the incoming governments. Honoring agreements and laws, respecting democracy, and vindicating rights remain the means to assert the primacy of politics over conflict. That has been the lesson of the Irish Peace Process. The current impasse can and will be overcome when governments return to those principles. This year will be a year of choices for people and governments. I cannot predict what the end of the year will look like, but I hope those in power remember the lessons of the past and commit to a better future for all. I am confident that whatever the outcome of the elections in the US, Ireland will continue to have a partner for peace. *Ciarán Quinn is Sinn Fein representative to US.', 'On Irish Border poll, new British Prime Minister is ""committed to the Good Friday Agreement"" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in Belfast that the UK government\'s role in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and an Irish border poll is an ""honest broker."" Keir Starmer addressed the potential of a Border poll while in Northern Ireland on Monday, July 8 as part of a tour of the UK after being elected as the new British Prime Minister last Thursday. “This is provided for by the Good Friday Agreement,” Starmer told reporters at Government Buildings in Belfast on Monday when asked about a potential Border poll. “The framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement. “Today is a recommitment to that and to the approach and the role of the UK government and that is the honest broker. “I am Prime Minister for the whole of the UK, elected into office just a few days ago. “But to reaffirm the importance of the principles of the Good Friday Agreement is part and parcel of why I am here today.” Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Starmer was elected the new British Prime Minister following Thursday\'s General Election across the United Kingdom. His Labour party clinched what is being described as a ""landslide"" victory over Conservatives, who had been in power for more than a decade. In October last year, Starmer said an Irish border poll is ""absolutely hypothetical"" and ""not even on the horizon."" He had previously said that he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK if a referendum is held during his lifetime, stating that he would ""make the case for the United Kingdom."" Starmer\'s comments in October drew some criticism from academics and pro-unity groups in Northern Ireland, but he appeared to offer a more diplomatic response on Monday in Belfast. As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" On Saturday, Northern Ireland\'s new Secretary of State Hillary Benn, also a member of the UK Labour Party, told reporters in Belfast that believes ""there is no evidence that that condition has been met"" to call a border poll, adding that he is ""not going to set out further criteria because there is the one criteria."" Meanwhile, Sinn Féin, Ireland\'s all-island nationalist party that campaigns on Irish unity, emerged as the biggest Northern Ireland party after last week\'s UK General Election. Of the 18 Westminster seats that were up for grabs in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin won the most, seven. The Democratic Unionist Party won five, the SDLP won two, and the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice, and an Independent each won one seat. (Sinn Féin, however, maintains a longstanding policy of not taking their seats in British Parliament, in part because it would require them to swear allegiance to the monarchy.) In its manifesto for the UK General Election, Sinn Féin said in part: ""The Irish and British governments must set a date for a referendum on Irish unity."" On Monday in Belfast, Starmer met with a Sinn Féin delegation that included Michelle O\'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and the vice president of the party, and Mary Lou McDonald, the party\'s president. O\'Neill described Sinn Féin\'s engagements with Starmer on Monday as ""productive."" Our Sinn Féin delegation held a productive meeting with the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer.

Mary Lou McDonald, the President of Sinn Féin, called for “a mature conversation on constitutional change” regarding Irish reunification during her keynote address at Sinn Féin\'s fringe meeting at the British Labour Party Conference in Liverpool on Sunday, September 22. “Part of this new chapter must be the realization that constitutional change in Ireland is coming,"" McDonald said on Sunday.

The morning after her keynote address, McDonald told Sky News: ""We are hopeful, we anticipate, and we expect that Keir Starmer as Prime Minister that the whole administration will now come behind the Good Friday Agreement in its totality to bring the Irish story, the journey towards peace, to the next destination. ""And, of course, at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, is a provision for referendums to end the partition of our island and, really, to complete the journey to equality and to peace."" McDonald said she hopes Starmer will ""grasp this historic opportunity and I hope he, like I, would wish that when the history books record the Irish history and the final, full resolution of the Irish conflict that it might be a Labour Prime Minister who had the vision and the integrity to take these next steps with us."" Sky News pointed out that McDonald\'s optimism is at odds with Starmer\'s comments last year when he claimed an Irish unity referendum is ""not even on the horizon."" However, after he became British Prime Minister in July, Starmer softened his approach slightly, saying that “the framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement."" McDonald acknowledged on Monday that she is ""forever optimistic,"" but ""not naive."" She said as Prime Minister he, along with the British and Irish governments, are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and that ""you can\'t cherry pick from it."" She said that the obligation to plan for the future and to plan for these referendums runs right alongside the ""working together in the here and now."" She continued: We shouldn\'t stumble into this. ""With all due respect, we watched the manner in which the Brexit debate happened, and to us that was a case study on how not to do it."" McDonald went on to reiterate that she wants ""preparation,"" ""dialogue,"" and ""mature conversation"" amongst the people on the island of Ireland and ""critically, between the Dublin and the London administrations."" She continued: ""And by the way, this Irish story of finding peace and reunification is great news for all of us. This is right for Ireland, but I would submit right for Britain as well. It\'s right for the British people and the Irish people for us to live not just as good neighbors but I would hope, ultimately, as the very best of friends."" When asked if she expects Starmer to ""promise the world"" in regards to discussions on Irish unity, McDonald replied: ""I\'m not asking for the world. ""We as Irish people are not asking for anything more or less than we are legally entitled to and nothing more or less than what\'s contained in the Good Friday Agreement. “I didn’t invent this idea on my way into studio. This is a long-standing provision of an Agreement that is now 26 years old. “And what I am saying I suppose, in summary, is that all parties to the Agreement now need to recognize the depth of change that is happening in Ireland. “The Unionist majority in the North of Ireland, the electoral majority, is gone. It’s not coming back. “We live in the now and we have to plan for the future. “I am asking for, and we are promoting, dialogue, inclusion amongst all stakeholders of all perspectives. “But there has to be clarity from the British government - and, by the way, the government in Dublin - that the referendum provisions of the Good Friday Agreement were not drafted to lie dormant but will, in fact, be enacted and that the people ultimately will have our say and decide our future together democratically and peacefully and in a spirit of respect, cooperation, and indeed friendship with Britain."" As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" McDonald noted while on Sky News that for the first time ever, Sinn Féin is the largest party in Northern Ireland and holds the office of First Minister. Despite this, opinion polls have not found overwhelming support for a border poll. In February, a LucidTalk poll for the Belfast Telegraph found that 49% of respondents in Northern Ireland would vote to remain in the UK if a border poll was held within a week, while 39% would vote to leave the UK and join Ireland. However, in Ireland, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement said in July that preparation for referenda on Irish unification will be ""a historic task"" and called for ""preparation to begin immediately.""']",northern - agreement - british - friday - good - new - minister - unity - future - election,0.9491956131087733,False
"Irish Government announces 62 new rural walking trails Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys announced the expansion on Wednesday, taking the total number of nationally recognized walking trails to 140.

Due to the time lapse in the start date, officials will have to seek new government consent to move forward with the 1916 Easter Rising museum located in houses used during the rebel leader\'s retreats. According to reports by the National Monuments Service, Ireland\'s Office of Public Works, an Irish Government agency, that manages most of the Irish State\'s property portfolio, has said it must seek new government consent to move ahead with the plans for a museum on Moore Street, in Dublin city center, dedicated to the Easter Rising 1916. The OPW say it\'s ""difficult to be specific about when work will start on site."" The houses at 14–17 Moore Street are historically significant due to their key role in the final days of the 1916 Easter Rising. After the surrender of the General Post Office (GPO) on O’Connell Street, which had served as the headquarters for the leaders of the Rising, the surviving rebel leaders and their forces were forced to retreat. They made their way to Moore Street, using the terrace of buildings as cover. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The museum, part of the National Monuments Service, was due to open initially in 1916 for the Easter Rising\'s centenary anniversary. Work on the 1916 museum was set to begin in 2023 with an estimated cost of €16.25 million ($17.95m). However, the Irish Times reports that no contractors have been engaged to commence work, by the OPW. An update provided by the Moore Street advisory group provided this week says the OPW would need to seek fresh “ministerial consent” from the Minister for Heritage, due to the passage of time, the Times reports. O\'Connell Bridge, in Dublin, in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising. They stated it would be ""difficult to be specific about when work will start on site”. “Currently, they [the OPW] plan to apply to the Minister for a Ministerial Consent under the National Monuments Act in September and will hope to go out to tender as early as possible in 2025,” the update from the Monuments Service, which is under the aegis of the Department of Heritage said. “It should be stressed that these are estimates only.” Green Party Dublin City Councillor Donna Cooney told the Times she\'d expected construction to begin last year. Cooney said “It appears to have taken more than a year just to decide that a new ministerial consent is needed when we thought work would be well underway by now. It’s nine years since the State purchased this national monument and each year we lose more Moore Street campaigners, elderly people who will now not see the center opened.” The buildings, 14 to 17 Moore Street, were named as a national monument in 2007. This was opened to the public and was approved by An Bord Pleanála (the planning board) in 2010. The houses were bought by the Irish State in 2015. Minister for Heritage, Heather Humphreys, said at the time the buildings were a ""very important element"" of the 1916 centenary plans of 2016. The Easter Rising parade in 2016 in Dublin. Shortly after relatives of the Easter Rising participants took legal action. They asked that most of Moore Street be given national monument status, not just 14 to 17. Several houses on the road were due for demolition and a shopping center was to be built. In 2016, Justice Max Barrett suspended works on the buildings including the 1916 museum. In 2018, the Court of Appeal overturned this ruling. The then minister for heritage, Josepha Madigan, said the opening of the museum would be a “top priority”. In December 2019 her department said they were “not as yet in a position to say when the project will get underway”. In July 2024 the Moore Street Preservation Trust met with the Dublin inner-city task force and presented to the chairperson, David McRedmond, a master plan for transforming Moore Street into a cultural quarter. The great-grandson of James Connolly, an Easter Rising leader, told the Irish Independent “This was a constructive meeting,” James Connolly Heron said. “Our architect Seán Ó Muirí outlined the Moore Street Preservation Trust’s Master Plan. “We believe the plan has the potential to transform this area, preserving our history and creating a vibrant focus for the north inner city. “We emphasized the need to cherish both the 1916 Rising heritage and the street trading tradition of Moore Street. “Mr McRedmond engaged constructively, and we look forward to these issues being positively reflected to the Taoiseach in the Task Force’s report and recommendations.” These houses were the last headquarters of the 1916 Easter leaders. After evacuating the GPO, key leaders of the Rising, including Patrick Pearse, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett, Tom Clarke, and Seán Mac Diarmada, sought refuge in these houses. They moved through the buildings by tunneling through walls to avoid sniper fire from British forces. Easter Rising Leader Padraig Pearse surrenders. It was at 16 Moore Street that the leaders of the Rising held their final council meeting to discuss their next steps. With dwindling resources, heavy casualties, and civilian suffering, they concluded that surrender was the only viable option. Patrick Pearse, the leader of the rebellion, drafted the formal surrender order at 16 Moore Street. The following day, on April 29, 1916, Pearse left from this location to surrender to the British forces. These buildings are considered some of the last surviving physical remnants of the 1916 Rising, making them a crucial part of Ireland\'s national history.', 'New state-of-the-art library unveiled in Kilkenny Mayfair Library has been transformed from an old ballroom into a state-of-the-art library and community facility as part of the development. Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys has unveiled Ireland\'s newest library in Kilkenny City in addition to announcing an investment of €25 million in Ireland\'s public library services. Mayfair Library, a €7.2 million project funded by Kilkenny County Council and the Department of Rural and Local Development, has been transformed from an old ballroom into a state-of-the-art library and community facility as part of the development. Located in the heart of medieval Kilkenny, the library features digital spaces for training and innovation, providing access to 3D printers, 3D scanners, and sewing machines. It also features space for workshops, lectures, training, and community engagement events. Humphreys, who toured the new library, has announced that the additional investment of €25 million will create 11 new public libraries and 12 Next Generation mobile library vehicles, representing one of the most significant investments in Irish library services in recent years.

"Co Kerry men hanged for murder in 1882 set to receive Presidential pardons Sylvester Poff and James Barrett are set to receive Presidential pardons after they were wrongfully convicted of murder in Co Kerry in 1882. Ireland's Minister for Justice Helen McEntee TD secured Government approval on Tuesday, April 16 to recommend to President Higgins to grant a posthumous presidential pardon to Sylvester Poff and James Barrett. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Thomas Browne in October 1882 and were both executed in January 1883. Ireland's Department of Justice said on Tuesday that given a number of factors in this case, and based upon the detailed Report received from Dr. Niamh Howlin, Minister McEntee and her government colleagues decided to recommend to the President that he exercise his right to pardon, contained in Article 13.6 of the Constitution on the grounds their convictions were unsafe.

The 1880s in Ireland brought frequent agitation for land reform, which often developed into agrarian violence, with outrages pertaining to matters such as landlords, evictions, rent strikes, and boycotts, known as the Land War. In May 1882, the murders of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Chief Secretary, and his Under Secretary, T.H. Burke were carried out in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Referred to as the Phoenix Park Murders, they were the catalyst for the legislative response to the growing agrarian unrest. The Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Act 1882 (1882 Act) was a piece of coercive legislation passed in July 1882 in the aftermath of the Phoenix Park murders to clamp down on crimes such as “treason, murder, arson, attacks on dwelling-houses and crimes of aggravated violence.” Co Kerry and the area around Castleisland in particular, was experiencing a great deal of unrest and violence during this period. On October 3, 1882, Thomas Browne was murdered while working in one of his fields in Dromulton, near Scartaglin in Co Kerry. Two men in dark coats, seen from behind, shot him several times. Sylvester Poff and James Barrett, who did not match the descriptions of the assailants, were known to be in the vicinity at the time. The two men were arrested following a statement by a neighbour that they had seen them enter the field where Browne was shot. The prosecution case largely rested on the evidence of a neighbour, whose story changed as the case progressed and who could not be regarded as a reliable witness. Poff and Barrett were tried twice before special juries in Cork for the murder of Browne after the jury in the first trial failed to reach agreement on a verdict. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Browne in December 1882 and, despite petitions for mercy to the Lord Lieutenant, they were hanged in Tralee Gaol in January 1883. Dr. Niamh Howlin, an expert in 19th Century trial law and an Associate Professor in the Sutherland School of Law, UCD, was engaged by the Department of Justice to undertake an independent external review of the case and to advise upon the safety of the conviction or otherwise, with clear reference to the prevailing standards at the time. Dr. Howlin's examination concluded that a number of factors, including in the investigation and procedures around the trial, led her to form the opinion that Poff's and Barrett's convictions were unsafe. These factors included: a ‘packed jury,' evidential deficiencies (including conflicting witness testimony), no motive, and that other lines of enquiry appear to have been neglected during the investigation and trial. In addition, the report found that there was no direct evidence against Poff and Barrett, with the case resting on the circumstantial and contradictory evidence of one witness. Dr Howlin concluded her report by stating: ""A twenty-first century criminal court would not convict Poff and Barrett on the basis of the evidence which was presented by the Crown in 1882. The convictions were also inconsistent with the legal standards of the period. “They were convicted on the basis of evidence which was both circumstantial and weak. The trials and conviction of Poff and Barrett included legal and procedural deficiencies which were ‘so inconsistent with the legal standards of the period and so objectively unsatisfactory and unfair, that they render the conviction unsafe.” This is the fourth occasion that a posthumous Presidential Pardon could be awarded. The first posthumous Presidential Pardon was awarded by President Higgins to Harry Gleeson in 2015. The second posthumous Presidential Pardon, and the first to be granted for events which occurred prior to the formation of the State, was granted to Myles Joyce in April 2018, who was executed having been found guilty of involvement in the Maamtrasna murders in 1882.

"Irish Government launches new Civil War mapping project The Irish Civil War Fatalities Project represens the first systematic attempt to investigate the number of people killed during the Civil War. The Irish Government has launched a new digital mapping project, listing all of the civilian and combatant fatalities of the Irish Civil War. Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media Catherine Martin announced the Irish Civil War Fatalities Project on Monday, representing the first systematic attempt to investigate the number of people killed during the Civil War. Historians have generally been confined to estimates when calculating the human cost of the conflict but can now avail of an academically contextualized database and interactive map. The interactive map covers all of the civilian and combatant fatalities that occurred on the island of Ireland between June 28, 1922, and May 24, 1923, covering the period from the opening shots of the conflict until the ceasefire and dumping of arms. The map indicates that the Civil War was most violent, brutal, and protracted in Counties Kerry, Tipperary, and Louth. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! It also highlights that there were considerably fewer casualties during the Civil War than in the Irish War of Independence, primarily due to a lack of deliberate killing of civilians. Civilians were three times more likely to be killed during the War of Independence than in the Civil War, according to the new data. The new database also contradicts the popular belief that the major combat of the Civil War ended within two months of the beginning of the conflict, highlighting a spike in fatalities in the autumn of 1922 and again in March 1923 due to a series of reprisal killings. The project provides new insights into one of the darkest periods in Irish history, studying the frequency, nature, and concentration of violence that took place during the Civil War. The interactive map was developed by University College Cork in collaboration with RTÉ and the Irish Military Archives. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media funded the project under the Historical Strand of the Decade of Centenaries Programme 2012-2023. Launching the program on Monday, Minister Catherine Martin described the interactive map as an ""engaging, innovative, and accessible resource"". ""The Irish Civil War was a great national tragedy and left a deep wound in the newly independent State,"" Martin said in a statement. Love Irish history?

""The significant loss of life and the injury to the fabric of our communities, and many families, were felt for generations, even to this day.

Dr. Andy Bielenberg, principal investigator of the Irish Civil War Fatalities Project and Senior Lecturer at UCC School of History, said the new tool provides fresh insights into the Irish Civil War. ""The interactive map will be an invaluable tool for researching family history, local history, and filling in gaps in our knowledge about the Civil War,"" he said. Additionally, the new database includes a series of articles by invited scholars contextualizing the conflict in local areas, including Dr. John O’Callaghan on the Civil War in County Limerick; Owen O’Shea on the Civil War in Kerry; Dr. Helene O’Keefe on child victims of political violence and Professor Pauric Travers on the Civil War in County Donegal.",-1,-1_citizenship_war_ceremonies_civil,"['citizenship', 'war', 'ceremonies', 'civil', 'citizens', 'dogs', 'kerry', 'department', 'justice', 'bully']","['Co Kerry men hanged for murder in 1882 set to receive Presidential pardons Sylvester Poff and James Barrett are set to receive Presidential pardons after they were wrongfully convicted of murder in Co Kerry in 1882.

"New state-of-the-art library unveiled in Kilkenny Mayfair Library has been transformed from an old ballroom into a state-of-the-art library and community facility as part of the development. Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys has unveiled Ireland's newest library in Kilkenny City in addition to announcing an investment of €25 million in Ireland's public library services. Mayfair Library, a €7.2 million project funded by Kilkenny County Council and the Department of Rural and Local Development, has been transformed from an old ballroom into a state-of-the-art library and community facility as part of the development. Located in the heart of medieval Kilkenny, the library features digital spaces for training and innovation, providing access to 3D printers, 3D scanners, and sewing machines. It also features space for workshops, lectures, training, and community engagement events. Humphreys, who toured the new library, has announced that the additional investment of €25 million will create 11 new public libraries and 12 Next Generation mobile library vehicles, representing one of the most significant investments in Irish library services in recent years.

Due to the time lapse in the start date, officials will have to seek new government consent to move forward with the 1916 Easter Rising museum located in houses used during the rebel leader\'s retreats. According to reports by the National Monuments Service, Ireland\'s Office of Public Works, an Irish Government agency, that manages most of the Irish State\'s property portfolio, has said it must seek new government consent to move ahead with the plans for a museum on Moore Street, in Dublin city center, dedicated to the Easter Rising 1916. The OPW say it\'s ""difficult to be specific about when work will start on site."" The houses at 14–17 Moore Street are historically significant due to their key role in the final days of the 1916 Easter Rising. After the surrender of the General Post Office (GPO) on O’Connell Street, which had served as the headquarters for the leaders of the Rising, the surviving rebel leaders and their forces were forced to retreat. They made their way to Moore Street, using the terrace of buildings as cover. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The museum, part of the National Monuments Service, was due to open initially in 1916 for the Easter Rising\'s centenary anniversary. Work on the 1916 museum was set to begin in 2023 with an estimated cost of €16.25 million ($17.95m). However, the Irish Times reports that no contractors have been engaged to commence work, by the OPW. An update provided by the Moore Street advisory group provided this week says the OPW would need to seek fresh “ministerial consent” from the Minister for Heritage, due to the passage of time, the Times reports. O\'Connell Bridge, in Dublin, in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising. They stated it would be ""difficult to be specific about when work will start on site”. “Currently, they [the OPW] plan to apply to the Minister for a Ministerial Consent under the National Monuments Act in September and will hope to go out to tender as early as possible in 2025,” the update from the Monuments Service, which is under the aegis of the Department of Heritage said. “It should be stressed that these are estimates only.” Green Party Dublin City Councillor Donna Cooney told the Times she\'d expected construction to begin last year. Cooney said “It appears to have taken more than a year just to decide that a new ministerial consent is needed when we thought work would be well underway by now. It’s nine years since the State purchased this national monument and each year we lose more Moore Street campaigners, elderly people who will now not see the center opened.” The buildings, 14 to 17 Moore Street, were named as a national monument in 2007. This was opened to the public and was approved by An Bord Pleanála (the planning board) in 2010. The houses were bought by the Irish State in 2015. Minister for Heritage, Heather Humphreys, said at the time the buildings were a ""very important element"" of the 1916 centenary plans of 2016. The Easter Rising parade in 2016 in Dublin. Shortly after relatives of the Easter Rising participants took legal action. They asked that most of Moore Street be given national monument status, not just 14 to 17. Several houses on the road were due for demolition and a shopping center was to be built. In 2016, Justice Max Barrett suspended works on the buildings including the 1916 museum. In 2018, the Court of Appeal overturned this ruling. The then minister for heritage, Josepha Madigan, said the opening of the museum would be a “top priority”. In December 2019 her department said they were “not as yet in a position to say when the project will get underway”. In July 2024 the Moore Street Preservation Trust met with the Dublin inner-city task force and presented to the chairperson, David McRedmond, a master plan for transforming Moore Street into a cultural quarter. The great-grandson of James Connolly, an Easter Rising leader, told the Irish Independent “This was a constructive meeting,” James Connolly Heron said. “Our architect Seán Ó Muirí outlined the Moore Street Preservation Trust’s Master Plan. “We believe the plan has the potential to transform this area, preserving our history and creating a vibrant focus for the north inner city. “We emphasized the need to cherish both the 1916 Rising heritage and the street trading tradition of Moore Street. “Mr McRedmond engaged constructively, and we look forward to these issues being positively reflected to the Taoiseach in the Task Force’s report and recommendations.” These houses were the last headquarters of the 1916 Easter leaders. After evacuating the GPO, key leaders of the Rising, including Patrick Pearse, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett, Tom Clarke, and Seán Mac Diarmada, sought refuge in these houses. They moved through the buildings by tunneling through walls to avoid sniper fire from British forces. Easter Rising Leader Padraig Pearse surrenders. It was at 16 Moore Street that the leaders of the Rising held their final council meeting to discuss their next steps. With dwindling resources, heavy casualties, and civilian suffering, they concluded that surrender was the only viable option. Patrick Pearse, the leader of the rebellion, drafted the formal surrender order at 16 Moore Street. The following day, on April 29, 1916, Pearse left from this location to surrender to the British forces. These buildings are considered some of the last surviving physical remnants of the 1916 Rising, making them a crucial part of Ireland\'s national history.', 'New state-of-the-art library unveiled in Kilkenny Mayfair Library has been transformed from an old ballroom into a state-of-the-art library and community facility as part of the development.

"Palestine beat Bohemians in historic Dublin friendly The friendly, played in front of a sell-out crowd at Bohemians' home ground Dalymount Park on Wednesday night, was the Palestine team's first-ever game in Europe. President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins and Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald were both in attendance as League of Ireland club Bohemians hosted the Palestine women's team in a historic friendly in Dublin on Wednesday. The friendly, played in front of a sell-out crowd at Bohemians' home ground Dalymount Park on Wednesday night, was the Palestine team's first-ever game in Europe. Palestine won Wednesday's emotional friendly 2-1, which took place on Nakba Day, an annual commemoration of the forced displacement of Palestinians following the foundation of Israel. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! However, the result had little to do with Wednesday's historic friendly, which offered people an opportunity to show solidarity with Palestine during the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The 4,290 people were in attendance, with many people waving Palestinian flags, displaying homemade signs with messages of solidarity for Palestine, or wearing traditional Palestinian keffiyehs. Irish Palestinian artist Roisin El Cherif sang the Fedayeen Warrior- the national anthem of Palestine - while Radie Peat of Irish folk group Lankum gave a rousing rendition of Amhrán na bhFiann. A minute's silence also took place before kickoff to remember all of those who have died as a result of Israeli's occupation and violence in Gaza. Bohs had the better of the early exchanges when the match eventually kicked off amid an impassioned atmosphere, with the sold-out crowd cheering on the Palestinian team at every opportunity. This may have nominally been a home game for Bohemains, but it did not feel like it, such was the level of support from the Dalymount faithful. The first half ended goalless, with both sides enjoying bright spells and spurning chances in front of goal, but the crowd greeted the halftime whistle with a roar befitting of the game's opening goal. Irish singer Mary Black performed a stirring rendition of ""No Frontiers"" during the interval, stepping in at the last minute in place of Christy Moore, who was forced to withdraw from the event. Palestine v Bohs ????? ❤️ pic.twitter.com/wwdZheMB7P Bohs took the lead shortly after the break through Katie Malone, sparking a pre-planned celebration among the home team, who huddled together to display a Palestinian t-shirt. Palestine, however, responded quickly through an own goal from Shauna Carroll and completed the turnaround with 12 minutes remaining through Union Berlin striker Nour Youseff, sparking wild celebrations among the sold-out crowd. The result mattered little, with both sets of players embracing at the full-time whistle and lapping up support from the crowd. ??❤️??? Bohemians ?Palestine pic.twitter.com/fsmXo50rGv Bohs captain Rachael Kelly said she wasn't surprised to see such strong support for Palestine, despite Wednesday's friendly being a home match for the Irish club. ""We're Irish, the solidarity is there. The people wanted the girls to get the win. And absolutely, we were clapping for them ourselves. So look, it was brilliant. And the fans, everyone that came today that made it so much more special we're so thankful for,"" Kelly told Dublin radio station FM104. Kelly's Bohs teammate Orlagh Fitzpatrick said she was proud to take part in a moment of history. ""I think it's it's very emotional for both sides. I think the girls coming over really gave us something to think about,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""It does give you things to be grateful for, the little things, and we are definitely proud in that sense to be a part of their history. We want to show them that we do stand with them and everything going on."" Palestinian goalkeeper Charlotte Phillips said she was instantly in tears after walking out onto the pitch and seeing the support for the Palestine team. ""I was in tears. Right away. I saw them as soon as we walked out, you couldn't really hear them too much from the changing room. So as soon as we walked down, we saw the full house. Oh my gosh, I've never seen that many Palestinian flags in the same room. Yeah, I was instantly in tears,"" Phillips told FM104. Wednesday's friendly also featured a collectible matchday program, which featured poetry and paintings. The program also featured some criticism of Israel and FIFA President Gianni Infantino but was mainly a celebration of the Palestinian women's team traveling from the West Bank and around the world to take on Bohs.

Ireland\'s Minister for Justice Helen McEntee TD secured Government approval on Tuesday, April 16 to recommend to President Higgins to grant a posthumous presidential pardon to Sylvester Poff and James Barrett. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Thomas Browne in October 1882 and were both executed in January 1883. Ireland\'s Department of Justice said on Tuesday that given a number of factors in this case, and based upon the detailed Report received from Dr. Niamh Howlin, Minister McEntee and her government colleagues decided to recommend to the President that he exercise his right to pardon, contained in Article 13.6 of the Constitution on the grounds their convictions were unsafe. The granting of a Presidential Pardon is a right which should be offered only in the most deserving of circumstances, the Department noted. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Minister McEntee said on Tuesday: “This is a very rare occurrence and a very high bar must be reached for the Government to recommend to the president that he exercise this right. “Having considered the findings in Dr Howlin’s report, the trial, conviction, and execution of Mr. Poff and Mr. Barrett were unfair by the standards of the time. “Both men were wrongfully convicted and suffered the harshest penalty under the law of the time in what can now be attributed to a miscarriage of justice. “I would like to acknowledge the work done by the Castleisland District Heritage Inc. Michael O’Donohue Memorial Project in bringing this case to my Department.” Johnnie Roche, Chairman of Castleisland District Heritage, shakes hands with Tomo Burke, great grandson of Sylvester... The 1880s in Ireland brought frequent agitation for land reform, which often developed into agrarian violence, with outrages pertaining to matters such as landlords, evictions, rent strikes, and boycotts, known as the Land War. In May 1882, the murders of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Chief Secretary, and his Under Secretary, T.H. Burke were carried out in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Referred to as the Phoenix Park Murders, they were the catalyst for the legislative response to the growing agrarian unrest. The Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Act 1882 (1882 Act) was a piece of coercive legislation passed in July 1882 in the aftermath of the Phoenix Park murders to clamp down on crimes such as “treason, murder, arson, attacks on dwelling-houses and crimes of aggravated violence.” Co Kerry and the area around Castleisland in particular, was experiencing a great deal of unrest and violence during this period. On October 3, 1882, Thomas Browne was murdered while working in one of his fields in Dromulton, near Scartaglin in Co Kerry. Two men in dark coats, seen from behind, shot him several times. Sylvester Poff and James Barrett, who did not match the descriptions of the assailants, were known to be in the vicinity at the time. The two men were arrested following a statement by a neighbour that they had seen them enter the field where Browne was shot. The prosecution case largely rested on the evidence of a neighbour, whose story changed as the case progressed and who could not be regarded as a reliable witness. Poff and Barrett were tried twice before special juries in Cork for the murder of Browne after the jury in the first trial failed to reach agreement on a verdict. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Browne in December 1882 and, despite petitions for mercy to the Lord Lieutenant, they were hanged in Tralee Gaol in January 1883. Dr. Niamh Howlin, an expert in 19th Century trial law and an Associate Professor in the Sutherland School of Law, UCD, was engaged by the Department of Justice to undertake an independent external review of the case and to advise upon the safety of the conviction or otherwise, with clear reference to the prevailing standards at the time. Dr. Howlin\'s examination concluded that a number of factors, including in the investigation and procedures around the trial, led her to form the opinion that Poff\'s and Barrett\'s convictions were unsafe. These factors included: a ‘packed jury,\' evidential deficiencies (including conflicting witness testimony), no motive, and that other lines of enquiry appear to have been neglected during the investigation and trial. In addition, the report found that there was no direct evidence against Poff and Barrett, with the case resting on the circumstantial and contradictory evidence of one witness. Dr Howlin concluded her report by stating: ""A twenty-first century criminal court would not convict Poff and Barrett on the basis of the evidence which was presented by the Crown in 1882. The convictions were also inconsistent with the legal standards of the period. “They were convicted on the basis of evidence which was both circumstantial and weak. The trials and conviction of Poff and Barrett included legal and procedural deficiencies which were ‘so inconsistent with the legal standards of the period and so objectively unsatisfactory and unfair, that they render the conviction unsafe.” This is the fourth occasion that a posthumous Presidential Pardon could be awarded. The first posthumous Presidential Pardon was awarded by President Higgins to Harry Gleeson in 2015. The second posthumous Presidential Pardon, and the first to be granted for events which occurred prior to the formation of the State, was granted to Myles Joyce in April 2018, who was executed having been found guilty of involvement in the Maamtrasna murders in 1882. The third posthumous pardon was awarded to John Twiss in 2021. The threshold to recommend a Presidential Pardon is high and, since 1937, only seven Presidential Pardons have been awarded.', 'Thousands receive Irish citizenship as part of ""wonderful celebration"" in Killarney More than 100 people from the US were among the thousands who received Irish citizenship during ceremonies in Killarney this week. 4,800 people were granted Irish citizenship in six ceremonies which took place on Monday, June 10 and Tuesday, June 11 at the INEC Killarney in Co Kerry.

Northern Ireland's Secretary of State Chris Heaton-Harris predicts that he will not see a border poll on the island of Ireland in his lifetime.

""You're constantly talking to politicians and civil society, it generally is a whole host of things. ""And, to be quite frank, I can't see it in my lifetime."" He continued: “I think the conditions are good for there not to be a border poll for a very, very long time.” He further said: “If you look at the latest polling in the Republic of Ireland about this - and people vote with both their hearts and their heads on these matters - I think we are a long way off that.” Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish!

He highlighted his work on the Windsor Framework, as well as the ""Safeguarding the Union"" command paper which helped lead to the return of Stormont. He wrote to Sunak: ""I strongly believe the conditions now exist for Northern Ireland to thrive, with privileged access for manufactured goods into the EU single market, whilst being an integral part of our UK internal market and being able to benefit from the international trade deals we negotiate; it finds itself in a remarkable favourable position - and as Northern Ireland thrives, our Union strengthens.""

Two things I never do at the start of a New Year: predictions and resolutions. Resolutions fall by the wayside as old habits regroup. Predictions never fully pan out. The unexpected can and will happen. Choices will have unforeseen consequences. And 2024 will be a year of choices that will define the coming years. This year will likely see general elections in Britain and the South of Ireland. I say likely, as both the British and Irish Governments have home team advantage in terms of setting an election date. Elections must be held before the Spring of 2025. Neither are likely to plan an election in the first months of next year. There are also elections set for June in the South of Ireland for local councils and the EU Parliament. The Irish Government is also planning to hold a referendum to amend an archaic constitutional definition of the role of women in the home. Their replacement wording, which was leaked to the media, has failed to inspire and will no doubt be contested. Under referendum rules, equal time and support have to be given to both sides of the constitutional plebiscite. This is also an election year in the US. By the end of the year, there could be new Irish and British Governments, significant changes in the EU parliament and Commission, and changes in both houses of Congress and the Administration. All of these choices are in the hands of the people. Those choices will have fundamental impacts on Ireland, Anglo-Irish relations, and Irish-American relations as well as the wider European and global community. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The coming Irish general election could be historic. Last time out, Sinn Féin emerged as the largest party. A position that they have consolidated. Until then, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had controlled both government and opposition since the foundation of the state. Following that election, both entered government as part of a coalition with the Green party. Their common policy objective was to keep Sinn Féin out. Mary Lou McDonald became the first woman and the first Sinn Féin president to lead the official opposition. Since then, support for the party has grown. The Sinn Féin president has not hidden the party\'s ambition to lead a government, preferably without Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In doing so, she would become the first woman to be Taoiseach in the first Sinn Féin-led government. It would be an opportunity to break from the past. The party is also confident in gaining ground in the local and European elections in the South. The European parliamentary elections are held on the same week across the member states. There has been a rise of reactionary right-wing parties in Italy, Holland, and Germany. The EU faces continued challenges with the war in Ukraine, a lack of consensus on a ceasefire in the siege of Gaza, and expansion plans with additional states wishing to join. It remains to be seen how these elections will pan out. The parliament and commission are facing significant strategic challenges that will define the EU project for decades to come. One thing is for certain, Britain will not have a say. As a consequence of the choice of Brexit, they have left the Parliament and Commission. The British Labour Party has maintained a significant lead over the governing Tory Party. It has been 12 years since the last Labour Government. Given the extent of the Labour Party\'s lead and the daily scandals and dysfunctions of the current government, it seems that Labour is well-placed to win. This has led to the Labour Leader, Keir Starmer taking conservative and cautious positions on most issues. The party appears to rely on voters\' opposition to the Tories more than articulating what the Labour Party stands for. It remains to be seen what difference a Labour-led government will make with regards to policy in Ireland and the EU. One of the first things to land on the new Prime Minister\'s desk will be defending the current British government\'s Legacy Legislation in the European Court of Human Rights. The outgoing government passed the law that ends police and police ombudsman investigations into actions during the conflict. It blocks the right to inquests and access to the courts for those bereaved. It has been opposed by the victims, all parties in Ireland, and human rights organizations. It was also opposed by the British Labour Party in Westminster. Just before Christmas, the Irish Government initiated an inter-state case against the British Government\'s Legacy law in the European Courts. It is expected that the case will be heard within the next two years. The choice facing Keir Starmer will be to defend in government a law that is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement and that he opposed or stand by his word and revoke the law and return to the existing governmental and cross-party Stormont House Agreement. The election calculations will be playing out within the Democratic Unionist Party. They have seats at Westminster to defend at a time when they block government formation in the North and possible changes of governments in London and Dublin. Despite its grand title, the largest unionist party has a selective approach to democracy. 18 months ago, the vast majority of voters supported a return to government in Stormont. Sinn Féin became the largest party in the jurisdiction and Michelle O’Neill the First Minister-elect. The DUP has refused to respect these results and continues to block the government. It appears that sharing power with an Irish Republican First Minister is a step too far for some elements of their party. The DUP are masters at only making a decision when they absolutely have to; when the alternative to doing nothing comes at a cost to their party. Over the past 18 months, they have been facilitated by the British Government. The cost has been paid by the public, the economy, and confidence in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP has not moved despite a change in presentation. The party made infamous for saying “no” has presented itself over the past 18 months as the party of “no, but maybe."" It is well past decision time for the DUP. The two outgoing governments should now set out how North/South and the devolved institutions will be operated, and the Agreement protected in the absence of the DUP and a functioning Executive. The DUP will do what the DUP will do. It is up to either the outgoing or incoming governments to progress the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Regardless of the election outcomes, the case for Irish Unity continues. The genie is out of the bottle, the debate is now live in homes, academia, and the legal, arts, and business communities. It is an exciting time. A Sinn Féin-led government in Dublin will prepare, plan, and advocate for unity. A Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government may continue to prevaricate. The election outcome may accelerate or slow the progress, but it cannot be stopped. An Irish government planning and preparing for unity is a constitutional and political imperative. Everyone agrees that referendums are coming. The sensible thing to do would be to plan and prepare. An Irish Government leading on the issue would be a game changer north and south, between Britain and Ireland and internationally. Unity referendums, the right of the people who share the island to define their constitutional future, are a foundation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not a point of contention. It is part of the agreement and a settled matter. It binds the British Government to act with rigorous impartiality in the discussion and to act on the outcome of the referendums. The discussions will continue to grow across Ireland and the US. In a world in which the international order has broken down, Ireland and our peace process can continue to act as a beacon of hope. Managing the process of change is a crucial challenge to the incoming governments. Honoring agreements and laws, respecting democracy, and vindicating rights remain the means to assert the primacy of politics over conflict. That has been the lesson of the Irish Peace Process. The current impasse can and will be overcome when governments return to those principles. This year will be a year of choices for people and governments. I cannot predict what the end of the year will look like, but I hope those in power remember the lessons of the past and commit to a better future for all. I am confident that whatever the outcome of the elections in the US, Ireland will continue to have a partner for peace. *Ciarán Quinn is Sinn Fein representative to US.', 'On Irish Border poll, new British Prime Minister is ""committed to the Good Friday Agreement"" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in Belfast that the UK government\'s role in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and an Irish border poll is an ""honest broker."" Keir Starmer addressed the potential of a Border poll while in Northern Ireland on Monday, July 8 as part of a tour of the UK after being elected as the new British Prime Minister last Thursday. “This is provided for by the Good Friday Agreement,” Starmer told reporters at Government Buildings in Belfast on Monday when asked about a potential Border poll. “The framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement. “Today is a recommitment to that and to the approach and the role of the UK government and that is the honest broker. “I am Prime Minister for the whole of the UK, elected into office just a few days ago. “But to reaffirm the importance of the principles of the Good Friday Agreement is part and parcel of why I am here today.” Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Starmer was elected the new British Prime Minister following Thursday\'s General Election across the United Kingdom. His Labour party clinched what is being described as a ""landslide"" victory over Conservatives, who had been in power for more than a decade. In October last year, Starmer said an Irish border poll is ""absolutely hypothetical"" and ""not even on the horizon."" He had previously said that he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK if a referendum is held during his lifetime, stating that he would ""make the case for the United Kingdom."" Starmer\'s comments in October drew some criticism from academics and pro-unity groups in Northern Ireland, but he appeared to offer a more diplomatic response on Monday in Belfast. As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" On Saturday, Northern Ireland\'s new Secretary of State Hillary Benn, also a member of the UK Labour Party, told reporters in Belfast that believes ""there is no evidence that that condition has been met"" to call a border poll, adding that he is ""not going to set out further criteria because there is the one criteria."" Meanwhile, Sinn Féin, Ireland\'s all-island nationalist party that campaigns on Irish unity, emerged as the biggest Northern Ireland party after last week\'s UK General Election. Of the 18 Westminster seats that were up for grabs in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin won the most, seven. The Democratic Unionist Party won five, the SDLP won two, and the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice, and an Independent each won one seat. (Sinn Féin, however, maintains a longstanding policy of not taking their seats in British Parliament, in part because it would require them to swear allegiance to the monarchy.) In its manifesto for the UK General Election, Sinn Féin said in part: ""The Irish and British governments must set a date for a referendum on Irish unity."" On Monday in Belfast, Starmer met with a Sinn Féin delegation that included Michelle O\'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and the vice president of the party, and Mary Lou McDonald, the party\'s president. O\'Neill described Sinn Féin\'s engagements with Starmer on Monday as ""productive."" Our Sinn Féin delegation held a productive meeting with the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer.

The morning after her keynote address, McDonald told Sky News: ""We are hopeful, we anticipate, and we expect that Keir Starmer as Prime Minister that the whole administration will now come behind the Good Friday Agreement in its totality to bring the Irish story, the journey towards peace, to the next destination. ""And, of course, at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, is a provision for referendums to end the partition of our island and, really, to complete the journey to equality and to peace."" McDonald said she hopes Starmer will ""grasp this historic opportunity and I hope he, like I, would wish that when the history books record the Irish history and the final, full resolution of the Irish conflict that it might be a Labour Prime Minister who had the vision and the integrity to take these next steps with us."" Sky News pointed out that McDonald\'s optimism is at odds with Starmer\'s comments last year when he claimed an Irish unity referendum is ""not even on the horizon."" However, after he became British Prime Minister in July, Starmer softened his approach slightly, saying that “the framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement."" McDonald acknowledged on Monday that she is ""forever optimistic,"" but ""not naive."" She said as Prime Minister he, along with the British and Irish governments, are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and that ""you can\'t cherry pick from it."" She said that the obligation to plan for the future and to plan for these referendums runs right alongside the ""working together in the here and now."" She continued: We shouldn\'t stumble into this. ""With all due respect, we watched the manner in which the Brexit debate happened, and to us that was a case study on how not to do it."" McDonald went on to reiterate that she wants ""preparation,"" ""dialogue,"" and ""mature conversation"" amongst the people on the island of Ireland and ""critically, between the Dublin and the London administrations."" She continued: ""And by the way, this Irish story of finding peace and reunification is great news for all of us. This is right for Ireland, but I would submit right for Britain as well. It\'s right for the British people and the Irish people for us to live not just as good neighbors but I would hope, ultimately, as the very best of friends."" When asked if she expects Starmer to ""promise the world"" in regards to discussions on Irish unity, McDonald replied: ""I\'m not asking for the world. ""We as Irish people are not asking for anything more or less than we are legally entitled to and nothing more or less than what\'s contained in the Good Friday Agreement. “I didn’t invent this idea on my way into studio. This is a long-standing provision of an Agreement that is now 26 years old. “And what I am saying I suppose, in summary, is that all parties to the Agreement now need to recognize the depth of change that is happening in Ireland. “The Unionist majority in the North of Ireland, the electoral majority, is gone. It’s not coming back. “We live in the now and we have to plan for the future. “I am asking for, and we are promoting, dialogue, inclusion amongst all stakeholders of all perspectives. “But there has to be clarity from the British government - and, by the way, the government in Dublin - that the referendum provisions of the Good Friday Agreement were not drafted to lie dormant but will, in fact, be enacted and that the people ultimately will have our say and decide our future together democratically and peacefully and in a spirit of respect, cooperation, and indeed friendship with Britain."" As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" McDonald noted while on Sky News that for the first time ever, Sinn Féin is the largest party in Northern Ireland and holds the office of First Minister. Despite this, opinion polls have not found overwhelming support for a border poll. In February, a LucidTalk poll for the Belfast Telegraph found that 49% of respondents in Northern Ireland would vote to remain in the UK if a border poll was held within a week, while 39% would vote to leave the UK and join Ireland. However, in Ireland, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement said in July that preparation for referenda on Irish unification will be ""a historic task"" and called for ""preparation to begin immediately.""']",northern - agreement - british - friday - good - new - minister - unity - future - election,1.0,False

Ireland\'s Minister for Justice Helen McEntee TD secured Government approval on Tuesday, April 16 to recommend to President Higgins to grant a posthumous presidential pardon to Sylvester Poff and James Barrett. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Thomas Browne in October 1882 and were both executed in January 1883. Ireland\'s Department of Justice said on Tuesday that given a number of factors in this case, and based upon the detailed Report received from Dr. Niamh Howlin, Minister McEntee and her government colleagues decided to recommend to the President that he exercise his right to pardon, contained in Article 13.6 of the Constitution on the grounds their convictions were unsafe. The granting of a Presidential Pardon is a right which should be offered only in the most deserving of circumstances, the Department noted. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Minister McEntee said on Tuesday: “This is a very rare occurrence and a very high bar must be reached for the Government to recommend to the president that he exercise this right. “Having considered the findings in Dr Howlin’s report, the trial, conviction, and execution of Mr. Poff and Mr. Barrett were unfair by the standards of the time. “Both men were wrongfully convicted and suffered the harshest penalty under the law of the time in what can now be attributed to a miscarriage of justice. “I would like to acknowledge the work done by the Castleisland District Heritage Inc. Michael O’Donohue Memorial Project in bringing this case to my Department.” Johnnie Roche, Chairman of Castleisland District Heritage, shakes hands with Tomo Burke, great grandson of Sylvester... The 1880s in Ireland brought frequent agitation for land reform, which often developed into agrarian violence, with outrages pertaining to matters such as landlords, evictions, rent strikes, and boycotts, known as the Land War. In May 1882, the murders of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Chief Secretary, and his Under Secretary, T.H. Burke were carried out in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Referred to as the Phoenix Park Murders, they were the catalyst for the legislative response to the growing agrarian unrest. The Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Act 1882 (1882 Act) was a piece of coercive legislation passed in July 1882 in the aftermath of the Phoenix Park murders to clamp down on crimes such as “treason, murder, arson, attacks on dwelling-houses and crimes of aggravated violence.” Co Kerry and the area around Castleisland in particular, was experiencing a great deal of unrest and violence during this period. On October 3, 1882, Thomas Browne was murdered while working in one of his fields in Dromulton, near Scartaglin in Co Kerry. Two men in dark coats, seen from behind, shot him several times. Sylvester Poff and James Barrett, who did not match the descriptions of the assailants, were known to be in the vicinity at the time. The two men were arrested following a statement by a neighbour that they had seen them enter the field where Browne was shot. The prosecution case largely rested on the evidence of a neighbour, whose story changed as the case progressed and who could not be regarded as a reliable witness. Poff and Barrett were tried twice before special juries in Cork for the murder of Browne after the jury in the first trial failed to reach agreement on a verdict. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Browne in December 1882 and, despite petitions for mercy to the Lord Lieutenant, they were hanged in Tralee Gaol in January 1883. Dr. Niamh Howlin, an expert in 19th Century trial law and an Associate Professor in the Sutherland School of Law, UCD, was engaged by the Department of Justice to undertake an independent external review of the case and to advise upon the safety of the conviction or otherwise, with clear reference to the prevailing standards at the time. Dr. Howlin\'s examination concluded that a number of factors, including in the investigation and procedures around the trial, led her to form the opinion that Poff\'s and Barrett\'s convictions were unsafe. These factors included: a ‘packed jury,\' evidential deficiencies (including conflicting witness testimony), no motive, and that other lines of enquiry appear to have been neglected during the investigation and trial. In addition, the report found that there was no direct evidence against Poff and Barrett, with the case resting on the circumstantial and contradictory evidence of one witness. Dr Howlin concluded her report by stating: ""A twenty-first century criminal court would not convict Poff and Barrett on the basis of the evidence which was presented by the Crown in 1882. The convictions were also inconsistent with the legal standards of the period. “They were convicted on the basis of evidence which was both circumstantial and weak. The trials and conviction of Poff and Barrett included legal and procedural deficiencies which were ‘so inconsistent with the legal standards of the period and so objectively unsatisfactory and unfair, that they render the conviction unsafe.” This is the fourth occasion that a posthumous Presidential Pardon could be awarded. The first posthumous Presidential Pardon was awarded by President Higgins to Harry Gleeson in 2015. The second posthumous Presidential Pardon, and the first to be granted for events which occurred prior to the formation of the State, was granted to Myles Joyce in April 2018, who was executed having been found guilty of involvement in the Maamtrasna murders in 1882. The third posthumous pardon was awarded to John Twiss in 2021.

It cannot stand that on any social media platform or anywhere else that somebody can brazenly come forward and threaten to take your life and somehow imagine that that is acceptable or okay or part of a political conversation.

The video has since been shared by various other accounts on different platforms. Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast on Thursday morning, the day after she publicly condemned the video, McDonald said the threat against her “speaks to something much wider in our society, and is frightening.” The Sinn Féin leader said that in her role, she understands that she is susceptible to commentary and criticism, but that “every line has been now crossed” with this week\'s online threat. “This is just the latest escalation in something that I think is really dangerous, generally, and that I know has been very deliberately targeted at me, and I’m sick of it. “I hadn’t said much publicly throughout this year about what was going on, but once there is a direct threat made - openly, brazenly broadcast on social media - that a person will shoot you, that they will take your life, and that they feel comfortable saying that, broadcasting it, and announcing it to the world, clearly that puts you in the way of greater danger, and I found that frightening.” McDonald said she chose to speak out after the threat in terms of her “own personal security"" and also because “it is not on.” “It’s me this time,"" McDonald said. ""It could be anybody else. ""It is not acceptable in our society that people feel at liberty to throw their weight around like that and threaten to kill democratically elected politicians - or, by the way, anybody else.” McDonald, who noted that the matter was being investigated by Gardaí, said that “there have to be consequences for these kind of actions,” adding that “it’s not because I’m some sort of special category of person. I’m an equal citizen in this society and my safety is on an equal par with everybody else\'s.” Regarding the person who made the online threat, McDonald said: “The person who issued this threat against me spoke also about the issues around immigration and protest. He is part of that small section of Irish society that has chosen to be toxic and violent and disorderly and hateful, and they have to be faced down. “And, at the same time, the wider section of many communities who are not racist and hateful and all of those things but who are concerned and have not been engaged properly, who don’t have confidence in the way in which immigration, in particular, is being managed at this time - we need to engage that section of the population and talk and listen, and listen and talk, and lead.” McDonald went on to say that the TikTok video with the threat against her and Harris should not have been permitted to remain live for so long. After the arrest, RTÉ News reported on Thursday the video which was originally posted on TikTok has now been taken down from that platform but remains in circulation on Facebook and X. TikTok said on Thursday afternoon that the video violated its community guidelines which prohibit violent threats and incitement. It also said the content had been removed from its platform and the account banned. Meta also claimed the video had been removed from Facebook, but RTÉ reported that they were still able to access it through the site and it is also widely available on other social media platforms. IrishCentral was also easily able to find the video on X and Facebook on Thursday afternoon, though it had been shared by accounts slamming the man and his threats. RTÉ News added that neither TikTok nor Meta would say how long the video was on their platforms, why it was not taken down immediately, if they were cooperating with the garda investigation, or whether their content moderation and security procedures have proven to be extremely weak in this case. Both social media companies claim they do not allow violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities but gardaí say criminal gangs use these social media platforms for organised crime activity.']",garda - man - video - dublin - drew - abuse - sexual - inquiry - mcgreevy - threat,0.8124868455213538,False

Security sources, however, told the Irish Examiner that the man is not believed to have the ""capacity"" to carry out the threats he made, but they are concerned the video, which has been widely circulated across social media platforms, could influence other individuals.

He goes on to describe Garda Commissioner Drew Harris as a ""prick"" and encourages viewers to ""Take his whole throat, lads. Take Drew Harris\'s throat off."" He added: ""F--- Drew Harris. He\'ll be getting shot. He\'ll be getting f---ing blasted, I swear to god on that. He\'ll be getting shot before the end of the year."" He continued: ""And see Mary Lou? I\'ll shoot her meself for free, I will, yeah. I\'ll do her for f---ing free, I will, yeah. ""F---ing little rats."" The man concludes his video by saying ""Gavin Pepper for f---ing President.

The video has since been shared by various other accounts on different platforms. Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast on Thursday morning, the day after she publicly condemned the video, McDonald said the threat against her “speaks to something much wider in our society, and is frightening.” The Sinn Féin leader said that in her role, she understands that she is susceptible to commentary and criticism, but that “every line has been now crossed” with this week\'s online threat. “This is just the latest escalation in something that I think is really dangerous, generally, and that I know has been very deliberately targeted at me, and I’m sick of it. “I hadn’t said much publicly throughout this year about what was going on, but once there is a direct threat made - openly, brazenly broadcast on social media - that a person will shoot you, that they will take your life, and that they feel comfortable saying that, broadcasting it, and announcing it to the world, clearly that puts you in the way of greater danger, and I found that frightening.” McDonald said she chose to speak out after the threat in terms of her “own personal security"" and also because “it is not on.” “It’s me this time,"" McDonald said. ""It could be anybody else. ""It is not acceptable in our society that people feel at liberty to throw their weight around like that and threaten to kill democratically elected politicians - or, by the way, anybody else.” McDonald, who noted that the matter was being investigated by Gardaí, said that “there have to be consequences for these kind of actions,” adding that “it’s not because I’m some sort of special category of person. I’m an equal citizen in this society and my safety is on an equal par with everybody else\'s.” Regarding the person who made the online threat, McDonald said: “The person who issued this threat against me spoke also about the issues around immigration and protest. He is part of that small section of Irish society that has chosen to be toxic and violent and disorderly and hateful, and they have to be faced down. “And, at the same time, the wider section of many communities who are not racist and hateful and all of those things but who are concerned and have not been engaged properly, who don’t have confidence in the way in which immigration, in particular, is being managed at this time - we need to engage that section of the population and talk and listen, and listen and talk, and lead.” McDonald went on to say that the TikTok video with the threat against her and Harris should not have been permitted to remain live for so long. After the arrest, RTÉ News reported on Thursday the video which was originally posted on TikTok has now been taken down from that platform but remains in circulation on Facebook and X. TikTok said on Thursday afternoon that the video violated its community guidelines which prohibit violent threats and incitement. It also said the content had been removed from its platform and the account banned. Meta also claimed the video had been removed from Facebook, but RTÉ reported that they were still able to access it through the site and it is also widely available on other social media platforms. IrishCentral was also easily able to find the video on X and Facebook on Thursday afternoon, though it had been shared by accounts slamming the man and his threats. RTÉ News added that neither TikTok nor Meta would say how long the video was on their platforms, why it was not taken down immediately, if they were cooperating with the garda investigation, or whether their content moderation and security procedures have proven to be extremely weak in this case. Both social media companies claim they do not allow violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities but gardaí say criminal gangs use these social media platforms for organised crime activity.']",garda - man - video - dublin - drew - abuse - sexual - inquiry - mcgreevy - threat,1.0,True

TD Mary Lou McDonald, the President of Sinn Féin and leader of Ireland’s opposition party, has spoken out about a death threat that was made against her online yesterday, July 16. “Last night a threat to kill me was issued online. The individual said he would shoot me dead,” McDonald said on social media on Wednesday. “This represents an escalation of targeted online abuse directed at me over the last year. It is totally unacceptable. “I have reported this to An Garda Síochána. “Ironically, this threat was made while I was hosting a discussion on the need for zero tolerance when it comes to violence against women and girls.” Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, McDonald further said the campaign against her has been “vicious, it has been sexist, misogynistic, it has been racist, and it’s also politically contrived to cause a problem between me and the working class communities that we represent.” McDonald said she is “satisfied” that Gardai are going to handle the threat. “But this cannot stand. It cannot stand that on any social media platform or anywhere else that somebody can brazenly come forward and threaten to take your life and somehow imagine that that is acceptable or okay or part of a political conversation. It’s not.” She added: “I’m no shrinking violet. I’m not a bit precious about people making all manner of commentary, but I’m drawing the line. I’ve had enough of it, quite frankly.” While she admitted she is “upset” about the threat, McDonald said: “It’s clearly not going to put me off doing my job and carrying out my democratic function and representing people to the best of my ability.” This death threat is an escalation in a vicious, sexist, misogynistic, racist campaign against me that has been ongoing for over a year and that has been politically contrived to cause problems between me and the working class communities we in Sinn Féin represent.

TD Mary Lou McDonald, the President of Sinn Féin and leader of Ireland’s opposition party, has spoken out about a death threat that was made against her online yesterday, July 16. “Last night a threat to kill me was issued online. The individual said he would shoot me dead,” McDonald said on social media on Wednesday. “This represents an escalation of targeted online abuse directed at me over the last year. It is totally unacceptable. “I have reported this to An Garda Síochána. “Ironically, this threat was made while I was hosting a discussion on the need for zero tolerance when it comes to violence against women and girls.” Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, McDonald further said the campaign against her has been “vicious, it has been sexist, misogynistic, it has been racist, and it’s also politically contrived to cause a problem between me and the working class communities that we represent.” McDonald said she is “satisfied” that Gardai are going to handle the threat. “But this cannot stand. It cannot stand that on any social media platform or anywhere else that somebody can brazenly come forward and threaten to take your life and somehow imagine that that is acceptable or okay or part of a political conversation. It’s not.” She added: “I’m no shrinking violet. I’m not a bit precious about people making all manner of commentary, but I’m drawing the line. I’ve had enough of it, quite frankly.” While she admitted she is “upset” about the threat, McDonald said: “It’s clearly not going to put me off doing my job and carrying out my democratic function and representing people to the best of my ability.” This death threat is an escalation in a vicious, sexist, misogynistic, racist campaign against me that has been ongoing for over a year and that has been politically contrived to cause problems between me and the working class communities we in Sinn Féin represent.

A Garda spokesperson told the Irish Examiner: ""An Garda Síochána is aware of footage posted to social media on Tuesday, 16th July 2024. ""An Garda Síochána is investigating this matter."" In a separate statement earlier on Wednesday, An Garda Síochána said it was continuing a criminal investigation into all of the circumstances of the Violent Disorder and Public Order events that occurred on Monday. An incident room has been established at Coolock Garda Station and a Senior Investigating Officer has been appointed. An Garda Síochána said it is in the process of collating and harvesting CCTV and social media images from the events on Monday. An Garda Síochána acknowledged the significant volume of support received from the public to date including calls to Coolock Garda Station, the Garda Confidential phone number and receipt of images and videos from members of the public. An Garda Síochána appealed to anyone who may have witnessed these incidents to come forward. Any road users with camera footage (including dash-cam) who were on the Malahide Road or surrounding areas on Monday between 9 am and 8 pm are asked to make this footage available to Gardaí.

A man has been arrested in Dublin after a heinous video was posted online this week explicitly threatening President of Sinn Féin TD Mary Lou McDonald and Garda Commissioner Drew Harris. “Gardaí have arrested a man in his 20s as part of their investigation,” a spokesperson for An Garda Síochána told IrishCentral on Thursday afternoon. “The man is currently detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 at a Garda Station in the DMR [Dublin Metropolitan Region].” The Special Detective Unit arrested the man in south Dublin during a search of his home, according to the Irish Examiner, which added that the man was arrested on suspicion of making threats to kill or cause serious harm under Section 5 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. Multiple outlets reported on Thursday that the man who was arrested is known to Gardaí. Security sources, however, told the Irish Examiner that the man is not believed to have the ""capacity"" to carry out the threats he made, but they are concerned the video, which has been widely circulated across social media platforms, could influence other individuals.

The video has since been shared by various other accounts on different platforms. Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast on Thursday morning, the day after she publicly condemned the video, McDonald said the threat against her “speaks to something much wider in our society, and is frightening.” The Sinn Féin leader said that in her role, she understands that she is susceptible to commentary and criticism, but that “every line has been now crossed” with this week\'s online threat. “This is just the latest escalation in something that I think is really dangerous, generally, and that I know has been very deliberately targeted at me, and I’m sick of it. “I hadn’t said much publicly throughout this year about what was going on, but once there is a direct threat made - openly, brazenly broadcast on social media - that a person will shoot you, that they will take your life, and that they feel comfortable saying that, broadcasting it, and announcing it to the world, clearly that puts you in the way of greater danger, and I found that frightening.” McDonald said she chose to speak out after the threat in terms of her “own personal security"" and also because “it is not on.” “It’s me this time,"" McDonald said. ""It could be anybody else. ""It is not acceptable in our society that people feel at liberty to throw their weight around like that and threaten to kill democratically elected politicians - or, by the way, anybody else.” McDonald, who noted that the matter was being investigated by Gardaí, said that “there have to be consequences for these kind of actions,” adding that “it’s not because I’m some sort of special category of person. I’m an equal citizen in this society and my safety is on an equal par with everybody else\'s.” Regarding the person who made the online threat, McDonald said: “The person who issued this threat against me spoke also about the issues around immigration and protest. He is part of that small section of Irish society that has chosen to be toxic and violent and disorderly and hateful, and they have to be faced down. “And, at the same time, the wider section of many communities who are not racist and hateful and all of those things but who are concerned and have not been engaged properly, who don’t have confidence in the way in which immigration, in particular, is being managed at this time - we need to engage that section of the population and talk and listen, and listen and talk, and lead.” McDonald went on to say that the TikTok video with the threat against her and Harris should not have been permitted to remain live for so long. After the arrest, RTÉ News reported on Thursday the video which was originally posted on TikTok has now been taken down from that platform but remains in circulation on Facebook and X. TikTok said on Thursday afternoon that the video violated its community guidelines which prohibit violent threats and incitement. It also said the content had been removed from its platform and the account banned. Meta also claimed the video had been removed from Facebook, but RTÉ reported that they were still able to access it through the site and it is also widely available on other social media platforms. IrishCentral was also easily able to find the video on X and Facebook on Thursday afternoon, though it had been shared by accounts slamming the man and his threats. RTÉ News added that neither TikTok nor Meta would say how long the video was on their platforms, why it was not taken down immediately, if they were cooperating with the garda investigation, or whether their content moderation and security procedures have proven to be extremely weak in this case. Both social media companies claim they do not allow violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities but gardaí say criminal gangs use these social media platforms for organised crime activity.']",garda - man - video - dublin - drew - abuse - sexual - inquiry - mcgreevy - threat,0.8560389739243928,True
"On Irish Border poll, new British Prime Minister is ""committed to the Good Friday Agreement"" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in Belfast that the UK government's role in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and an Irish border poll is an ""honest broker."" Keir Starmer addressed the potential of a Border poll while in Northern Ireland on Monday, July 8 as part of a tour of the UK after being elected as the new British Prime Minister last Thursday. “This is provided for by the Good Friday Agreement,” Starmer told reporters at Government Buildings in Belfast on Monday when asked about a potential Border poll. “The framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement. “Today is a recommitment to that and to the approach and the role of the UK government and that is the honest broker. “I am Prime Minister for the whole of the UK, elected into office just a few days ago. “But to reaffirm the importance of the principles of the Good Friday Agreement is part and parcel of why I am here today.” Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Starmer was elected the new British Prime Minister following Thursday's General Election across the United Kingdom. His Labour party clinched what is being described as a ""landslide"" victory over Conservatives, who had been in power for more than a decade. In October last year, Starmer said an Irish border poll is ""absolutely hypothetical"" and ""not even on the horizon."" He had previously said that he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK if a referendum is held during his lifetime, stating that he would ""make the case for the United Kingdom."" Starmer's comments in October drew some criticism from academics and pro-unity groups in Northern Ireland, but he appeared to offer a more diplomatic response on Monday in Belfast. As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland's Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" On Saturday, Northern Ireland's new Secretary of State Hillary Benn, also a member of the UK Labour Party, told reporters in Belfast that believes ""there is no evidence that that condition has been met"" to call a border poll, adding that he is ""not going to set out further criteria because there is the one criteria."" Meanwhile, Sinn Féin, Ireland's all-island nationalist party that campaigns on Irish unity, emerged as the biggest Northern Ireland party after last week's UK General Election. Of the 18 Westminster seats that were up for grabs in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin won the most, seven. The Democratic Unionist Party won five, the SDLP won two, and the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice, and an Independent each won one seat. (Sinn Féin, however, maintains a longstanding policy of not taking their seats in British Parliament, in part because it would require them to swear allegiance to the monarchy.) In its manifesto for the UK General Election, Sinn Féin said in part: ""The Irish and British governments must set a date for a referendum on Irish unity."" On Monday in Belfast, Starmer met with a Sinn Féin delegation that included Michelle O'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and the vice president of the party, and Mary Lou McDonald, the party's president. O'Neill described Sinn Féin's engagements with Starmer on Monday as ""productive."" Our Sinn Féin delegation held a productive meeting with the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer.

Two things I never do at the start of a New Year: predictions and resolutions. Resolutions fall by the wayside as old habits regroup. Predictions never fully pan out. The unexpected can and will happen. Choices will have unforeseen consequences. And 2024 will be a year of choices that will define the coming years. This year will likely see general elections in Britain and the South of Ireland. I say likely, as both the British and Irish Governments have home team advantage in terms of setting an election date. Elections must be held before the Spring of 2025. Neither are likely to plan an election in the first months of next year. There are also elections set for June in the South of Ireland for local councils and the EU Parliament. The Irish Government is also planning to hold a referendum to amend an archaic constitutional definition of the role of women in the home. Their replacement wording, which was leaked to the media, has failed to inspire and will no doubt be contested. Under referendum rules, equal time and support have to be given to both sides of the constitutional plebiscite. This is also an election year in the US. By the end of the year, there could be new Irish and British Governments, significant changes in the EU parliament and Commission, and changes in both houses of Congress and the Administration. All of these choices are in the hands of the people. Those choices will have fundamental impacts on Ireland, Anglo-Irish relations, and Irish-American relations as well as the wider European and global community. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The coming Irish general election could be historic. Last time out, Sinn Féin emerged as the largest party. A position that they have consolidated. Until then, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had controlled both government and opposition since the foundation of the state. Following that election, both entered government as part of a coalition with the Green party. Their common policy objective was to keep Sinn Féin out. Mary Lou McDonald became the first woman and the first Sinn Féin president to lead the official opposition. Since then, support for the party has grown. The Sinn Féin president has not hidden the party\'s ambition to lead a government, preferably without Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In doing so, she would become the first woman to be Taoiseach in the first Sinn Féin-led government. It would be an opportunity to break from the past. The party is also confident in gaining ground in the local and European elections in the South. The European parliamentary elections are held on the same week across the member states. There has been a rise of reactionary right-wing parties in Italy, Holland, and Germany. The EU faces continued challenges with the war in Ukraine, a lack of consensus on a ceasefire in the siege of Gaza, and expansion plans with additional states wishing to join. It remains to be seen how these elections will pan out. The parliament and commission are facing significant strategic challenges that will define the EU project for decades to come. One thing is for certain, Britain will not have a say. As a consequence of the choice of Brexit, they have left the Parliament and Commission. The British Labour Party has maintained a significant lead over the governing Tory Party. It has been 12 years since the last Labour Government. Given the extent of the Labour Party\'s lead and the daily scandals and dysfunctions of the current government, it seems that Labour is well-placed to win. This has led to the Labour Leader, Keir Starmer taking conservative and cautious positions on most issues. The party appears to rely on voters\' opposition to the Tories more than articulating what the Labour Party stands for. It remains to be seen what difference a Labour-led government will make with regards to policy in Ireland and the EU. One of the first things to land on the new Prime Minister\'s desk will be defending the current British government\'s Legacy Legislation in the European Court of Human Rights. The outgoing government passed the law that ends police and police ombudsman investigations into actions during the conflict. It blocks the right to inquests and access to the courts for those bereaved. It has been opposed by the victims, all parties in Ireland, and human rights organizations. It was also opposed by the British Labour Party in Westminster. Just before Christmas, the Irish Government initiated an inter-state case against the British Government\'s Legacy law in the European Courts. It is expected that the case will be heard within the next two years. The choice facing Keir Starmer will be to defend in government a law that is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement and that he opposed or stand by his word and revoke the law and return to the existing governmental and cross-party Stormont House Agreement. The election calculations will be playing out within the Democratic Unionist Party. They have seats at Westminster to defend at a time when they block government formation in the North and possible changes of governments in London and Dublin. Despite its grand title, the largest unionist party has a selective approach to democracy. 18 months ago, the vast majority of voters supported a return to government in Stormont. Sinn Féin became the largest party in the jurisdiction and Michelle O’Neill the First Minister-elect. The DUP has refused to respect these results and continues to block the government. It appears that sharing power with an Irish Republican First Minister is a step too far for some elements of their party. The DUP are masters at only making a decision when they absolutely have to; when the alternative to doing nothing comes at a cost to their party. Over the past 18 months, they have been facilitated by the British Government. The cost has been paid by the public, the economy, and confidence in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP has not moved despite a change in presentation. The party made infamous for saying “no” has presented itself over the past 18 months as the party of “no, but maybe."" It is well past decision time for the DUP. The two outgoing governments should now set out how North/South and the devolved institutions will be operated, and the Agreement protected in the absence of the DUP and a functioning Executive. The DUP will do what the DUP will do. It is up to either the outgoing or incoming governments to progress the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Regardless of the election outcomes, the case for Irish Unity continues. The genie is out of the bottle, the debate is now live in homes, academia, and the legal, arts, and business communities. It is an exciting time. A Sinn Féin-led government in Dublin will prepare, plan, and advocate for unity. A Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government may continue to prevaricate. The election outcome may accelerate or slow the progress, but it cannot be stopped. An Irish government planning and preparing for unity is a constitutional and political imperative. Everyone agrees that referendums are coming. The sensible thing to do would be to plan and prepare. An Irish Government leading on the issue would be a game changer north and south, between Britain and Ireland and internationally. Unity referendums, the right of the people who share the island to define their constitutional future, are a foundation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not a point of contention. It is part of the agreement and a settled matter. It binds the British Government to act with rigorous impartiality in the discussion and to act on the outcome of the referendums. The discussions will continue to grow across Ireland and the US. In a world in which the international order has broken down, Ireland and our peace process can continue to act as a beacon of hope. Managing the process of change is a crucial challenge to the incoming governments. Honoring agreements and laws, respecting democracy, and vindicating rights remain the means to assert the primacy of politics over conflict. That has been the lesson of the Irish Peace Process. The current impasse can and will be overcome when governments return to those principles. This year will be a year of choices for people and governments. I cannot predict what the end of the year will look like, but I hope those in power remember the lessons of the past and commit to a better future for all. I am confident that whatever the outcome of the elections in the US, Ireland will continue to have a partner for peace. *Ciarán Quinn is Sinn Fein representative to US.', 'On Irish Border poll, new British Prime Minister is ""committed to the Good Friday Agreement"" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in Belfast that the UK government\'s role in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and an Irish border poll is an ""honest broker.""

McDonald noted while on Sky News that for the first time ever, Sinn Féin is the largest party in Northern Ireland and holds the office of First Minister.

The scheme is designed to boost outdoor recreation and rural tourism in Ireland and is a key element of ""Embracing Ireland\'s Outdoors"" - the Irish Government\'s Outdoor Recreation Strategy. The National Walks Scheme provides funding to farmers and other landholders to maintain trails that pass through their land, with over €15 million paid to farmers and landholders since the scheme was launched in 2017. The Government has spent a further €1.4 million on materials and maintenance of the trails. The latest expansion will see an additional annual investment of over €500,000 to rural areas through the scheme. The highlights of the latest expansion include a walking trail at the majestic Devils\' Chimney in County Sligo and a trail at the Ardmore Cliff Walk in County Waterford.

Mayfair Library, a €7.2 million project funded by Kilkenny County Council and the Department of Rural and Local Development, has been transformed from an old ballroom into a state-of-the-art library and community facility as part of the development. Located in the heart of medieval Kilkenny, the library features digital spaces for training and innovation, providing access to 3D printers, 3D scanners, and sewing machines. It also features space for workshops, lectures, training, and community engagement events. Humphreys, who toured the new library, has announced that the additional investment of €25 million will create 11 new public libraries and 12 Next Generation mobile library vehicles, representing one of the most significant investments in Irish library services in recent years.

"""They saved his life"" - Mary Lou McDonald’s husband diagnosed with cancer after airport collapse Mary Lou McDonald has opened up about her husband’s cancer diagnosis, which they learned after she was recovering from a hysterectomy. The Sinn Féin leader has had what she described as an ""eventful"" year, with her burying her father just over a month ago, her undergoing a hysterectomy last September, and her husband Martin Lanigan falling extremely ill when they were set to head home from holiday in Biarritz. Revealing her husband’s diagnosis on Thursday, Ms McDonald said that she and her family went for a small holiday in the south of France while she was recovering — with Martin falling ill while they were heading to the airport. ""Literally between packing the case to come home and arriving at the airport, Martin got really really sick,"" Ms McDonald said on Ireland AM. ""I didn’t know what it was, but I knew it was serious because he is the type of Irish man who it wouldn’t matter what was wrong. He would say 'sure I’m grand, everything’s grand.' But he wasn’t okay."" A post shared by Ireland AM (@irelandamvmtv) Thankfully for Ms McDonald and Martin, an Irish nurse who was heading to London aided him and suggested he go to hospital, where they learned that his bowel had burst. ""They saved his life,"" she said. ""His bowels had burst."" After undergoing surgery for his burst bowel, he learned that there was a tumor — which led to him being diagnosed with colorectal cancer, with Ms McDonald and Martin staying in the Basque region. ""So I ended up spending several weeks in the Basque country in France, with him in intensive care and hospital, and all of the thing of him getting home and the worry of would I get him home?"" she explained. ""It was one of those moments in life where literally everything got turned upside down."" Despite going through her own hysterectomy recovery, Ms McDonald said that her main priority became her husband’s recovery from cancer — with her admitting that she didn’t go public as she was still processing the diagnosis. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! ""I hadn’t spoken about it. I haven’t spoken about it really publicly at all because I was still trying to process it,"" she said. ""[I was thinking] 'what does this mean? How serious is this? Will he recover?' ""Anybody that knows it, knows a cancer diagnosis is a game changer for the individual but also for the family. And that was the case for our family. I’m talking about it now because he is one of the lucky ones, and his prognosis is good and for that, I am eternally, eternally grateful."" Ms McDonald also spoke about the recent passing of her father, admitting that while she had a complicated relationship with her father, she still loved him. ""We buried our father five weeks ago. So anybody who has lost their Da knows that’s a very hard thing,"" Ms McDonald said. ""I loved my Da, but we had a complicated relationship. ""He was a complicated person. My parents have been separated for most of my life. So it’s kind of a strange thing.

Two things I never do at the start of a New Year: predictions and resolutions. Resolutions fall by the wayside as old habits regroup. Predictions never fully pan out. The unexpected can and will happen. Choices will have unforeseen consequences. And 2024 will be a year of choices that will define the coming years. This year will likely see general elections in Britain and the South of Ireland. I say likely, as both the British and Irish Governments have home team advantage in terms of setting an election date. Elections must be held before the Spring of 2025. Neither are likely to plan an election in the first months of next year. There are also elections set for June in the South of Ireland for local councils and the EU Parliament. The Irish Government is also planning to hold a referendum to amend an archaic constitutional definition of the role of women in the home. Their replacement wording, which was leaked to the media, has failed to inspire and will no doubt be contested. Under referendum rules, equal time and support have to be given to both sides of the constitutional plebiscite. This is also an election year in the US. By the end of the year, there could be new Irish and British Governments, significant changes in the EU parliament and Commission, and changes in both houses of Congress and the Administration. All of these choices are in the hands of the people. Those choices will have fundamental impacts on Ireland, Anglo-Irish relations, and Irish-American relations as well as the wider European and global community. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The coming Irish general election could be historic. Last time out, Sinn Féin emerged as the largest party. A position that they have consolidated. Until then, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had controlled both government and opposition since the foundation of the state. Following that election, both entered government as part of a coalition with the Green party. Their common policy objective was to keep Sinn Féin out. Mary Lou McDonald became the first woman and the first Sinn Féin president to lead the official opposition. Since then, support for the party has grown. The Sinn Féin president has not hidden the party\'s ambition to lead a government, preferably without Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In doing so, she would become the first woman to be Taoiseach in the first Sinn Féin-led government. It would be an opportunity to break from the past. The party is also confident in gaining ground in the local and European elections in the South. The European parliamentary elections are held on the same week across the member states. There has been a rise of reactionary right-wing parties in Italy, Holland, and Germany. The EU faces continued challenges with the war in Ukraine, a lack of consensus on a ceasefire in the siege of Gaza, and expansion plans with additional states wishing to join. It remains to be seen how these elections will pan out. The parliament and commission are facing significant strategic challenges that will define the EU project for decades to come. One thing is for certain, Britain will not have a say. As a consequence of the choice of Brexit, they have left the Parliament and Commission. The British Labour Party has maintained a significant lead over the governing Tory Party. It has been 12 years since the last Labour Government. Given the extent of the Labour Party\'s lead and the daily scandals and dysfunctions of the current government, it seems that Labour is well-placed to win. This has led to the Labour Leader, Keir Starmer taking conservative and cautious positions on most issues. The party appears to rely on voters\' opposition to the Tories more than articulating what the Labour Party stands for. It remains to be seen what difference a Labour-led government will make with regards to policy in Ireland and the EU. One of the first things to land on the new Prime Minister\'s desk will be defending the current British government\'s Legacy Legislation in the European Court of Human Rights. The outgoing government passed the law that ends police and police ombudsman investigations into actions during the conflict. It blocks the right to inquests and access to the courts for those bereaved. It has been opposed by the victims, all parties in Ireland, and human rights organizations. It was also opposed by the British Labour Party in Westminster. Just before Christmas, the Irish Government initiated an inter-state case against the British Government\'s Legacy law in the European Courts. It is expected that the case will be heard within the next two years. The choice facing Keir Starmer will be to defend in government a law that is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement and that he opposed or stand by his word and revoke the law and return to the existing governmental and cross-party Stormont House Agreement. The election calculations will be playing out within the Democratic Unionist Party. They have seats at Westminster to defend at a time when they block government formation in the North and possible changes of governments in London and Dublin. Despite its grand title, the largest unionist party has a selective approach to democracy. 18 months ago, the vast majority of voters supported a return to government in Stormont. Sinn Féin became the largest party in the jurisdiction and Michelle O’Neill the First Minister-elect. The DUP has refused to respect these results and continues to block the government. It appears that sharing power with an Irish Republican First Minister is a step too far for some elements of their party. The DUP are masters at only making a decision when they absolutely have to; when the alternative to doing nothing comes at a cost to their party. Over the past 18 months, they have been facilitated by the British Government. The cost has been paid by the public, the economy, and confidence in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP has not moved despite a change in presentation. The party made infamous for saying “no” has presented itself over the past 18 months as the party of “no, but maybe."" It is well past decision time for the DUP. The two outgoing governments should now set out how North/South and the devolved institutions will be operated, and the Agreement protected in the absence of the DUP and a functioning Executive. The DUP will do what the DUP will do. It is up to either the outgoing or incoming governments to progress the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Regardless of the election outcomes, the case for Irish Unity continues. The genie is out of the bottle, the debate is now live in homes, academia, and the legal, arts, and business communities. It is an exciting time. A Sinn Féin-led government in Dublin will prepare, plan, and advocate for unity. A Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government may continue to prevaricate. The election outcome may accelerate or slow the progress, but it cannot be stopped. An Irish government planning and preparing for unity is a constitutional and political imperative. Everyone agrees that referendums are coming. The sensible thing to do would be to plan and prepare. An Irish Government leading on the issue would be a game changer north and south, between Britain and Ireland and internationally. Unity referendums, the right of the people who share the island to define their constitutional future, are a foundation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not a point of contention. It is part of the agreement and a settled matter. It binds the British Government to act with rigorous impartiality in the discussion and to act on the outcome of the referendums. The discussions will continue to grow across Ireland and the US. In a world in which the international order has broken down, Ireland and our peace process can continue to act as a beacon of hope. Managing the process of change is a crucial challenge to the incoming governments. Honoring agreements and laws, respecting democracy, and vindicating rights remain the means to assert the primacy of politics over conflict. That has been the lesson of the Irish Peace Process. The current impasse can and will be overcome when governments return to those principles. This year will be a year of choices for people and governments. I cannot predict what the end of the year will look like, but I hope those in power remember the lessons of the past and commit to a better future for all. I am confident that whatever the outcome of the elections in the US, Ireland will continue to have a partner for peace. *Ciarán Quinn is Sinn Fein representative to US.', 'On Irish Border poll, new British Prime Minister is ""committed to the Good Friday Agreement"" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in Belfast that the UK government\'s role in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and an Irish border poll is an ""honest broker."" Keir Starmer addressed the potential of a Border poll while in Northern Ireland on Monday, July 8 as part of a tour of the UK after being elected as the new British Prime Minister last Thursday. “This is provided for by the Good Friday Agreement,” Starmer told reporters at Government Buildings in Belfast on Monday when asked about a potential Border poll. “The framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement. “Today is a recommitment to that and to the approach and the role of the UK government and that is the honest broker. “I am Prime Minister for the whole of the UK, elected into office just a few days ago. “But to reaffirm the importance of the principles of the Good Friday Agreement is part and parcel of why I am here today.” Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Starmer was elected the new British Prime Minister following Thursday\'s General Election across the United Kingdom. His Labour party clinched what is being described as a ""landslide"" victory over Conservatives, who had been in power for more than a decade. In October last year, Starmer said an Irish border poll is ""absolutely hypothetical"" and ""not even on the horizon."" He had previously said that he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK if a referendum is held during his lifetime, stating that he would ""make the case for the United Kingdom."" Starmer\'s comments in October drew some criticism from academics and pro-unity groups in Northern Ireland, but he appeared to offer a more diplomatic response on Monday in Belfast. As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" On Saturday, Northern Ireland\'s new Secretary of State Hillary Benn, also a member of the UK Labour Party, told reporters in Belfast that believes ""there is no evidence that that condition has been met"" to call a border poll, adding that he is ""not going to set out further criteria because there is the one criteria."" Meanwhile, Sinn Féin, Ireland\'s all-island nationalist party that campaigns on Irish unity, emerged as the biggest Northern Ireland party after last week\'s UK General Election. Of the 18 Westminster seats that were up for grabs in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin won the most, seven. The Democratic Unionist Party won five, the SDLP won two, and the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice, and an Independent each won one seat. (Sinn Féin, however, maintains a longstanding policy of not taking their seats in British Parliament, in part because it would require them to swear allegiance to the monarchy.) In its manifesto for the UK General Election, Sinn Féin said in part: ""The Irish and British governments must set a date for a referendum on Irish unity."" On Monday in Belfast, Starmer met with a Sinn Féin delegation that included Michelle O\'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and the vice president of the party, and Mary Lou McDonald, the party\'s president.

Two things I never do at the start of a New Year: predictions and resolutions. Resolutions fall by the wayside as old habits regroup. Predictions never fully pan out. The unexpected can and will happen. Choices will have unforeseen consequences. And 2024 will be a year of choices that will define the coming years. This year will likely see general elections in Britain and the South of Ireland. I say likely, as both the British and Irish Governments have home team advantage in terms of setting an election date. Elections must be held before the Spring of 2025. Neither are likely to plan an election in the first months of next year. There are also elections set for June in the South of Ireland for local councils and the EU Parliament. The Irish Government is also planning to hold a referendum to amend an archaic constitutional definition of the role of women in the home. Their replacement wording, which was leaked to the media, has failed to inspire and will no doubt be contested. Under referendum rules, equal time and support have to be given to both sides of the constitutional plebiscite. This is also an election year in the US. By the end of the year, there could be new Irish and British Governments, significant changes in the EU parliament and Commission, and changes in both houses of Congress and the Administration. All of these choices are in the hands of the people. Those choices will have fundamental impacts on Ireland, Anglo-Irish relations, and Irish-American relations as well as the wider European and global community. Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The coming Irish general election could be historic. Last time out, Sinn Féin emerged as the largest party. A position that they have consolidated. Until then, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had controlled both government and opposition since the foundation of the state. Following that election, both entered government as part of a coalition with the Green party. Their common policy objective was to keep Sinn Féin out. Mary Lou McDonald became the first woman and the first Sinn Féin president to lead the official opposition. Since then, support for the party has grown. The Sinn Féin president has not hidden the party\'s ambition to lead a government, preferably without Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. In doing so, she would become the first woman to be Taoiseach in the first Sinn Féin-led government. It would be an opportunity to break from the past. The party is also confident in gaining ground in the local and European elections in the South. The European parliamentary elections are held on the same week across the member states. There has been a rise of reactionary right-wing parties in Italy, Holland, and Germany. The EU faces continued challenges with the war in Ukraine, a lack of consensus on a ceasefire in the siege of Gaza, and expansion plans with additional states wishing to join. It remains to be seen how these elections will pan out. The parliament and commission are facing significant strategic challenges that will define the EU project for decades to come. One thing is for certain, Britain will not have a say. As a consequence of the choice of Brexit, they have left the Parliament and Commission. The British Labour Party has maintained a significant lead over the governing Tory Party. It has been 12 years since the last Labour Government. Given the extent of the Labour Party\'s lead and the daily scandals and dysfunctions of the current government, it seems that Labour is well-placed to win. This has led to the Labour Leader, Keir Starmer taking conservative and cautious positions on most issues. The party appears to rely on voters\' opposition to the Tories more than articulating what the Labour Party stands for. It remains to be seen what difference a Labour-led government will make with regards to policy in Ireland and the EU. One of the first things to land on the new Prime Minister\'s desk will be defending the current British government\'s Legacy Legislation in the European Court of Human Rights. The outgoing government passed the law that ends police and police ombudsman investigations into actions during the conflict. It blocks the right to inquests and access to the courts for those bereaved. It has been opposed by the victims, all parties in Ireland, and human rights organizations. It was also opposed by the British Labour Party in Westminster. Just before Christmas, the Irish Government initiated an inter-state case against the British Government\'s Legacy law in the European Courts. It is expected that the case will be heard within the next two years. The choice facing Keir Starmer will be to defend in government a law that is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement and that he opposed or stand by his word and revoke the law and return to the existing governmental and cross-party Stormont House Agreement. The election calculations will be playing out within the Democratic Unionist Party. They have seats at Westminster to defend at a time when they block government formation in the North and possible changes of governments in London and Dublin. Despite its grand title, the largest unionist party has a selective approach to democracy. 18 months ago, the vast majority of voters supported a return to government in Stormont. Sinn Féin became the largest party in the jurisdiction and Michelle O’Neill the First Minister-elect. The DUP has refused to respect these results and continues to block the government. It appears that sharing power with an Irish Republican First Minister is a step too far for some elements of their party. The DUP are masters at only making a decision when they absolutely have to; when the alternative to doing nothing comes at a cost to their party. Over the past 18 months, they have been facilitated by the British Government. The cost has been paid by the public, the economy, and confidence in the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. The DUP has not moved despite a change in presentation. The party made infamous for saying “no” has presented itself over the past 18 months as the party of “no, but maybe."" It is well past decision time for the DUP. The two outgoing governments should now set out how North/South and the devolved institutions will be operated, and the Agreement protected in the absence of the DUP and a functioning Executive. The DUP will do what the DUP will do. It is up to either the outgoing or incoming governments to progress the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Regardless of the election outcomes, the case for Irish Unity continues. The genie is out of the bottle, the debate is now live in homes, academia, and the legal, arts, and business communities. It is an exciting time. A Sinn Féin-led government in Dublin will prepare, plan, and advocate for unity. A Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government may continue to prevaricate. The election outcome may accelerate or slow the progress, but it cannot be stopped. An Irish government planning and preparing for unity is a constitutional and political imperative. Everyone agrees that referendums are coming. The sensible thing to do would be to plan and prepare. An Irish Government leading on the issue would be a game changer north and south, between Britain and Ireland and internationally. Unity referendums, the right of the people who share the island to define their constitutional future, are a foundation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not a point of contention. It is part of the agreement and a settled matter. It binds the British Government to act with rigorous impartiality in the discussion and to act on the outcome of the referendums. The discussions will continue to grow across Ireland and the US. In a world in which the international order has broken down, Ireland and our peace process can continue to act as a beacon of hope. Managing the process of change is a crucial challenge to the incoming governments. Honoring agreements and laws, respecting democracy, and vindicating rights remain the means to assert the primacy of politics over conflict. That has been the lesson of the Irish Peace Process. The current impasse can and will be overcome when governments return to those principles. This year will be a year of choices for people and governments. I cannot predict what the end of the year will look like, but I hope those in power remember the lessons of the past and commit to a better future for all. I am confident that whatever the outcome of the elections in the US, Ireland will continue to have a partner for peace. *Ciarán Quinn is Sinn Fein representative to US.', 'On Irish Border poll, new British Prime Minister is ""committed to the Good Friday Agreement"" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in Belfast that the UK government\'s role in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and an Irish border poll is an ""honest broker."" Keir Starmer addressed the potential of a Border poll while in Northern Ireland on Monday, July 8 as part of a tour of the UK after being elected as the new British Prime Minister last Thursday. “This is provided for by the Good Friday Agreement,” Starmer told reporters at Government Buildings in Belfast on Monday when asked about a potential Border poll. “The framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement. “Today is a recommitment to that and to the approach and the role of the UK government and that is the honest broker. “I am Prime Minister for the whole of the UK, elected into office just a few days ago. “But to reaffirm the importance of the principles of the Good Friday Agreement is part and parcel of why I am here today.” Sign up to IrishCentral\'s newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Starmer was elected the new British Prime Minister following Thursday\'s General Election across the United Kingdom. His Labour party clinched what is being described as a ""landslide"" victory over Conservatives, who had been in power for more than a decade. In October last year, Starmer said an Irish border poll is ""absolutely hypothetical"" and ""not even on the horizon."" He had previously said that he would campaign for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK if a referendum is held during his lifetime, stating that he would ""make the case for the United Kingdom."" Starmer\'s comments in October drew some criticism from academics and pro-unity groups in Northern Ireland, but he appeared to offer a more diplomatic response on Monday in Belfast. As per the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland\'s Secretary of State has the power to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland."" On Saturday, Northern Ireland\'s new Secretary of State Hillary Benn, also a member of the UK Labour Party, told reporters in Belfast that believes ""there is no evidence that that condition has been met"" to call a border poll, adding that he is ""not going to set out further criteria because there is the one criteria."" Meanwhile, Sinn Féin, Ireland\'s all-island nationalist party that campaigns on Irish unity, emerged as the biggest Northern Ireland party after last week\'s UK General Election. Of the 18 Westminster seats that were up for grabs in Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin won the most, seven. The Democratic Unionist Party won five, the SDLP won two, and the Alliance Party, Ulster Unionist Party, Traditional Unionist Voice, and an Independent each won one seat. (Sinn Féin, however, maintains a longstanding policy of not taking their seats in British Parliament, in part because it would require them to swear allegiance to the monarchy.) In its manifesto for the UK General Election, Sinn Féin said in part: ""The Irish and British governments must set a date for a referendum on Irish unity."" On Monday in Belfast, Starmer met with a Sinn Féin delegation that included Michelle O\'Neill, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and the vice president of the party, and Mary Lou McDonald, the party\'s president. O\'Neill described Sinn Féin\'s engagements with Starmer on Monday as ""productive."" Our Sinn Féin delegation held a productive meeting with the new British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer.

"Ireland to ban ownership of XL Bully dogs from February Current XL Bully dog owners in Ireland will have time to apply for a certificate of exemption before the ban comes into effect. Ireland's Minister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys TD, has signed the Control of Dogs (XL Bully) Regulations 2024 that will introduce the ban on XL Bully type dogs in Ireland. The ban will come into force in two stages beginning on October 1, with a full ownership ban coming into force on February 1. The Department of Rural and Community Development said on Thursday, September 26 that the period between these two dates will allow current XL Bully dog owners time to apply for a Certificate of Exemption from their local authority to permit them to keep their dog until the end of its natural life There will be no fee for the certificate of exemption. Owners will be able to apply for a certificate of exemption from their local authority from October 1 subject to the dog being licensed, microchipped, neutered. Any owner found to be in breach of the regulations will have committed an offence under the Control of Dogs Act 1986. The dog may be seized and euthanized in a humane manner and the owner will be subject to the penalties outlined in that Act - a fine of up to €2,500, imprisonment of a term of up to three months, or both. The Department noted that following engagement with Animal Welfare charities and shelters, existing XL Bully dogs already in these facilities on October 1 will be permitted to be rehomed or exported subject to strict criteria until February 1. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Speaking after the cabinet meeting on Thursday, September 26, Minister Humphreys said: “I am bringing these regulations into force in the interest of public safety following a number of horrific attacks by XL Bully dogs, which included the death of a young woman in Limerick. ""The XL Bully type dog was also responsible for an attack on a very small child in Kerry last month and the horrific attack on Alejandro Mizsan in Wexford in 2022. ""I am concerned that if we do not take action now, the number of these dogs in the country will grow and my fear is that these attacks will become more frequent. “While I know not everybody will agree with the ban, my ultimate priority is to protect public safety. “For existing owners of XL Bully Dogs, provided they take the necessary steps and obtain a Certificate of Exemption, they will be permitted to keep their dog until the end of its natural life.” Today I have signed the regulations that will introduce a ban on the XL Bully.

Michael O’Donohue Memorial Project in bringing this case to my Department.” Johnnie Roche, Chairman of Castleisland District Heritage, shakes hands with Tomo Burke, great grandson of Sylvester... The 1880s in Ireland brought frequent agitation for land reform, which often developed into agrarian violence, with outrages pertaining to matters such as landlords, evictions, rent strikes, and boycotts, known as the Land War. In May 1882, the murders of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Chief Secretary, and his Under Secretary, T.H. Burke were carried out in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Referred to as the Phoenix Park Murders, they were the catalyst for the legislative response to the growing agrarian unrest. The Prevention of Crime (Ireland) Act 1882 (1882 Act) was a piece of coercive legislation passed in July 1882 in the aftermath of the Phoenix Park murders to clamp down on crimes such as “treason, murder, arson, attacks on dwelling-houses and crimes of aggravated violence.” Co Kerry and the area around Castleisland in particular, was experiencing a great deal of unrest and violence during this period. On October 3, 1882, Thomas Browne was murdered while working in one of his fields in Dromulton, near Scartaglin in Co Kerry. Two men in dark coats, seen from behind, shot him several times. Sylvester Poff and James Barrett, who did not match the descriptions of the assailants, were known to be in the vicinity at the time. The two men were arrested following a statement by a neighbour that they had seen them enter the field where Browne was shot. The prosecution case largely rested on the evidence of a neighbour, whose story changed as the case progressed and who could not be regarded as a reliable witness. Poff and Barrett were tried twice before special juries in Cork for the murder of Browne after the jury in the first trial failed to reach agreement on a verdict. Poff and Barrett were convicted of the murder of Browne in December 1882 and, despite petitions for mercy to the Lord Lieutenant, they were hanged in Tralee Gaol in January 1883. Dr. Niamh Howlin, an expert in 19th Century trial law and an Associate Professor in the Sutherland School of Law, UCD, was engaged by the Department of Justice to undertake an independent external review of the case and to advise upon the safety of the conviction or otherwise, with clear reference to the prevailing standards at the time. Dr. Howlin\'s examination concluded that a number of factors, including in the investigation and procedures around the trial, led her to form the opinion that Poff\'s and Barrett\'s convictions were unsafe. These factors included: a ‘packed jury,\' evidential deficiencies (including conflicting witness testimony), no motive, and that other lines of enquiry appear to have been neglected during the investigation and trial. In addition, the report found that there was no direct evidence against Poff and Barrett, with the case resting on the circumstantial and contradictory evidence of one witness. Dr Howlin concluded her report by stating: ""A twenty-first century criminal court would not convict Poff and Barrett on the basis of the evidence which was presented by the Crown in 1882. The convictions were also inconsistent with the legal standards of the period. “They were convicted on the basis of evidence which was both circumstantial and weak. The trials and conviction of Poff and Barrett included legal and procedural deficiencies which were ‘so inconsistent with the legal standards of the period and so objectively unsatisfactory and unfair, that they render the conviction unsafe.” This is the fourth occasion that a posthumous Presidential Pardon could be awarded. The first posthumous Presidential Pardon was awarded by President Higgins to Harry Gleeson in 2015. The second posthumous Presidential Pardon, and the first to be granted for events which occurred prior to the formation of the State, was granted to Myles Joyce in April 2018, who was executed having been found guilty of involvement in the Maamtrasna murders in 1882. The third posthumous pardon was awarded to John Twiss in 2021. The threshold to recommend a Presidential Pardon is high and, since 1937, only seven Presidential Pardons have been awarded.', 'Thousands receive Irish citizenship as part of ""wonderful celebration"" in Killarney More than 100 people from the US were among the thousands who received Irish citizenship during ceremonies in Killarney this week. 4,800 people were granted Irish citizenship in six ceremonies which took place on Monday, June 10 and Tuesday, June 11 at the INEC Killarney in Co Kerry.

"More than 2,300 allegations of historical sexual abuse in Irish schools, inquiry hears A new report has recommended a State inquiry into allegations of historical sexual abuse at more than 300 schools across Ireland. A Commission of Investigation is to be established following a recommendation in the Report of the Scoping Inquiry, which was published on Tuesday, September 3. The Scoping Inquiry, which set up to examine historical sexual abuse in Ireland's day and boarding schools run by religious orders, has been told of some 2,395 allegations of historical sexual abuse involving 884 alleged abusers in 308 schools across all parts of the country between the years 1927 to 2013, Ireland's Department of Education said on Tuesday. Most of these allegations have been reported from the records of some 42 religious orders that currently or previously ran schools in Ireland, the Department noted. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The Scoping Inquiry organized a Survivor Engagement process where those who had experienced sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders were invited to come forward and share their views regarding an appropriate State response. Participants reported experiences of sexual abuse in primary, post-primary, and special schools, both public and private, run by religious orders across Ireland. The report of the Scoping Inquiry contains detailed accounts of sexual abuse, rape, and sexual assault. It is ""deeply distressing to read,"" the Department of Education said on Tuesday. The establishment of a State inquiry into historical sexual abuse is one of a number of recommendations made by Senior Counsel Mary O’Toole in her report to Ireland's Minister for Education Norma Foley. The Scoping Inquiry report recommends that consideration be given by Government to establishing a redress scheme for survivors of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders. Further recommendations relate to improving the experience for survivors in legal processes and the establishment of dedicated support services for survivors, particularly in relation to the Commission and potential participation in that process. The Scoping Inquiry commissioned independent expert reports on child protection in Ireland's schools and restorative justice as part of its work. Minister Foley said on Tuesday: “The Report of the Scoping Inquiry is a harrowing document, containing some of the most appalling accounts of sexual abuse. ""The scale and horror of what people described in their interviews with the Scoping Inquiry is shocking, and the lasting impact on the lives of those survivors cannot be overstated. ""I have been deeply moved by the courage, fortitude, and openness of all those who have shared their experiences. “I am thinking of all those who came forward today as part of the Scoping Inquiry process and indeed those who are not in a position to do so at this point in their lives. I wish to remember and acknowledge in particular the late Mark Ryan, who, with his brother David, was instrumental in the establishment of the Scoping Inquiry. He is very much in our hearts today, and I am mindful that the first anniversary of his passing is approaching in the coming weeks. “I am announcing today that the government has accepted the principal recommendation of the Report of the Scoping Inquiry, which is for the establishment of a Commission of Investigation. Historical sexual abuse is a profoundly serious matter and needs to be examined in detail. “One of the most compelling aspects of the Report is that older participants provided devastating accounts of how sexual abuse in childhood has affected their entire lives, from their schooldays through adolescence, early adulthood and right through to later years. “I am pleased to note that the report states that current child protection measures in schools are robust and effective and I am conscious that the safety of children today is a matter of paramount concern to survivors and all of society.”",1,1_garda_man_video_dublin,"['garda', 'man', 'video', 'dublin', 'drew', 'abuse', 'sexual', 'inquiry', 'mcgreevy', 'threat']","['""I didn’t mean it to go so viral"" - Dublin man charged with threatening to kill Mary Lou McDonald Dublin man Richard McGreevy is accused of making threats to kill or cause serious harm to TD Mary Lou McDonald. Richard McGreevy, 28, has been charged in connection with an online video that contained threats to kill Sinn Féin President TD Mary Lou McDonald. McGreevy, with an address at Whitechurch Place, Rathfarnham, Co Dublin, appeared before the Dublin District Court this morning, July 19. An Garda Siochana announced on Thursday night that the man who was arrested at a residence in South Dublin earlier that day as part of an investigation into threats made online against a public representative and a Senior Garda Officer had been charged. McGreevy was charged under Section 5 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997; he is accused of making threats to kill or cause serious harm to McDonald.

In court on Friday, Detective Sergeant Gareth Kane gave evidence of McGreevy\'s arrest, charge, and caution, and said that McGreevy made no reply to the charge of threatening to kill or seriously harm McDonald. The Irish Examiner reports that in court, Detective Sergeant Kane claimed that McGreevy “broadcast on TikTok that he was going to kill a TD, and he incited violence against the commissioner of the garda [Drew Harris] and other gardaí."" At that point, McGreevy spoke up and addressed the judge: ""I was angry that day, I was so angry that day, I’ve already explained this. ""I put that up; I didn’t mean it to go so viral."" The court heard on Friday that McGreevy had a ""difficult"" and ""chaotic"" childhood, and defence solicitor Kevin Tunney suggested that McGreevy is a ""loner."" McGreevy is not a member of any organization or gang, the court heard. McGreevy faces up to ten years in prison if he is convicted of the charge. Legal aid was granted to McGreevy, who was not granted bail and was remanded in custody pending directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions. He will have his next hearing on July 26 at Cloverhill District Court. The charge comes on the foot of a complaint lodged by McDonald on Wednesday after the video allegedly filmed by McGreevy circulated online.

TD Mary Lou McDonald, the President of Sinn Féin and leader of Ireland’s opposition party, has spoken out about a death threat that was made against her online yesterday, July 16. “Last night a threat to kill me was issued online. The individual said he would shoot me dead,” McDonald said on social media on Wednesday. “This represents an escalation of targeted online abuse directed at me over the last year. It is totally unacceptable. “I have reported this to An Garda Síochána. “Ironically, this threat was made while I was hosting a discussion on the need for zero tolerance when it comes to violence against women and girls.” Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, McDonald further said the campaign against her has been “vicious, it has been sexist, misogynistic, it has been racist, and it’s also politically contrived to cause a problem between me and the working class communities that we represent.” McDonald said she is “satisfied” that Gardai are going to handle the threat. “But this cannot stand. It cannot stand that on any social media platform or anywhere else that somebody can brazenly come forward and threaten to take your life and somehow imagine that that is acceptable or okay or part of a political conversation. It’s not.” She added: “I’m no shrinking violet. I’m not a bit precious about people making all manner of commentary, but I’m drawing the line. I’ve had enough of it, quite frankly.” While she admitted she is “upset” about the threat, McDonald said: “It’s clearly not going to put me off doing my job and carrying out my democratic function and representing people to the best of my ability.” This death threat is an escalation in a vicious, sexist, misogynistic, racist campaign against me that has been ongoing for over a year and that has been politically contrived to cause problems between me and the working class communities we in Sinn Féin represent.

The video has since been shared by various other accounts on different platforms. Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast on Thursday morning, the day after she publicly condemned the video, McDonald said the threat against her “speaks to something much wider in our society, and is frightening.” The Sinn Féin leader said that in her role, she understands that she is susceptible to commentary and criticism, but that “every line has been now crossed” with this week\'s online threat. “This is just the latest escalation in something that I think is really dangerous, generally, and that I know has been very deliberately targeted at me, and I’m sick of it. “I hadn’t said much publicly throughout this year about what was going on, but once there is a direct threat made - openly, brazenly broadcast on social media - that a person will shoot you, that they will take your life, and that they feel comfortable saying that, broadcasting it, and announcing it to the world, clearly that puts you in the way of greater danger, and I found that frightening.” McDonald said she chose to speak out after the threat in terms of her “own personal security"" and also because “it is not on.” “It’s me this time,"" McDonald said. ""It could be anybody else. ""It is not acceptable in our society that people feel at liberty to throw their weight around like that and threaten to kill democratically elected politicians - or, by the way, anybody else.” McDonald, who noted that the matter was being investigated by Gardaí, said that “there have to be consequences for these kind of actions,” adding that “it’s not because I’m some sort of special category of person. I’m an equal citizen in this society and my safety is on an equal par with everybody else\'s.” Regarding the person who made the online threat, McDonald said: “The person who issued this threat against me spoke also about the issues around immigration and protest. He is part of that small section of Irish society that has chosen to be toxic and violent and disorderly and hateful, and they have to be faced down. “And, at the same time, the wider section of many communities who are not racist and hateful and all of those things but who are concerned and have not been engaged properly, who don’t have confidence in the way in which immigration, in particular, is being managed at this time - we need to engage that section of the population and talk and listen, and listen and talk, and lead.” McDonald went on to say that the TikTok video with the threat against her and Harris should not have been permitted to remain live for so long. After the arrest, RTÉ News reported on Thursday the video which was originally posted on TikTok has now been taken down from that platform but remains in circulation on Facebook and X. TikTok said on Thursday afternoon that the video violated its community guidelines which prohibit violent threats and incitement. It also said the content had been removed from its platform and the account banned. Meta also claimed the video had been removed from Facebook, but RTÉ reported that they were still able to access it through the site and it is also widely available on other social media platforms. IrishCentral was also easily able to find the video on X and Facebook on Thursday afternoon, though it had been shared by accounts slamming the man and his threats. RTÉ News added that neither TikTok nor Meta would say how long the video was on their platforms, why it was not taken down immediately, if they were cooperating with the garda investigation, or whether their content moderation and security procedures have proven to be extremely weak in this case. Both social media companies claim they do not allow violent threats, incitement to violence, or promotion of criminal activities but gardaí say criminal gangs use these social media platforms for organised crime activity.']",garda - man - video - dublin - drew - abuse - sexual - inquiry - mcgreevy - threat,1.0,False
