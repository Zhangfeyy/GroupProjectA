"Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,True
"Ceann Comhairle interview: ‘What is happening in this country of ours?’ Seán Ó Fearghaíl has not decided whether he will return to the next Dáil or ‘go home to count his cattle’ For Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl, the low point of 2023 came when the Dáil returned from its summer recess on September 20th. On that day a crowd of about 200 people gathered outside Leinster House protesting about everything from immigration to Covid-19 vaccines. There was a mock gallows featuring images of politicians from across the spectrum and a figure in a suit was hung in effigy. Protesters also jostled TDs attempting to enter Leinster House, with two needing Garda assistance and an escort away from the area. There were 13 arrests on the day. Ó Fearghaíl called it “an unprecedented event”, saying Oireachtas staff, political staff and “the pretty hard-nosed politicians themselves were the subject of attack and intimidation of a sort that we’ve never ever seen here before and never want to see again . . . “It left me wondering what was happening in this country of ours? “It left me wondering had we dealt adequately with the indications of all this that had manifested itself previously” like intimidation of library staff and the “blockading” of centres for asylum seekers. Asked about commentary suggesting gardaí had taken too soft an approach to such incidents previously, Ó Fearghaíl said he has “the height of regard for the gardaí” and “they adopted a strategy that they thought best at the time”. He also said: “Certainly protests are something we always have to see as part of the democratic process. “But when that degenerates into rioting, that’s a different story entirely” – a reference to the riot in Dublin in November. On the security measures like barriers and street closures that have been seen on several days outside Leinster House in recent months, Ó Fearghaíl said: “There’s probably at this stage the surplus of caution because of what happened on the 20th of September.” He also says of that day that, “I don’t think anybody anticipated the event was going to be what it turned out to be.” Now, Ó Fearghaíl says: “We’re trying to feel our way in terms of the new situation that we find ourselves in.” He says he feels a “deep sense of responsibility” to the civil servants, political staff and members of the Dáil and Seanad. He added: “The Constitution guarantees the members the right to come and go from the Houses of the Oireachtas without interference. “So we have to ensure in conjunction with the gardaí that there will not be interference in the necessary movement of people in and out of these Houses.” Ó Fearghaíl is adamant, however, that the high points of 2023 outnumber the lows. He cites the visit of US president Joe Biden, who addressed the Houses of the Oireachtas in April; the first full year of reopening since the Covid-19 pandemic; and his hosting of the speakers of parliaments from many different countries at the Council of Europe’s Presidents of Parliament conference in Dublin. He believes the unveiling at Leinster House of busts of both John Hume and David Trimble, the two key architects of the Belfast Agreement, are events that “will in time be shown to be of great significance”. He said both men had taken risks for peace. In reference to attempts to restore power-sharing in the North, he said: “In honouring them . . . we’re also, I suppose, indirectly saying to the people currently in charge, look, would you men and women take risks now and get the show back on the road so that the people in Northern Ireland can feel that they have the representation that they voted for.” He is happy with the work carried out in the Dáil in 2023, saying 41 Bills were passed. He praised Government Chief Whip Hildegarde Naughton for her role in ensuring there’s no  backlog of legislation ahead of the summer and Christmas breaks. Previously, in 2021, President Michael D Higgins wrote to the Oireachtas about the “overwhelming number of Bills” being sent to him in the final two weeks before Dáil recesses, saying it was “less than ideal” as he sought to scrutinise complex legislation. Ó Fearghaíl said the President should be pleased at the “smooth flow of legislation” in 2023. The Kildare South Fianna Fáil TD, who is 63, will not seek a third term as Ceann Comhairle should he return to the Dáil after the next general election. He hopes a woman or younger person gets the job. Will be back in the Dáil as a TD after the next election? “If I’m still in this job, when the election is called, God bless the Irish Constitution it provides for my [automatic] return if I wish.” However, he says his health, which he describes as “indifferent” in recent years, will be a factor in whether or not he decides to come back to the Dáil. He will discuss it with his family and the “tremendous supporters” he has had in Kildare since he first ran for election to the local authority in 1985. He said he will decide closer to the election “whether I want to go home and count my cattle and grow my chrysanthemums or whether I want to continue a job of public representation”.",-1,-1_northern_uk_dup_stormont,"['northern', 'uk', 'dup', 'stormont', 'posters', 'north', 'return', 'election', 'new', 'dáil']","['Irish unity in ‘touching distance’ after DUP vote, says McDonald Recall of the Assembly to elect Speaker could take place as early as Saturday Irish unity is within “touching distance” as a nationalist First Minister at Stormont is poised to come into office for the first time, according to Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Reacting to the DUP’s endorsement of a deal with the UK government that will end its two-year boycott of the powersharing Executive, Ms McDonald said the elevation of party vice-president Michelle O’Neill to the head of the North’s devolved government will be a moment of “very great significance”. The recall of the Assembly to elect a Speaker could take place as early as Saturday and DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson signalled on Tuesday his optimism that there are enough concessions to show that the “naysayers are wrong”. The deal is due to be published on Wednesday and Ms O’Neill said the next number of days are crucial to get the powersharing institutions up and running. Addressing media at Stormont, Ms McDonald alluded to previous political arrangements in Northern Ireland, saying: “I think a Sinn Féin First Minister, and Michelle coming into office as First Minister, for all really is the most striking evidence that that era is now gone; it is now consigned to the pages of the history books. “And more importantly it signals now the new Ireland emerging and the conversation around a new constitutional dispensation, ending partition, Irish unity, all of the opportunity that presents is in many ways embodied in this moment of Michelle O’Neill becoming First Minister here.” Ms McDonald added “I think that the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. And I think that’s a very exciting thing.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 when its former first minister Paul Givan quit the executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Donaldson admitted on Tuesday that they had not secured “everything” they had sought from London in relation to changes to the Windsor Framework deal struck between UK and EU last year. However, he said he had achieved a “good outcome for Northern Ireland” and pledged “zero” checks on goods and paperwork works destined for the North - through the “green lane” element of the Windsor Framework – from Britain. “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told reporters outside Stormont. Asked about a timeline for Stormont’s return, he said it was conditional upon the UK government “delivering on their side” but that he hoped it will happen quickly. DUP party discipline remained tight on Tuesday after Monday evening’s DUP executive meeting led to an internal party inquiry when details of Mr Donaldson’s briefing to 130 members were leaked by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Bryson live tweeted details in what he claimed was a “blow by blow account” of the five-hour meeting. Despite Mr Donaldson’s claims on Tuesday that there will be legal changes to the post-Brexit deal, Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris played down the prospect of fresh negotiations with the EU and said that “all conditions are now in place” for a return of the Executive. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was adamant that the Windsor Framework deal will not be changed “one sentence” and that the so-called Irish Sea Border will “still be there”. Mr Beattie expressed concern that the situation could “unravel” in coming days if the Assembly is not restored by Monday. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long told reporters it was a “bittersweet” day in that there was nothing in the DUP deal with the UK that “wasn’t available in 2018 under Theresa May”.', 'UK government publishes deal which will set stage for Stormont return Safeguarding the Union document was released online by the UK government on Wednesday  The text of the legislation which secured the DUP’s return to power-sharing in the North has been published. The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was released online by the UK government on Wednesday afternoon. The measures outlined in the document by the UK government include, as previously signalled, legislation “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the Union” and which amends the UK Internal Market Act 2020 to “guarantee Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the UK’s internal market.” It will also end dynamic alignment with EU law. Legislative change will “recognise the end of the automatic pipeline of EU law”; Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will be amended, “reflecting the new reality that the law which applies in Northern Ireland is now properly subject to the democratic oversight of the Northern Ireland Assembly through the Stormont Brake and the democratic consent mechanism.” The so-called Green Lane will be replaced with a UK internal market system, and the UK government “will commit that more than 80 per cent of all freight movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland take place under the UK internal market system, with independent scrutiny.” This will ensure “there will be no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks.” There will be a legal requirement that new legislation will be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, if so, for ministers to make a statement considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.” The document includes more than 20 provisions, which includes the creation of an Independent Monitoring Panel to “provide oversight of the implementation of new arrangements”, the creation of a UK East-West Council and the publication of operational arrangements for the Stormont Brake. The UK government will also “pursue an agreement with the EU on a long-term basis” to ensure the continued supply of necessary veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland beyond 2025. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said  before it was published that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. His party has been using a veto power to block Stormont’s devolved institutions for almost two years in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, Mr Donaldson announced earlier this week that his party was prepared to return to Stormont, dependent on the UK government implementing the various legislative assurances and other measures it has offered. This is expected to lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland within days and will see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill become the North’s first ever nationalist first minister. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return,” he said on Tuesday. The return of Stormont will also see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland. The financial package includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Mr Donaldson said the deal would represent a “significant change” in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit’s so-called Irish Sea border. He said: “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. “On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.” Sinn Féin has focused on the imminent return of the Stormont Assembly, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald stating that Irish unity is now within “touching distance” as she hailed the significance of her party assuming the role of Stormont first minister for the first time. Ms McDonald said the expected appointment of Ms O’Neill in the coming days would be a moment of “very great significance”. Mr Donaldson announced his support for a Stormont return after receiving the “decisive” backing of the 130-strong party executive during a five-hour meeting on Monday night. He said DUP party officers, a key 12-strong decision-making body, had also “mandated” him to move forward on the basis he was proposing. Support for the deal is not unanimous within the DUP and several senior figures remain opposed to the proposed agreement. - PA', 'Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024. In years to come, much will be made of the significance of this day. It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,False
"Catherine Martin plans to designate 14 new sporting events ‘free to air’, including Six Nations rugby Minister for Arts, Sports and Media also wants to make All Ireland football and hurling quarter and semi-finals free to air The Government is seeking to add 14 new events in GAA, soccer and rugby to the designated “free to air” list of sporting events that must be shown on television. Minister for Arts, Sports and Media Catherine Martin has published the list of the new events she wants to add to the free to air designation, which will now go out for public consultation. They include nine women’s events to be considered for a designation to achieve equivalence for women’s sports, as well as live coverage of Ireland’s men’s Six Nations rugby games, currently only designated for “deferred” coverage on free to air. The last review took place in 2017, adding the All Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final and the All Ireland Senior Camogie Final. The full list of events which will now go for public consultation is: · The quarter and semi-finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football and Senior Hurling Championships · The finals of the Senior Football and Hurling Provincial Championships · The quarter and semi-finals of the All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship · The finals of the Provincial Camogie Championship · The quarter and semi-finals of the All-Ireland Senior Ladies’ Football Championship · The finals of the Senior Ladies’ Provincial Football Championship · Ireland’s games in the Uefa Nations League (men’s) · Ireland’s games in the Uefa Women’s Nations League · Ireland’s home and away qualifying games in, and the opening games, Ireland’s games, and the semi-finals and final of, the Fifa Women’s World Cup Tournament · Ireland’s home and away qualifying games in, the opening games, Ireland’s games, the semi-finals and final of the Uefa European Women’s Football Championship · Ireland’s games in the Men’s Six Nations Rugby Championship (change from current “deferred” broadcast designation to “live” broadcast) · Ireland’s games in the Women’s Six Nations Rugby Football Championship · Ireland’s games in the Women’s Rugby World Cup Finals Tournament · The final of the European Rugby Champions Cup – should an Irish provincial team be represented In a statement, the Department of Arts, Sports and Media said the aim of designating events as free to air is “to try and balance the rights of the sporting bodies to exploit commercial opportunities afforded by their broadcasting rights and the needs of society to engage, as a whole, with culturally significant events”. The review is provided for in the Broadcasting Act 2009. In a statement Ms Martin said the review “provides an opportunity to ensure that our most memorable sporting moments are retained on national TV for the people of Ireland to view together on an equal basis”. “I hope to take this opportunity to deliver on a Programme for Government commitment to increase the visibility of women’s sport. The achievements of our female sporting talent should be available to view on our national broadcasters, providing both entertainment and valuable role models to our younger participants in sport. I encourage all interested parties and stakeholders to contribute to this consultation process,” she said.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.6523733899094342,False
"Irish politicians ‘speaking out of both sides of their mouths on nitrates derogation’, says Holly Cairns Social Democrats leader says politicians are afraid of losing votes over climate issues Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns has said a lot of politicians are not honest with the public about climate issues because they are afraid of losing votes. Ms Cairns criticised Opposition parties for not having a clear position on the nitrates derogation for Ireland and took aim at the Government for not preparing for the exemption being removed entirely. The Cork South-West TD, who grew up on a small farm, also said she finds the approach to communicating with farmers “ridiculous and a little bit insulting”. Asked why she thinks political parties might not be clear about the scale of change needed in terms of climate issues, Ms Cairns told the PA news agency: “I think [they’re] scared of losing the farming vote, and seeing everything in terms of election cycles.” “I grew up on a small farm in West Cork, a small dairy farm. Lots of my friends, my neighbours are farming, and the presumption that we somehow don’t understand the science, care about the future of the sector for future generations and all that stuff, I just find for one ridiculous, and for two a little bit insulting. “It’s this attitude that ‘Oh, to keep the farming vote, you kind of have to plamás them and tell them these things that aren’t reality’.” Ms Cairns used the example of Ireland getting an exemption to use more organic nitrates per hectare than other EU countries for what she said was political dishonesty on farming. Farmers in Ireland had an allowance of 250kg of nitrogen per hectare (N/ha), but this is reduced to 220kg N/ha from this month onwards, in an attempt to improve Ireland’s water quality. Most other countries’ limit is 170kg. “Like this whole debate with the nitrates derogation, since I got elected I’ve been saying to the Government, why are you continuing to extend the nitrates derogation when you’re walking farmers to a cliff edge and eventually it’s going to have to go? “We all know that, the farming community know that better than anyone. “Why aren’t you starting to put measures in place to support people in the change to make it fair and reasonable? Instead, no, deny that it has to happen, deny that it’s going to happen, try and fudge the science around emissions and then boom, there we are. The derogation is introduced, farmers are at a cliff edge. “I just think that doesn’t do anyone any favours.” Ms Cairns said that decisions need to be made on climate issues. “So we don’t see it as a ‘will we, won’t we?’, we see it as a must and how do we do it the right way, and I think it’s just unbelievable that isn’t the approach of every government at this point. “Around the time (of the nitrates debate), there was no clear position from any of the other opposition parties on the derogation except ‘Oh, we think we should keep it but we also think that we should protect water quality’. “That’s not a realistic position, that’s just speaking out of both sides of your mouth.” - PA",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time?

Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances?

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Widower’s pension ruling not expected to affect referendums Proposed referendum seeks to expand the constitutional definition of family beyond that based on marriage The Government will quickly introduce legislation to extend widows and widowers’ pensions to surviving partners in non-marital families, after Monday’s Supreme Court judgment found the relevant social welfare legislation was unconstitutional. But it is understood that Ministers and senior officials have been told that the judgment has no implications for the proposed referendum which seeks to expand the constitutional definition of family beyond the family based on marriage. Tipperary man John O’Meara was denied payment of a widower’s pension because he was neither married to nor in a civil partnership with Michelle Batey, his partner of almost 20 years and the mother of his children. Ms Batey died in 2021 after contracting Covid-19 while she was recovering from breast cancer. Mr O’Meara challenged the constitutionality of the social welfare legislation. The seven-judge Supreme Court on Monday quashed the refusal of the benefit and ruled the relevant provision of the social welfare legislation was invalid under the Constitution. The referendum Bill is being debated by the Seanad, where it is expected to be voted through this week, paving the way for polling day to be fixed for March 8th. During the debate the former minister for justice Michael McDowell questioned the need to hold the referendum in light of the judgment. Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman defended the Government proposals as it seeks to get the necessary legislation for the referendum over the line in the Oireachtas this week. It is understood Ministers and senior officials believe the judgment bolsters the arguments for the referendum. They say that because the case was decided on equality grounds, not on the basis that the O’Mearas were a “family” under article 41 of the Constitution, it strengthens the case for changing article 41. In his judgment, Chief Justice Donal O’Donnell, said: “For my part, I do not find the exclusive concept of family in article 41 that was contained in the 1937 Constitution either attractive or admirable or one that is well suited to a contemporary society... But if it is what the people chose in 1937, and how the document has been repeatedly understood, then in my view it is for the people to choose in what way that provision should be altered.” Mr Justice O’Donnell went on to explicitly reject the argument that the O’Mearas are a family as understood under article 41, saying that to do so would be a step too far in extending the meaning of the Constitution, while acknowledging that the wording may well be changed in the referendum. In a statement, the Government said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys and Attorney General Rossa Fanning were examining the judgment, including what legislation would be required to comply with it. This will be done “with all expediency”, the statement said.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits?

"Ireland should support return home for Ukrainians, says O’Gorman Minister expects between 13,000 and 15,000 asylum seekers to arrive in the country annually from now on  Ireland should support Ukrainians to return to their war-torn country by rebuilding infrastructure and possibly paying for travel back there, Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman has said. With the Temporary Protection Directive, which allows Ukrainians to live and work in the European Union, due to expire in March 2025, the Green Party TD said there is a “fundamental question” for Ireland and other EU member states that must be addressed urgently. He told The Irish Times Inside Politics Podcast that while the directive might be extended with new legislation, the EU needed to decide its position on the millions of Ukrainians who will be living in member states once the current rules expire. “I think that decision needs to be taken early this year in order for certainty to be provided to everyone,” he said. He said his view was that “first of all, we need to support Ukrainians to return to their country”, citing a “brain drain” in the country and the loss of its women and young people who have fled the Russian invasion. “I think Ireland and other member states should be supporting people to return.” In the first instance, he said, Ireland and other member states should provide proper infrastructural support and a “major reconstruction programme” in Ukraine. He also said he was “absolutely open to making it as easy as possible for people to return”, including assisted or incentivised methods such as paying for their return journeys. He said Ukrainians would however be more concerned about the prospects of rebuilding a life there rather than “the cost of a Ryanair ticket”. “I think everyone going back will accept it’s going to be tough now. But is there a future, is the EU going to come in in support of the rebuild the same way they supported the exodus?” he asked. Mr O’Gorman said he also expects between 13,000 and 15,000 asylum seekers to arrive in the country annually from now on, and that the system for accommodating them and processing their applications is not “fit for purpose”. He said Ireland is now receiving the EU average level of applications from people seeking international protection, but that it is “too much for the current system to face”. He said more staff would be allocated to the International Protection Office by Minister for Justice Helen McEntee to speed up processing and appeal times and the Government intended to move to accommodation more focused on State-run facilities, with a plan on this due to be brought to Cabinet shortly. However, he said that it would take a “number of years” to get enough accommodation on stream that would allow for a “steady state” in the new system and in the interim there will be a “ongoing reliance on private sector accommodation”. He said the Government had engaged with communities and that many centres had been opened without opposition, but that the system was under such pressure that it had to move quickly. When the decision was to place people in Roscrea’s Racket Hall hotel at short notice, there was a real risk of women and children being turned away without a bed, he said. Mr O’Gorman also confirmed that, while support and advice would be offered, the Government would withdraw accommodation after 90 days to Ukrainians arriving here. “Ultimately, the accommodation offering is for 90 days and people will be asked to leave the accommodation after that time,” he said, adding this had to be the case for it to be a “workable system”. He said the overall figures of Ukrainians coming here had sharply declined in recent months from a level of 600-700 per week to about 150 per week in January.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.

Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.9415272846623852,False
"Government TDs raise concerns over plans to cut supports for newly arriving Ukrainian refugees Fears expressed at Social Protection committee that mothers and children will end up homeless Government TDs have raised concerns over plans to cut accommodation and social protection supports for newly arriving Ukrainian refugees, expressing fears mothers and children will end up homeless and reduced welfare payments of €38.80 are too small. Sinn Féin meanwhile argued that the Government’s plans are “flimsy” as the Oireachtas committee on social protection considered the changes to legislation required to reduce payments from €232 to €38.80 per week. Despite the concerns, the amendments to the law passed committee stage and the legislative process will continue with the Government hoping to bring about the changes to the regime for Ukrainian refugees by early February. The Coalition plans to cut welfare rates for newly arriving Ukrainians who will live in designated accommodation centres – the locations of which are yet to be announced. Ukrainian refugees that source their own accommodation will still be entitled to the higher rates. In addition a separate measure being implemented by the Department of Integration will see a 90-day limit placed on State-accommodation for new arrivals. The reduced supports for new Ukrainian refugees were decided upon amid the huge pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees and asylum seekers. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys was quizzed on the measures during the committee meeting on Wednesday. She said the move to cut welfare rates is to bring Ireland in line with what other European Union countries are offering. Her party colleague, Fine Gael TD Fergus O’Dowd raised concern about the 90-day limit suggesting it will “create huge problems” and the people it affects could be put in “despairing situations”. Ms Humphreys said that people will have to vacate the accommodation after 90 days but before this they will be supported in finding employment and accommodation. Mr O’Dowd said it is “phenomenal” that the State has been able to provide accommodation for so many people – a figure of 76,000 was mentioned earlier in the meeting. However, he added: “That doesn’t get away from the fact you will find mothers with young children who will not have accommodation and who may very well be homeless.” Separately Fianna Fáil TD Éamon Ó Cuív said the €38.80 payment is “unrealistically small” both for people from Ukraine and asylum seekers from elsewhere that currently get the same sum. Ms Humphreys said the new designated accommodation centres will provide refugees with full board and laundry services “so there’ll be a lot of provision made for them”. She said the €38.80 is the amount that was decided upon adding: “I don’t think there’s any plans to increase that but obviously like everything else these things are always kept under review.” She said she would raise the concerns of Mr O’Dowd and Mr Ó Cuív at a Cabinet subcommittee meeting on refugee issues on Thursday. Sinn Féin TD Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire asked Ms Humphreys if she could offer any indication of where the new accommodation centres will be. She said the Department of Integration is “actively standing up arrival centres” and “locations will be confirmed as they become available”. Ms Humphreys said all new Ukrainian arrivals who need State provided accommodation will be housed in these centres under the terms of the legislation. Mr Ó Laoghaire expressed concern that the plans hinge on these designated centres adding: “I believe that that is flimsy.” He added: “I believe it assumes that everything will ... go plain sailing in finding new accommodation centres even though we have no indication of where these will be ... and what capacity they will have.” Ms Humphreys said the Department of Integration is satisfied they will be able to have the centres in place for the new arrivals. Mr Ó Laoghaire also raised concern over the 90-day accommodation limit suggesting people will be seeking accommodation in the “severely overheated” rental market after that time. Ms Humphreys said those in the State provided accommodation will have a choice of whether they want to find other housing or return to Ukraine and “People have to take responsibility for themselves as well in some respect.”",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.

"Ending aid to Unwra would be ‘catastrophic’, Tánaiste warns  Several donor countries have halted aid after allegations that a small number of Unwra staff were involved in the Hamas attacks on Israel  It would be “catastrophic” if more countries ceased funding the UN agency that works with Palestinian refugees in Gaza, and said that countries - including the US and UK - which have pulled funding “have acted far too prematurely”, Tanaiste Micheal Martin has warned/  Several donor countries have halted aid after allegations that a small number of United Nations Relief and Works Agency (Unwra) staff were involved in the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th that precipitated the current round of violence. The UN has appealed for aid to continue. “Ireland is a strong contributor and the bottom line is that without Unwra the humanitarian situation would become even more catastrophic in Gaza and in the West Bank,” Mr Martin told reporters in Cork on Sunday. “And don’t forget that Unwra also supports millions of refugees in Jordan and elsewhere so it’s hugely important agency, employing up to 30,000 people, 13,000 alone in Gaza. “That’s the context and people have to put this in perspective in terms of allegations against a number of workers on the ground and to pull out the entire programme, I think, it would be catastrophic in terms of the daily humanitarian needs of Gazans in particular in the midst of a most terrible conflict,” Mr Martin added. Mr Martin also said Ireland would “talk to other countries” about possibly supporting the South African case in the International Court of Justice which alleges genocide by Israel against the Palestinians. Earlier, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee said she would personally like Ireland to formally support South Africa’s case against Israel. Separately, the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland has said she would not advocate for representatives of the Government or the Opposition to turn down invitations to the White House on St Patrick’s Day. Dr Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, the head of the Mission of the State of Palestine, said she would “respect” whatever decision Irish politicians made about the annual US trip. “I wouldn’t say go or not to go ... I know how important this visit is,” she said. Sinn Féin has faced criticism from People Before Profit and pro-Palestine campaign groups over its plan to attend the St Patrick’s Day events in Washington, due to US support for Israel in the conflict. The Palestinian ambassador said she hoped Irish politicians attending engagements in the White House and Capitol Hill raised the war in Gaza “in a serious way” during any talks with the US administration. “Please keep the just cause of Palestinians in your hearts, your minds, in your talks,” she said. Ireland should try to use its close relationship with the US to push the case for a ceasefire in Gaza and self determination for Palestinians, she said. In a statement in recent days, Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O’Neill said the party would be travelling to the US on the annual trip “in the pursuit of peace”. She said Sinn Féin would “advocate for an end to the Israeli genocidal war and occupation in Gaza and the West Bank”, as well as call for a “peace process in Palestine” during the trip. The Irish Palestinian Solidarity Campaign has called on all politicians to turn down invitations to travel to the US to meet President Joe Biden on St Patrick’s Day. “This was our view long before Israel’s genocidal assault on the people of Gaza,” the campaign group said in a recent statement.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants.

Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.9217055116137437,False
"Double social welfare payment to be made to over 1 million people this week January cost-of-living welfare bonus was announced in budget last October A double social welfare payment announced as a January cost of living “bonus” in Budget 2024 is to be paid out to people this week. Some 1.3 million people will receive the double social welfare payment, which cost €342 million in the budget laid out last October. The bonus payment will be made to a wide range of social welfare recipients, including pensioners, jobseekers, lone parents, and those receiving disability allowance and carer’s allowance. People will be eligible for the once-off January bonus if they have been receiving social welfare payments for at least a year. The double lump sum payment will be paid on the same basis as the usual Christmas social welfare bonus. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said the bonus due to be paid to welfare recipients this week was aimed at helping families and other households to cope with cost of living increases. “This is about putting more money back into your pocket and recognising that families continue to feel the pinch, particularly after the Christmas period,” she said. “This will see a double lump sum weekly payment being made to support 1.3 million people – the likes of our pensioners, carers, people with disabilities, lone parents and low income families,” she said. Figures released by the Department of Social Protection detail that more 500,000 people on the State pension will receive the double payment, as well as 116,350 people on Jobseeker’s Allowance, 158,150 people on Disability Allowance, and 43,606 people availing of the One Parent Family payment, along with thousands of people in receipt of 27 other social welfare schemes and supports.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided.

"Algeria and Botswana to be added list of ‘safe’ countries for asylum applicants Two new countries to be added to list of safe countries of origin for international protection applicants Algeria and Botswana will be added to Ireland’s list of “safe countries” of origin. The move comes as immigration tops the list of issues getting the attention of voters in the past month, according to public sentiment tracking by Ipsos B&A. Safe countries are places where generally there is no persecution, torture, inhumane treatment or conflict. It is understood that Minister for Justice Helen McEntee examined conditions in a number of other countries and then decided to add the further two to the existing list. The designation is part of a memo due to be brought to Cabinet on Tuesday, which will see more asylum seekers go through a fast tracking process. The following countries are currently designated as safe countries of origin: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and South Africa. It comes after a new measure of public sentiment introduced by The Irish Times and Ipsos B&A on Monday revealed that immigration is topping the list of issues grabbing voters’ attention. Almost a quarter (24 per cent) of respondents to the survey cited immigration issues when asked what they had noticed about what the Government had done recently. This is in contrast to last July when immigration was mentioned by just 6 per cent of voters.

"Failed asylum applicants to be deported on dedicated flights chartered by State Move aims to ‘normalise’ deportations and is one of several immigration crackdowns announced by Government The Government is to start running regular charter flights dedicated to deporting people who have failed in their asylum applications. The first flights, which would use private aircraft hired by the Department of Justice, are expected to happen later this year. The move comes as the Government attempts to present a tougher image on immigration in advance of local and European elections in June. Immigration tops the list of issues getting the attention of voters in the past month, according to public sentiment tracking by Ipsos B&A. Other planned measures included adding Algeria and Botswana to the official list of “safe countries” which will allow faster processing of immigration claims. International protection (IP) applicants coming from those countries are to have their applications decided on within a maximum of 90 days. On Tuesday, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee outlined fresh plans to clamp down on those who already have refugee status in another European state. They are to be entered into an inadmissibility procedure, which will also be subject to fast processing. The measures are to come into effect from Wednesday. Together these measures would lead to the potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the IP system here, Ms McEntee said. Adding Botswana and Algeria to the “safe countries” list brings to 10 the number of countries in that category. There were 1,462 IP applicants from Algeria last year and 343 from Botswana. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. “It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way.” Ms McEntee said the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. Ms McEntee confirmed the State would charter planes to deport people whose applications have been turned down on appeal to particular countries. The Government has not run its own chartered deportation flights since at least 2018. It has instead relied on regularly scheduled commercial flights to accommodate those being deported. On rare occasions, it has also deported people on chartered flights run by other EU member states. According to procurement documents issued on Tuesday, the State intends to “normalise” its approach to deportations following a moratorium during the Covid-19 pandemic. It says it expects to deport “a sufficient number of individuals from specific countries of origin, to an extent that the use of charter flight operations would become economically viable”. The Coalition is now conducting a market “sounding” exercise to seek information from airline companies who can provide such a service. Some of these charter flights would make multiple stops in the EU to pick up other unsuccessful asylum applicants, as part of a joint arrangement with other countries, before travelling on to a final destination. According to the procurement documents, Ireland has “in the past, participated in joint return operations” with other member states, where it avails of seats on a charter service funded by another country. “These services are offered to the State on a reciprocal basis and there is an obligation on Ireland to provide a similar service to other Member States at appropriate junctures,” one document states. Statistics relating to failed asylum applicants suggest the most likely destinations for chartered flights would be Algeria, Georgia and Nigeria. Last year, about 750 deportation orders were signed but only about 80 were enforced. The Government says a large proportion of the remaining failed asylum applicants left the country of their own accord without informing authorities. Ireland last took part in a dedicated deportation flight in 2019 when it obtained seats on a flight chartered by Belgium and Iceland to return Georgian and Albanian nationals. In 2019, it obtained seats on a UK charter flight deporting failed asylum applicants to Nigeria.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,False

We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.7657279451466773,True
"Irish unity in ‘touching distance’ after DUP vote, says McDonald Recall of the Assembly to elect Speaker could take place as early as Saturday Irish unity is within “touching distance” as a nationalist First Minister at Stormont is poised to come into office for the first time, according to Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Reacting to the DUP’s endorsement of a deal with the UK government that will end its two-year boycott of the powersharing Executive, Ms McDonald said the elevation of party vice-president Michelle O’Neill to the head of the North’s devolved government will be a moment of “very great significance”. The recall of the Assembly to elect a Speaker could take place as early as Saturday and DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson signalled on Tuesday his optimism that there are enough concessions to show that the “naysayers are wrong”. The deal is due to be published on Wednesday and Ms O’Neill said the next number of days are crucial to get the powersharing institutions up and running. Addressing media at Stormont, Ms McDonald alluded to previous political arrangements in Northern Ireland, saying: “I think a Sinn Féin First Minister, and Michelle coming into office as First Minister, for all really is the most striking evidence that that era is now gone; it is now consigned to the pages of the history books. “And more importantly it signals now the new Ireland emerging and the conversation around a new constitutional dispensation, ending partition, Irish unity, all of the opportunity that presents is in many ways embodied in this moment of Michelle O’Neill becoming First Minister here.” Ms McDonald added “I think that the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. And I think that’s a very exciting thing.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 when its former first minister Paul Givan quit the executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Donaldson admitted on Tuesday that they had not secured “everything” they had sought from London in relation to changes to the Windsor Framework deal struck between UK and EU last year. However, he said he had achieved a “good outcome for Northern Ireland” and pledged “zero” checks on goods and paperwork works destined for the North - through the “green lane” element of the Windsor Framework – from Britain. “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told reporters outside Stormont. Asked about a timeline for Stormont’s return, he said it was conditional upon the UK government “delivering on their side” but that he hoped it will happen quickly. DUP party discipline remained tight on Tuesday after Monday evening’s DUP executive meeting led to an internal party inquiry when details of Mr Donaldson’s briefing to 130 members were leaked by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.

The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was released online by the UK government on Wednesday afternoon. The measures outlined in the document by the UK government include, as previously signalled, legislation “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the Union” and which amends the UK Internal Market Act 2020 to “guarantee Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the UK’s internal market.” It will also end dynamic alignment with EU law. Legislative change will “recognise the end of the automatic pipeline of EU law”; Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will be amended, “reflecting the new reality that the law which applies in Northern Ireland is now properly subject to the democratic oversight of the Northern Ireland Assembly through the Stormont Brake and the democratic consent mechanism.” The so-called Green Lane will be replaced with a UK internal market system, and the UK government “will commit that more than 80 per cent of all freight movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland take place under the UK internal market system, with independent scrutiny.” This will ensure “there will be no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks.” There will be a legal requirement that new legislation will be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, if so, for ministers to make a statement considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.” The document includes more than 20 provisions, which includes the creation of an Independent Monitoring Panel to “provide oversight of the implementation of new arrangements”, the creation of a UK East-West Council and the publication of operational arrangements for the Stormont Brake. The UK government will also “pursue an agreement with the EU on a long-term basis” to ensure the continued supply of necessary veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland beyond 2025. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said  before it was published that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. His party has been using a veto power to block Stormont’s devolved institutions for almost two years in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, Mr Donaldson announced earlier this week that his party was prepared to return to Stormont, dependent on the UK government implementing the various legislative assurances and other measures it has offered. This is expected to lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland within days and will see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill become the North’s first ever nationalist first minister. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return,” he said on Tuesday. The return of Stormont will also see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland. The financial package includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Mr Donaldson said the deal would represent a “significant change” in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit’s so-called Irish Sea border. He said: “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. “On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.” Sinn Féin has focused on the imminent return of the Stormont Assembly, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald stating that Irish unity is now within “touching distance” as she hailed the significance of her party assuming the role of Stormont first minister for the first time. Ms McDonald said the expected appointment of Ms O’Neill in the coming days would be a moment of “very great significance”. Mr Donaldson announced his support for a Stormont return after receiving the “decisive” backing of the 130-strong party executive during a five-hour meeting on Monday night. He said DUP party officers, a key 12-strong decision-making body, had also “mandated” him to move forward on the basis he was proposing. Support for the deal is not unanimous within the DUP and several senior figures remain opposed to the proposed agreement. - PA', 'Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024. In years to come, much will be made of the significance of this day. It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,True

It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,True
"Sudden resignation of Sinn Féin TD could hardly come at a worse time for a party already reeling Radio station KFM has said Patricia Ryan will give interview later this week to talk about ‘leadership issues’ and ‘censorship’ The sudden resignation of Kildare South TD Patricia Ryan from Sinn Féin could hardly have come at a worse time for the party, following a fortnight of recriminations over a child sex offences controversy involving a former employee. When a TD resigns from a party – especially one as disciplined as Sinn Féin – the obvious question is why? The first signs of trouble began to filter out on Wednesday afternoon when journalists in Kildare heard rumours that Ryan, who has kept quite a low profile during her time in the Dáil, was about to step down. The rumblings came despite any public indication from the politician that this was the case. Then, just after 9.30pm on Wednesday, in an email labelled “Resignation of Patricia Ryan”, Sinn Féin announced she had quit the party, but offered no official reason. It was notable that were no comments attributed to Ryan or party leader Mary Lou McDonald about the matter, which would normally be expected when a colleague steps down. Sinn Féin hinted at the reason for her departure, saying a contested selection convention was due to take place on Thursday and that Ryan had been invited to seek the nomination to run again in Kildare South. The party’s story appears to be that Ryan was unhappy and quit rather than looking for the nomination. End of story, nothing to see here. Except, not quite. According to two well-placed sources, Ryan has complained for months of feeling isolated and sidelined within the party. One local source said they believed she has been “in a lonely place for quite some time”. She has promised her local radio station, KFM, an exclusive interview on Friday. The station has said she will talk about “leadership issues” and “censorship”, an indication that some internal Sinn Féin difficulties could be about to become public, and not for the first time. The party has previously faced allegations of bullying. Clare TD Violet Anne Wynne, who also left the party after being elected to the Dáil in 2020, cited facing “psychological warfare” while she was on maternity leave. The issue is not something the party will want to have resurrected at a time of fevered expectations of a general election in the near future. Compounding Sinn Féin’s misery, the Dáil’s business committee met on Thursday and approved a proposal to hear statements on child protection next Tuesday, which will kick the controversy over party officials providing employment references for convicted child sex offender Michael McMonagle, a former Sinn Féin press officer, into another week. There are still outstanding questions there about who in the party was aware that two former senior officials provided those references when McMonagle sought to move on to the British Heart Foundation after leaving the party when it emerged he was under investigation for the offences. So what does it all mean for Sinn Féin? Instead of being out talking to journalists on the Leinster House plinth, putting forward their criticisms of the Government, Sinn Féin is on the defensive. For now, the storm clouds around McDonald’s party show no sign of abating.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Sinn Féin members told not to ask Mary Lou McDonald ‘negative’ or ‘inappropriate’ questions Eleven Monasterevin Kildangan Sinn Féin members quit as fallout over Patricia Ryan’s resignation deepens Sinn Féin grassroots members were told not to ask Mary Lou McDonald “negative” or “inappropriate” questions at a recent party event, sparking a major row over alleged “censorship” amid nearly a dozen resignations. Eleven members of the Monasterevin Kildangan Sinn Féin cumann have now quit as the fallout over the resignation of Kildare South TD Patricia Ryan on Thursday deepens. In an interview with KFM on Friday, Ms Ryan cited dissatisfaction over the handling of local tensions as one of the reasons she quit the party, alongside the fact questions to the leadership had been “vetted”. The Irish Times has learned that before an event to “rally the troops” in the Osprey Hotel in Naas earlier this week, the Kildare Sinn Féin county board, known as the comhairle ceantair, told grassroots members of local branches to submit their proposed questions into a WhatsApp group in advance. The chair of the comhairle ceantair said they did not want anyone to let the group down with “inappropriate negative-type questions”. Members of Ms Ryan’s local cumann in Monasterevin Kildangan took objection to the requests, asking what was meant by “inappropriate” and “negative” questions. They were told that it was for the purpose of ensuring the questions were “relevant”. The cumann members objected again and asked who ultimately would decide whether a question was appropriate. One member said there was “some concern” that the county board was “trying to suppress free speech by vetting or otherwise restricting what can be asked”. In response, another party member said: “This isn’t about free speech, this is about respect for our party president.” Nick Greaves, who has now resigned as chairman of the Monasterevin Kildangan cumann, confirmed that 11 people including Ms Ryan handed in their resignation notices. Asked about Ms Ryan’s comments on KFM that questions to the leadership were “vetted”, Mr Greaves said: “There was a meeting at the Osprey Hotel in Naas which Mary Lou McDonald was to attend, a ‘rally the troops’ exercise to raise morale among the activists. The comhairle ceantair asked who was going to go, but then they wanted to know what questions we would be asking so that no one would be asking inappropriate or embarrassing questions. We questioned that, because it came across as censorship.” Cumann secretary Aaron Sheppard, who has also resigned, said the request came across to him as an attempt to “silence” grassroots members. In response to queries, a Sinn Féin spokesman said: “We were aware there were issues in the constituency. There were no formal complaints made. The party attempted to resolve the issues arising through mediation and discussion. This was not successful. We don’t believe there was vetting of questions.” When the content of the messages was put to the party, a spokesman said that “if what is alleged did transpire, that was inappropriate”. Mr Sheppard said a “disconnect” had developed between the party and grassroots members in recent months and claimed a “nasty” environment had spread across the Sinn Féin structures in Kildare South. Supporters of Ms Ryan, who was elected to the Dáil in 2020, also believe she was being forced out by the party in favour of other candidates for the forthcoming general election. The TD has denied she quit when she heard that it would be a contested selection convention, saying she felt “pushed” out by the failure of Sinn Féin’s leadership to address local issues. Asked why he quit, Mr Greaves said: “The atmosphere had become so toxic. My feeling was that Patricia isn’t a perfect TD but she was a more than adequate TD and it makes strategic sense to put the incumbent forward again. She was doing the job, she got elected, it made sense.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Who is Niall Ó Donnghaile, the former Sinn Féin senator who resigned over ‘inappropriate’ texts to teenager? A former lord mayor of Belfast, he resigned his Seanad seat last year citing health reasons Niall Ó Donnghaile is a former Belfast-based Sinn Féin senator. He previously served as lord mayor of Belfast from 2011 to 2012 and was a councillor on Belfast City Council from 2011 to 2016. The Belfast native was also a former community worker. He was first elected to the Seanad in 2016 and was re-elected to the position again in 2020. Ó Donnghaile announced his surprise resignation from the Seanad in December last year, citing health reasons. It has since emerged that Ó Donnghaile was the party member who stood down after allegedly sending inappropriate text messages to a teenager. In his statement last December, he said he had been unable to attend the Seanad due to advice from his doctor. “It is unlikely that this situation will change in the short-term. Therefore I feel the best decision for myself, my family and the party going forward is to resign from the Seanad and step back from public life”. His resignation took effect immediately. Speaking at the time of his resignation, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she hoped Ó Donnghaile could overcome his health challenges and wished him well for the future. She said he spent almost eight years “giving voice to northern nationalists in the Oireachtas”. “Niall served diligently during that period, and indeed prior during his time as a member of Belfast City Council and as Ardmhéara Beál Feirste. In particular, Niall made a valuable contribution to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday agreement,” she said. On his profile on the social media platform X, Ó Donnghaile said he is currently “taking things a bit easier”.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments.

"Portrait of former mayor Niall Ó Donnghaile  removed from wall inside Belfast City Hall  Senator resigned from Sinn Féin   last year amid investigation into complaints of inappropriate texts to teenager A portrait of former Sinn Féin Belfast lord mayor Niall Ó Donnghaile has been removed from City Hall amid a controversy around text messages he sent to a teenager. Group leaders on the council agreed to the move on Thursday following Mr Ó Donnghaile’s admission he quit Sinn Féin last year after the party received complaints over him sending allegedly inappropriate texts to a teenage party member. Sinn Féin referred the matter to the PSNI and social services last September, but no criminal investigation was undertaken. Sinn Féin vice president Michelle O’Neill said the removal of the portrait was “appropriate” given what she described as Mr Ó Donnghaile’s “completely inappropriate” behaviour. Mr Ó Donnghaile became the youngest Lord Mayor of Belfast  at the age of 25 in 2011 and, like all who hold that office, had an official portrait painted and displayed to mark his year in the role. He went on to serve as a senator in Seanad Éireann before his resignation last December. Sinn Féin is facing questions over its handling of the case, which emerged after the separate case of the former party press officer, Michael McMonagle, who admitted child sex offences earlier this year. McMonagle (42), from Limewood Street, Derry, last month admitted to a series of offences, including attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity. Sinn Féin backed the call to remove Mr Ó Donnghaile’s portrait from City Hall. Asked about the proposed removal when speaking to reporters in Belfast on Thursday morning, Ms O’Neill said: “I think it is appropriate. His behaviour was completely inappropriate so, therefore, I think that we had no issue whatsoever in backing the removal of the portrait.” Asked whether she had any regrets over her party leader Mary Lou McDonald issuing a statement paying tribute to Mr Ó Donnghaile’s contribution when he left in December, Ms O’Neill said: “I think Mary-Lou McDonald tried to set that record straight in terms of the considerations that she had to take on board, particularly in relation to his severe mental health, and that was the only consideration that we had whenever he stepped back. “It’s appropriate that he stepped back but I’m very confident in terms of how we conducted ourselves, how we referred him to the PSNI and to social services, that that was correct and proper. “I think that was appropriate but we were concerned about his mental health and we also had the issue of legally being able to name him.” In a statement, Belfast City Council said: “After agreement at a meeting of the Party Group leaders today (Thursday 17 October), the portrait of former Lord Mayor Niall Ó Donnghaile has been removed from display at City Hall.” - PA",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Sinn Féin says its records show person at centre of Ó Donnghaile controversy was 17 when he received messages Fine Gael TD and former Labour Senator have publicly suggested, including on the floor of the Dáil, that the individual was 16 at the time Sinn Féin has maintained that its records show the young person at the centre of the Niall Ó Donnghaile controversy was 17 when he received inappropriate messages from its former Senator. Fine Gael TD Ciarán Cannon and former Labour Senator Maíríá Cahill have publicly said, including on the floor of the Dáil, that the individual was in fact 16 at the time. This would run contrary to what Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald informed the house of on Tuesday during statements on child protection, in which she also confirmed that Mr Ó Donnghaile had resigned after sending the messages. She said the matter “relates to an incident where a Sinn Féin representative sent inappropriate text messages to a 17-year-old”. Asked to confirm the person was 17 at the time communications were sent, a Sinn Féin spokesman said: “Our party records confirm he was 17 years of age at the time of the incident. It was because he was a minor that we referred the matter to the PSNI and Social Services.” Sinn Féin was asked if it was happy that its records were correct, and whether it would make any efforts to verify the accuracy of its records. A Sinn Féin spokesman said: “We stand over our records, the person involved submitted these details,” adding that the person had requested that their privacy be respected and no action taken that would reveal the identity of the person. The PSNI has said safeguarding assessments and engagement with other statutory bodies were conducted and no formal complaint was received. Ms McDonald told the Dáil there was no finding of illegality and no criminal charges were pursued, but that Mr Ó Donnghaile’s actions were not acceptable to Sinn Féin. This was communicated to him at a meeting on October 5th last year, and he said he would resign from both the Seanad and the party. Elsewhere. the party confirmed the teenager had discussed the issue with Ógra Shinn Féin, it youth wing, before last September. Mr Ó Donnghaile was suspended from the party last September over the matter, but did not resign from the Seanad until late December, at which point leader Ms McDonald praised his work but did not divulge what had transpired. In the Dáil this week Ms McDonald said that a “party councillor” received a complaint last September that an inappropriate message had been sent by Mr Ó Donnghaile to a 17-year-old male party member. Sources have told The Irish Times the young person revealed the existence of the texts in the months previous. A Sinn Féin spokesman said “the young person did discuss this issue with some of his peers in Ógra” and did so “in the weeks prior to 11th of September when he contacted the party and the matter was referred to the PSNI. “When the young person contacted Sinn Féin he was advised to retain all messages on his phone as they would be required by the PSNI. We then referred the matter to the PSNI and Social Services. The family confirmed to the party that the messages had been shown to the PSNI as part of their investigation.” There have also been questions around why Sinn Féin did not refer the matter to the Garda as Mr Ó Donnghaile spent three days a week in the Seanad. “The messages were sent to a young person in the North so it had to be reported to the PSNI and Social Services, who jointly investigated the matter,” the spokesman said. Separately, Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns has said Ms McDonald should retract a statement she made about Mr Ó Donnghaile, in which she praised his work when he stepped down in December last year.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked?

"Gerry Hutch considers general election run to unseat Mary Lou McDonald in Dublin Gangland figure was acquitted last year of organising Regency Hotel gun attack which accelerated Hutch-Kinahan feud Prominent gangland figure Gerry Hutch is considering running as an independent in the upcoming general election, in the hope of unseating Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald. Mr Hutch (61), who was acquitted last year of organising the  Regency Hotel gun attack which accelerated the  Hutch-Kinahan feud, is examining the possibility of running in Dublin Central, a four-seat constituency comprising the north inner city where he grew up. Rumours have spread over the last week that Mr Hutch was considering a Dáil run. On Sunday, a number of local sources confirmed he has been contemplating contesting the election for the last several weeks and is close to a decision. One source, who is close to the family, said one of Mr Hutch’s primary motivations is to take votes away from Sinn Féin, which is currently significantly down in the polls and dealing with several controversies. In the 2020, Ms McDonald topped the poll in Dublin Central with 35 per cent of first preference votes. Mr Hutch has harboured a deep animosity towards Sinn Féin since the Regency trial, when former party member and Dublin city councillor Jonathan Dowdall gave evidence that he masterminded the 2016 attack with the goal of killing rival criminal Daniel Kinahan. The Special Criminal Court rejected Dowdall’s evidence after he was caught out in several lies. It acquitted Mr Hutch of murder but said it was satisfied he had authority over the three AK-47 rifles used in the attack. Mr Hutch has 30 previous convictions and is believed to be behind some of the largest robberies in the history of the State. It is not clear if he believes he can win a seat or if he intends to run solely as a spoiler candidate. He has significant support in the north inner city, where he established Corinthians, a well-known boxing club in Summerhill which trained Olympic champion Kelly Harrington. However, it is not clear if he has any strong support in the rest of the constituency which includes Cabra, Drumcondra and Phibsborough. “He hasn’t a hope of getting enough votes outside of his home turf,” said a local political source. However, it remains “theoretically possible” he could take enough votes away from Ms McDonald to endanger her re-election chances, given the party’s current precarious position, the source said. “There’s certainly an element of revenge to it,” said another source close to the family. Members of the Hutch family did not respond to a request for comment when contacted on Sunday. Mr Hutch splits his time between his home in Clontarf, Dublin and the Spanish island of Lanzarote. He remains a frequent visitor to the north inner city where many of his family and friends still live. It is not known if Mr Hutch intends to run a traditional campaign involving posters and door-to-door canvassing. Any in-person campaigning will likely raise a number of security concerns. Mr Hutch has been the target of a several failed assassination attempts and has in the past been officially warned by gardaí of threats to his life. However, the threat to him as lessened significantly in recent years and he now moves about freely in Dublin with no visible protection. “He will receive the same treatment as anyone else,” said a Garda source. “If a threat is uncovered he will be advised of that and told to take appropriate measures.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.8743110724559462,False
"Portmarnock Golf Club may take swing at hosting Women’s Open Club elected its first women members in 2022, paving the way for the R&A to consider it as an Open host Just a few years after electing its first women members, Portmarnock Golf Club has now set its sights on hosting the Women’s Open. The Cabinet will hear tomorrow how bringing the Open Championship (often referred to as the British Open) and the Women’s Open (originally the Women’s British Open) to the north Co Dublin club could lead to an economic injection of almost €340 million. The estimate is contained in an analysis of the benefits of hosting the tournaments at Portmarnock — which elected its first women members in the club’s more than 120-year history in 2022 — that is to be submitted to the Government by Minster for Sport Catherine Martin. She secured Cabinet approval in July to explore potential bids to bring the Open Championships — which have never been held outside the UK — to Dublin. Since then, an economic impact assessment has been carried out and discussions with the organisers, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, have led to the prospect of Ireland hosting multiple Open tournaments. Portmarnock’s proximity to the city and the airport, and its capacity to host large crowds are among the reasons it is considered to be a leading candidate for the event. Hosting three Opens over several years as well as at least one Women’s Open would result in a cumulative gross economic impact of some €338 million, according to the analysis. It is estimated that 245,000 tickets would be sold each year the tournament is held in Portmarnock. When the proposals first emerged in July, Ms Martin said hosting the championships would “have a positive impact on closing the gender participation gap in sport” and “increase Ireland’s reputation as a world centre for golf”.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system.

"Sinn Féin employee resigns after incident that led to damage of DUP portrait in Belfast City Hall The party confirmed the move in a statement, saying it had notified the PSNI after event took place over weekend Sinn Féin has confirmed that a party employee has resigned following their involvement in an incident that led to a DUP portrait being damaged in Belfast City Hall. In a statement issued on Monday evening, the party said it had notified the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) about the incident, which took place on Saturday. It is understood a framed portrait of former DUP lord mayor Wallace Brown was damaged after it was taken off the wall at City Hall and had its glass smashed. A Sinn Féin spokesperson said the employee, who worked in the Assembly, was “immediately suspended” after informing the party chief whip about the matter. “We have notified the PSNI today. The employee has now resigned from their employment and their party membership,” the spokesperson added. Belfast City Council said it was assessing the extent of the damage and “looking into the circumstances”. “No further action has been taken at this time,” it said. The damage happened following an event at City Hall on Saturday evening to celebrate an Irish language group’s 20th anniversary. Glór na Móna said it had no knowledge of the incident and only became aware after being contacted by council staff on Monday as part of an investigation. The group said it was “extremely disappointed”. “This is completely contrary to the ethos and principles of our organisation and the spirit of our successful anniversary celebratory event.” The suspension of the Sinn Féin staff member comes just days after a portrait of former Sinn Féin Belfast lord mayor Niall Ó Donnghaile was removed from City Hall amid a controversy around text messages he sent to a teenage boy. Sinn Féin vice-president and Stormont First Minister Michelle O’Neill said the removal of the portrait was “appropriate” given what she described as Mr Ó Donnghaile’s “completely inappropriate” behaviour. On Sunday, the teenager said Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald owed him an apology for the party’s “disastrous” handling of Mr Ó Donnghaile’s resignation, the party’s leader in the Seanad at the time, last December. During Assembly questions on Monday, Ms O’Neill told the chamber she was “deeply sorry”. She was asked by DUP MLA Jonathan Buckley to clarify the boy’s age, after claims he was sent the messages when he was 16. Ms O’Neill replied: “According to our records the young person was in fact, 17. That’s the records we have in our files of membership.” She said that she was “sorry and angry” that the young person had to “endure any inappropriate or unacceptable behaviour” and that Mr Ó Donnghaile had faced consequences for his actions.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Social Democrats promise to spend €250m on early years education and cap fees at €250 a month ‘Twin-track’ system would use budget surpluses to buy existing childcare businesses and build new facilities The Social Democrats have promised to buy up small childcare operators as part of a plan to build a public system for early years education and bring down costs to parents to €250 a month. The party published its pre-election plan for Early Years Care & Education in Dublin on Wednesday. Jennifer Whitmore, the party’s spokeswoman on children, said that in government, the Social Democrats would invest €250 million in the existing system to bring down the cost of childcare to €250 per child per month, using the current structures for subsidising care. Promising a “twin track approach”, Ms Whitmore said that the party would start “developing the pathway to the public model”, with €100 million annually put aside from current budgetary surpluses to build new childcare facilities and purchase both vacant purpose-built settings and operational businesses. The party estimates that the cost of running 80 services, catering for approximately 6,000 children, would be about €50 million per year at current salary rates. Purchases of operational businesses would be made on a voluntary basis, Ms Whitmore said. The party is also promising to ensure no new schools are built without a childcare facility on the site. The party’s childcare document argues that smaller business are being bought out by “large multinationals or by capital management companies”, with significant amounts of taxpayer funds “taken for profit for investment funds, rather than being reinvested in the service”. Asked if the Social Democrats would remove private provision entirely, Ms Whitmore said there would likely be some degree of private provision under a fully operational version of their policies, but that larger corporate entities would not be supported. “The problems we see in care provision, in childcare and in care for older people is because we have actually focused far too much on the use of the corporates to provide fundamental public services,” she said “Absolutely we are not factoring them into this policy. What we want is a policy where the State runs childcare and early year services and they are run for the benefit of parents and for children and for the staff that’s in them.” The party’s document refers to the example of Canada, which it said has stricter conditions for providers in receipt of public funds, which must sign up to principles in keeping with public provision. “As a result, multinationals and investment funds are not interested in childcare in Canada as profit extraction is capped, there are clear rules about how much parents pay, and providers must open their books to show what they are paying staff,” the policy said. “If 60 or 70 per cent of a business’s turnover is coming from the taxpayer, government should have a right to talk to those businesses about profit caps and staff working conditions.”",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.7792062165616179,False
"Hate crime law among five Bills rushed through Dáil in six hours Defamation Bill and Mental Health Bill will not be completed before general election but nine pieces of legislation set to be passed The Government on Wednesday night rushed through a number of priority Bills in a scramble to clear the decks in advance of the dissolution of the Dáil and the general election. A number of key pieces of legislation completed their passage through the Dáil with the Government imposing a guillotine on debates. Five Bills were considered and passed in the Dáil in under six hours, a process that normally takes weeks. The most contentious was the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill which was amended because of a groundswell of opposition that turned into a backbench revolt, after it had been passed in the Dáil. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee amended the legislation in the Seanad to delete the references to incitement to violence or hatred. It also removes reference to the EU framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia and its title changes to the Criminal Justice (Hate Offences) Act. Other Bills were the Maternity Protection Bill, which will allow paid extended maternity leave for mothers undergoing cancer treatment; the Housing Bill; the Seanad Electoral Bill, which will extend the franchise for the university seats to more third-level institutions; and the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, which includes the provision that women in menopause will receive HRT medicines free of charge with annual savings of up to €800. The Seanad Electoral Bill was passed with a vote on the second-stage debate, postponed from Tuesday, and no discussion at all on the committee or remaining stages. TDs passed the Bill by 71 to 53 votes. The Dáil sits on Thursday but is then adjourned until Tuesday, November 5th, expected to be the final week of the 33rd Dáil. The Finance Bill, which gives effect to budgetary measures, will be rushed through the remaining stages that week and will be subject to guillotine. Government Chief Whip Hildegarde Naughton said on Wednesday night there were 11 Bills being progressed at present, and her expectation was that nine of these would go to the President for final approval. The two Bills not expected to become law before the Dáil is dissolved are the Defamation Bill and the Mental Health Bill. The remaining three Bills of the nine are all time-bound, according to Government sources. Ministers have been told that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill must be passed by the end of the year, or else it will not be in a position to operate. It provides for a three-year budget of €565 million for the Oireachtas, an increase of more than 20 per cent. Once votes on supplementary estimates are passed by the Dáil – necessary to authorise extra spending in several Government departments – the Appropriations Bill must also be passed that week to provide a legal underpinning for Government spending. There is also a Companies Enforcement Bill which will be debated and passed in the Oireachtas on November 6th.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald to run alongside Cllr Janice Boylan in Dublin Central Party expected set to have 65 to 70 candidates in general election with two-runner strategy per constituency Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald will run alongside Cllr Janice Boylan in Dublin Central as the party pursues a two-candidate strategy in the Sinn Féin leader’s constituency. Ms McDonald and Ms Boylan were unopposed in their candidacy. Moreover, it is understood the party has no intention of adding any further names to the ticket. While the duo have been close friends for some time, relations soured towards the end of 2022. Before Christmas of that year, Ms Boylan had written a letter to party members stating that she was “humiliated numerous times” and that the party had failed to support her. Although it later transpired that she had not ultimately resigned from the party, she wrote at the time that she could not stay “where I am not supported, valued or even really respected”. Ms McDonald subsequently tweeted a photograph of herself and Ms Boylan out walking in an indication that differences had been resolved. Ms Boylan had also written about how she had been overlooked for a role in Ms McDonald’s constituency office. “However, unfortunately, I was told I wasn’t successful. This has only further shown me what my reality has been for two years.” Afterwards, Sinn Féin said she remained a valued member of the party. The two have appeared numerous times at media events since then. Ms Boylan, from O’Devaney Gardens in Dublin 8 originally, is married with three children. Sinn Féin has not only decided to pursue a two-candidate strategy in Dublin Central but also in many other constituencies countrywide. The party is expected to run 65 to 70 candidates in the forthcoming general election. In the 2020 election, Sinn Féin was accused of running too few candidates as many of those who ran commanded huge votes with often multiple quotas which could have brought in a running mate. Yet in this summer’s local and European elections, the party commanded less than 12 per cent of the national vote and more than 200 councillors were unsuccessful. Asked recently about the party’s slide in polls, Ms McDonald said Sinn Féin is “well aware” of the work it needs to do, but is determined. She said the challenge is to “make it clear” that there is an alternative and choice in Irish politics. “We got the message to shape up, to get cracking, to be connected and vocal and we’re back now. We’ve worked hard over the summer and we are now coming back into this Dáil term with a real sense of renewed purpose and renewed determination,” she added.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week.

"Overhaul of Sinn Féin governance promised by Mary Lou McDonald as reference controversy grows  Michelle O’Neill apologises on behalf of Sinn Féin to the Northern Ireland Assembly over references provided for child sex offender Michael McMonagle Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said a “complete overhaul” of governance procedures will be initiated within the party, after two former party employees provided references for their ex-colleague Michael McMonagle, a former party press officer who has been convicted of child sex offences. Pressure has been building on Ms McDonald to address questions about the ongoing controversy after it emerged that Seán Mag Uidhir, an influential Sinn Féin figure who headed the party’s media operation in the North, and his colleague Caolán McGinley left Sinn Féin when it was revealed that they provided the references for McMonagle. Last month, McMonagle (42) from Limewood Street in Derry, pleaded guilty to two charges of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity, and 12 counts of attempted sexual communication with a child on dates from 2020 to 2021. McMonagle was suspended from his job with Sinn Féin after he was arrested in August 2021, and in September 2022 was appointed to the role of communications and engagement manager with the British Heart Foundation (BHF) in Belfast. It emerged last weekend that the BHF told a senior Sinn Féin official about the references in 2023. On Monday, Stormont’s First Minister Michelle O’Neill was summoned before the Northern Ireland Assembly to answer questions on the affair, where she said that the official whom the charity had contacted was Sinn Féin’s former human resources manager, who is still a member of the party. After days of scrutiny on the issue, Sinn Féin leader Ms McDonald issued a statement on Monday evening condemning the actions of the two former Sinn Féin members and promising an overhaul of governance structures within the party. “There must always be accountability for wrongdoing. That is why I took decisive action when I was made aware on Wednesday, 25th September, 2024, that two staff members had provided job references to Michael McMonagle. Those who gave these references in this case were guilty of gross misconduct and they no longer work for the party and are no longer members of the party. Their actions are unforgivable and absolutely unacceptable to me. “I am disgusted by the crimes of Michael McMonagle, who is facing the full rigours of the law. He was immediately suspended from the party and his employment when he was questioned by the PSNI in 2021, as required by our child protection and HR procedures. “The following year two of his co-workers in the Assembly provided references to him. I am shocked that anyone would have given him a reference, given the serious allegations and subsequent charges that he faced. This is unforgivable and absolutely unacceptable to me. This was done without consultation with the party. “I have asked the incoming general secretary to immediately initiate a complete overhaul of governance procedures within the party. We will do everything necessary to ensure that an incident like this never arises again. The general secretary will take external professional advice in this work.” Ms McDonald also said she would “ensure that there are clear processes so that there are no grey areas whatsoever where an individual has been suspended or ends their employment with Sinn Féin, to ensure that there are no future issues in relation to handing back work passes and to make absolutely clear that references cannot be provided by individual members of staff”. “I deeply regret that the British Heart Foundation has been caught up in an issue not of their making. They do incredibly important work and I look forward to continuing our work with them now and in the future. I apologise for the distress that has been caused by these events. I am committed to ensuring that an incident like this is never repeated again,” Ms McDonald said. Meanwhile, Ms O’Neill confirmed that a former Sinn Féin human resources manager who knew that references were provided for Michael McMonagle over a year ago – but failed to alert party leaders – is still a member of the party. The revelation emerged when Ms O’Neill was summoned before the Stormont Assembly on Monday. She also confirmed that the ex-employee oversaw the disciplinary process that led to McMonagle’s departure. The Irish Times asked Sinn Féin to detail when the HR manager left their job and why the individual retained their party membership. There was no response. The development follows a BHF statement at the weekend in which it confirmed the charity emailed a senior Sinn Féin HR official about the references for McMonagle in August 2023 as part an internal review of its recruitment process in hiring him. Ms O’Neill admitted on Saturday that the employee’s failure to inform her or the party leadership about the contact was a “serious omission”. During her appearance before the Assembly on Monday, Ms O’Neill insisted that the issue of child safeguarding is of “paramount importance” as the party continues to be criticised over its handling of McMonagle’s departure and how it dealt with the controversial fallout over the past week. Stormont leader of the opposition, SDLP MLA Matthew O’Toole, asked Ms O’Neill if the former HR manager was a still a party member and she confirmed this was the case. Speaking after the sitting, Mr O’Toole said the matter was “concerning” and raised “more unanswered questions”. Addressing the Assembly, Ms O’Neill said she was “deeply sorry” for the “reputational damage” caused to the BHF. “I want to be very, very clear that the issue of child safeguarding is of paramount importance to me and I will do everything that I can to ensure that a situation like this never arises again,” she said. She added: “As a mother and as a grandmother, I assert my absolute determination, both political and personal, to protecting all children and to protecting all other vulnerable people.” Ms O’Neill also on Monday apologised in the Assembly on behalf of Sinn Féin for the actions of the two former party employees who provided references for McMonagle. The hearing was called after a series of multiple urgent questions were tabled to Assembly Speaker Edwin Poots after the controversy. Mr Poots selected an urgent question from DUP MLA Diane Dodds which asked if the furore had diminished confidence in the First Minister’s office. Ms O’Neill repeatedly defended her position and when asked about a photograph of her standing just feet away from McMonagle at a BHF event in support of the ‘Donate4Daithí’ organ donation campaign in February last year, she insisted she was unaware he was present. “My sole focus was on Dáithí and supporting the family to raise awareness for the campaign,” Ms O’Neill said. “I was not aware that Michael McMonagle was at this event, and I had no knowledge that he had gained employment with the British Heart Foundation.” Earlier, Stormont Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly urged Sinn Féin to be open and transparent in response to questions around McMonagle. She told MLAs: “There are serious questions about the current situation that have to be answered and as leaders we have to be honest and we have to be credible, and I think very many people out there will feel it has simply not been credible thus far.” Meanwhile, the Assembly confirmed on Monday that McMonagle was paid out of Ms O’Neill’s staffing allowance between March and May 2020, at a time when she was Stormont Deputy First Minister. Parties can hire staff from Assembly funds provided to them centrally, or individual MLAs can hire them from their own staffing allowances.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.9233337293989473,False
"McDonald claims ‘very senior members’ of Coalition wrote character references for ‘convicted rapists and child abusers’  Sinn Féin leader was speaking after Government calls for Dáil statements from McDonald about press officer controversy Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has challenged the Government on their child protection policies and said that “very senior members” of Coalition parties have written character references for “convicted rapists and child abusers”. She said “transparency goes both ways” before reiterating that what happened in her party was “unacceptable and reprehensible”. Ms McDonald was speaking in the Dáil after Government Chief Whip Hildegarde Naughton said it was “only right” that the Oireachtas business committee should meet to arrange a time for statements on child protection after character references were given to a former Sinn Féin press officer under investigation for child sex offences. Ms Naughton said the Sinn Féin leadership team had “continued involvement with this person” afterwards. Ms McDonald said: “If the Government wants to schedule statements on the important issues of child protection and safeguarding, that’s in their gift. “I want to be clear that, for our part, these unauthorised references that you have referred to were unacceptable. They were reprehensible. Action has been taken. The two individuals concerned have lost their jobs. They are now no longer members of Sinn Féin, and that’s as it should be. “We take these matters very, very seriously indeed, and I have taken swift action by way of response.” She added: “In the course of our statements the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste the parties of Government will have to also make clear what sanctions they have adopted in cases where very senior members of your parties have written character references for convicted rapists and child abusers. “I will be interested to hear what action you took, and I’m sure that you will, you will avail of that opportunity more broadly and in response to the Order of Business. So we’ll wait and see what the Government will do on that, because transparency goes both ways ladies and gentlemen.” Labour leader Ivana Bacik said serious issues had arisen in relation to Sinn Féin’s handling of child abuse offences by an employee and time should be made available this week for statements on child protection issues “and the procedures within political parties for managing child protection issues.” Minister for Justice Helen McEntee who took the Order of Business, said time could be found to discuss the issue and “to make sure that every party has an opportunity to set out their procedure to ensure that child safety is absolutely paramount whether it’s a political party or any other type of organisation”. On Tuesday morning speaking to Pat Kenny on Newstalk Ms McDonald sought to lay the blame on the two men, Seán Mag Uidhir and Caolán McGinley, who gave the references and to shortcomings in the party’s HR office. “For the life of me I can’t explain to you how any rational person could consider giving him a reference,” she said. “They acted despicably.” She said that when Sinn Féin discovered about the references “the two individuals jumped before they were pushed”. Their actions were “unforgivable”, she said. She acknowledged the party’s HR department did not pass on queries about the references, citing “churn in staffing” and “an issue over maternity cover”. “We dropped the ball,” she said. “Sinn Féin dropped the ball.” She defended Northern First Minister Michelle O’Neill who said she had not noticed McMonagle when he attended an event in Stormont with a small number of people for the British Heart Foundation. “She didn’t see him,” Ms McDonald said. “She has answered that question.” She said to draw inferences about the culture of Sinn Féin from the events was “very unfair to people in the party”. Meanwhile, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have ramped up pressure on Sinn Féin amid the controversy over two of its former senior party officials giving a reference to a party press officer under investigation for child sex abuse. Junior ministers Jennifer Carroll MacNeill and Anne Rabbitte wrote to Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl calling for Dáil statements on the matter. Ms Carroll MacNeill said on Tuesday that there are “still very many unanswered questions from Sinn Féin in relation to their child protection processes”. Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl replied to the Ministers declining their request.

Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.9300512009593921,False
"Sinn Féin’s handling of sexual abuse a recurring issue for the party Party’s silent approach fails to prevent the difficult questions being asked Budget done, election looming and Sinn Féin finds itself in the midst of another political crisis, hounded for answers about a sex abuse scandal. It is becoming a recurring problem. So far, the party is scrambling to find credible answers in the North about its former press officer Michael McMonagle – who is facing child sex abuse charges – and the references supplied to him by party figures. But that’s unlikely to be sustainable. South of the Border, it was trying to keep its head down. But that became impossible, and party president Mary Lou McDonald issued a statement on Monday saying she had ordered “a complete overhaul of governance procedures” within the party. “We will do everything necessary to ensure that an incident like this never arises again,” she promised. But questions about how the party conducted itself are likely to continue until they have been answered. As Belfast Telegraph journalist Sam McBride told the BBC’s Stephen Nolan on Monday morning, these were reasonable questions and reasonable people expected answers. The political impact on Sinn Féin in the Republic comes in two ways. There’s the stink of the affair itself and then there’s the fact that it prevents the party from talking about the issues it wants to talk about. This weekend, Sinn Féin should have been talking about housing, and about how last week’s budget represented a short-term bribe for voters. But that couldn’t be done, to any effect. Because they don’t want to be asked questions that they can’t or don’t want to answer. So the party – as it did when it emerged that its former councillor Jonathan Dowdall was in fact a gangster pal of Gerry “the Monk” Hutch – goes to ground. Questions remain unanswered; the supply of Sinn Féin TDs on the Leinster House plinth dries up. At some point, these things always come down to a series of questions about who knew what and when. Sinn Féin claims it did not know that McMonagle – whom it removed in June 2022 – was subsequently working for the British Heart Foundation. This is despite the fact that two senior party officials, Seán Mag Uidhir and Caolán McGinley, had given him references. The foundation raised those references with an as yet unidentified “senior HR” person in the party a year ago. The two officials were sacked in the past two weeks, the party says. A visibly uncomfortable Roscommon TD Claire Kerrane was asked on RTÉ at the weekend where this HR officer was now. “I don’t know,” she replied. When did they resign? “I don’t know.” During the period when Sinn Féin says it did not know that McMonagle was working with the British Heart Foundation, he still had his Sinn Féin pass to get into Stormont. And he attended at least one event at Stormont, where he was part of a small delegation and was pictured within touching distance of Michelle O’Neill. She says she didn’t notice him – despite him previously being part of her personal staff. He attended a photocall with Sinn Féin Junior Minister Aisling Reilly. Nobody noticed him. He also attended an event in Westminster with Sinn Féin representatives, including MPs Paul Maskey and John Finucane. Again, nobody noticed. It may be true, if unlikely, that nobody in Sinn Féin noticed that the press officer accompanying the British Heart Foundation to its various events was the same press officer that until recently worked for the party and then was fired because he was being investigated for child sex abuse. Whether people believe that or not – and O’Neill told the Assembly at Stormont on Monday that she could understand if they didn’t – it will inevitably remind people of the cover-ups in the Liam Adams and Máiría Cahill cases. Failures to protect children and to deal with complaints of child sex abuse in Sinn Féin and the republican movement have already been laid bare in books by Cahill and by Aoife Grace Moore in recent years. In both cases, those failures went right to the top of the party. So this controversy will prompt more questions about the culture of the party – the secrecy, the military-style discipline, the loyalty to the party line above all – that Sinn Féin hoped voters had put aside. The culture – an understandable inheritance from the past, when the party was the political wing of a terrorist organisation dedicated to the overthrow of the State and the unification of the island by violent means – has often been a political advantage during the rise of Sinn Féin and its march towards power in Dublin. It is certainly often envied by its rivals. But it can also mean that people prioritise the party over everything; protecting the party is more important than telling the truth, or protecting victims of wrongdoing. This is an age where voters expect openness and transparency in many things. Dealing with child sexual abuse is certainly one of them.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department.

"McDonald directs ‘overhaul’ of Sinn Féin governance Move comes after party press officers provided references for ex-colleague convicted of child sex offences Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has ordered a “complete overhaul” of governance procedures within her party after two former party press officers provided references for their ex-colleague Michael McMonagle, who has been convicted of child sex offences. Pressure has been building on Ms McDonald to address questions about the ongoing controversy after it emerged that Seán Mag Uidhir, an influential and long-standing Sinn Féin figure who headed its media operation in the North, and his colleague, Caolán McGinley, left the party after it was revealed that they provided the references for McMonagle. Last month, McMonagle (42), from Limewood Street in Derry, pleaded guilty to two charges of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity and 12 counts of attempted sexual communication with a child on dates from 2020-21. He is due to be sentenced next month. McMonagle was suspended from his press officer job with Sinn Féin after he was arrested in August 2021, and in September 2022 was appointed to the role of communications manager with the British Heart Foundation (BHF) charity in Belfast. After days of scrutiny on the issue, Ms McDonald issued a statement condemning the actions of the two former Sinn Féin members and promising an overhaul of governance structures within the party. “There must always be accountability for wrongdoing. That is why I took decisive action when I was made aware on Wednesday, September 25th, 2024, that two staff members had provided job references to Michael McMonagle. Those who gave these references in this case were guilty of gross misconduct and they no longer work for the party and are no longer members of the party.” Ms McDonald said she had asked the party’s incoming general secretary to “immediately initiate a complete overhaul of governance procedures”. “We will do everything necessary to ensure that an incident like this never arises again. The general secretary will take external professional advice in this work.” It emerged at the weekend the BHF informed a senior Sinn Féin human resources (HR) manager in the North about the references in August last year. The manager failed to alert Sinn Féin First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the party leadership about the contact, which Ms O’Neill has admitted was a “serious omission”. Addressing the Stormont Assembly yesterday after multiple urgent questions were submitted about the affair, Ms O’Neill said the HR manager was no longer an employee but was still a party member. Sinn Féin did not respond to queries from The Irish Times about when the HR manager left his/her job and why he/she retained his/her party membership. The Stormont leader of the Opposition, SDLP MLA Matthew O’Toole, said the “concerning” development raises “more unanswered questions”. “It’s extremely unusual that the person remains a member of Sinn Féin. The other two members who provided references for McMonagle have been stripped of their membership. That’s clearly anomalous,” he said. “This person, from what we found out today, was not only aware of McMonagle’s arrest, they were involved in the disciplinary process that led to his suspension in 2021. I don’t know the individual’s identity but it is also concerning that we don’t know the circumstances around how they left. I welcome the fact that Michelle O’Neill gave some answers today but there are still many outstanding questions.” Addressing the Assembly, Ms O’Neill said she was “deeply sorry” for the “reputational damage” caused to the BHF. “I want to be very, very clear that the issue of child safeguarding is of paramount importance to me and I will do everything that I can to ensure that a situation like this never arises again,” she said. Ms McDonald also said she would “ensure that there are clear processes so that there are no grey areas whatsoever where an individual has been suspended or ends their employment with Sinn Féin, to ensure that there are no future issues in relation to handing back work passes and to make absolutely clear that references cannot be provided by individual members of staff”. Ministers from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have called on Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl to adjourn normal Dáil business to allow for statements to be made by Ms McDonald in relation to the controversy. Fine Gael Minister of State for EU Affairs Jennifer Carroll MacNeill and Fianna Fáil Minister of State for Disabilities Anne Rabbitte have written to Mr Ó Fearghaíl saying that “in light of very serious child protection issues in the public sphere” it is “imperative” that Ms McDonald should update the Dáil on the matter.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.9090645779715802,False
"Sinn Féin to face further questions over references for child sex offender  Opposition parties row in behind request to hear statements on child protection in Dáil, while the controversy is due to be discussed at Stormont scrutiny committee meeting Sinn Féin is set to face further questions over the level of knowledge within the party about references given by two former senior officials to an ex-colleague who has been convicted of child sex offences. Michael McMonagle (42) from Limewood Street in Derry last month pleaded guilty to two charges of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity, and 12 counts of attempted sexual communication with a child on dates in 2020 and 2021. He was suspended from his press officer job with Sinn Féin after he was arrested in August 2021, and in September 2022 was appointed to the role of communications manager with the British Heart Foundation (BHF) charity in Belfast. The party has been attempting to quell a growing controversy around the issue after it emerged employment references were provided for McMonagle by Seán Mag Uidhir, a long-standing Sinn Féin figure who headed its media operation in the North, and his colleague Caolán McGinley. The two officials left the party after it was revealed they had given the references. Sinn Féin has said the party leadership had become aware of the references only when a media query was received about it last month. However, last weekend it emerged the BHF had had an “email dialogue” with a Sinn Féin HR manager as part of an internal review into McMonagle’s recruitment. The emails state that the charity had received two references from the party almost a year earlier. The Irish Times has asked Sinn Féin on three occasions if the HR manager informed anyone in Sinn Féin of the contact from the BHF. The party has declined to answer the question directly. Northern First Minister Michelle O’Neill said on Monday the HR manager was the same person who managed the disciplinary process action and McMonagle’s suspension. The HR manager left their employment last March but remains a member of the party. Opposition parties on Tuesday rowed in behind a request from Government parties to hear statements on child protection in the Dáil, while the controversy is also due to be discussed at a meeting of a Stormont scrutiny committee on Wednesday. Fine Gael Minister of State for European Union affairs Jennifer Carroll MacNeill said Sinn Féin still had questions to answer in relation to child protection and the level of awareness within the party about the issues. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald appeared on Newstalk’s Pat Kenny show and RTÉ's Six One on Tuesday and attempted to draw a line under the controversy. She sought to lay the blame on the two men who gave the references while also citing shortcomings in the party’s HR office. “For the life of me I can’t explain to you how any rational person could consider giving him a reference,” she said. “They acted despicably.” She said the party’s HR department did not pass on queries about the references, citing “churn in staffing” and “an issue over maternity cover”. On RTÉ's Six One, she said “that piece of information did not get transmitted onwards”. Speaking in the Dáil on Tuesday, Ms McDonald challenged the Government on its child protection policies and said that “very senior members” of Coalition parties have written character references for “convicted rapists and child abusers”. She said “transparency goes both ways” before reiterating that what happened in her party was “unacceptable and reprehensible”. Ms O’Neill, meanwhile, she would engage with the Executive Office Committee, though this is not expected to take place before next week. The DUP MLA and committee member Brian Kingston said “the First Minister finally gave some answers when she addressed the Assembly on Monday. However, even despite the promise of openness, she avoided others and failed to respond to those posed by the media after she was brought before the Assembly.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits?

"Michelle O’Neill may be recalled by Stormont committee to answer more questions on Michael McMonagle controversy MLAs seeking legal advice on whether Sinn Féin First Minister can appear before them without DUP Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly  The Stormont committee which scrutinises the Executive Office is to seek legal advice on inviting First Minister Michelle O’Neill to appear before it again to answer additional questions about the Michael McMonagle controversy. Members of the Executive Office committee agreed on Wednesday to seek advice on whether Ms O’Neill and her Sinn Féin colleague, junior Minister Aisling Reilly, could appear before them without Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly and junior Minister Pam Cameron, both DUP politicians, and the remit of potential questions. All four Ministers appeared before the committee a week ago, when Ms O’Neill took questions for the first time after it emerged two Sinn Féin press officers provided references for a former colleague who was subsequently convicted of child sex offences. Seán Mag Uidhir, an influential Sinn Féin figure who headed the party’s media operation in the North, and his colleague Caolán McGinley quit last month after it was revealed they provided the references for McMonagle, another former party press officer. The 42-year-old, from Limewood Street in Derry, has pleaded guilty to two charges of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity, and 12 counts of attempted sexual communication with a child on dates from 2020-21. McMonagle was suspended from his job with Sinn Féin after he was arrested in August 2021, and in September 2022 was appointed to the role of communications and engagement manager with the British Heart Foundation in Belfast. The charges against him became public in July 2023, and he was suspended and then dismissed by the charity. Ms O’Neill has since apologised for the “hurt and distress caused by their actions” and the Sinn Féin president, Mary Lou McDonald, has ordered a “complete overhaul” of governance procedures within the party. At Wednesday’s committee session Sinn Féin Assembly member (MLA) Carál Ní Chuilín said she had “no issue with anybody getting called back, I just think it’s either the four Ministers or it’s none, because that just, for me, makes a mockery of the joint office. “I want to get legal advice on the callback, should it be two or four, and the legal advice on what issues pending from last week that they can answer, because some of this stuff I think is starting to get a bit blurred.” The DUP MLA Brian Kingston said that at last week’s meeting, “essentially the First Minister was saying the fault lay with two press officers who have been sacked. Since then it has got to the stage where the First Minister has apologised to the British Heart Foundation, accepted the errors her party made. That change in position has only come about through scrutiny, scrutiny by this committee, the media, by the Assembly. “The First Minister is embroiled in a safeguarding failure and a safeguarding scandal and we do have to act.” SDLP MLA Sinéad McLaughlin said she supported the return of all four Ministers to the committee, saying: “I feel we have lost a wee bit of our moral duty until we get this resolved.” Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) MLA Timothy Gaston said: “We need some transparency, there hasn’t been any transparency to date ... the First Minister’s reputation and that of the Executive Office is in tatters because of that.” Independent unionist MLA Claire Sugden agreed the recall of Ministers could only be done on a legal basis. “My concern is that if we bring them back on issues which we legally can’t, then they have every right to say no. “We need to be clear about what we can ask them and what we can’t.” The committee chair, Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw, said she had asked the clerk to reach out to the British Heart Foundation to offer it the opportunity to appear before the committee, but the charity had declined. “They said they’d just like to draw a line under it after they issued their statement.” – Additional reporting: PA",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.862576438380011,False
"Sinn Féin’s US political arm raises €366,000 in latest fundraising drive  Major building companies and subcontractors in New York and New Jersey among biggest donors to Friends of Sinn Féin Sinn Féin’s US fundraising arm, Friends of Sinn Féin, has raised a further €366,000 in donations, mostly from donors in the New York area building sector, new filings to the US Department of Justice show. The Irish party’s US political arm is required to disclose its activities and fundraising under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act as an agent of Sinn Féin and lodges filings every six months. The latest filing, for the six-month reporting period to the end of October, shows that Friends of Sinn Féin raised $346,000 (€327,000) from four- and five-figure US dollar donations, largely coming from construction and building subcontracting businesses in New York and New Jersey. A further $41,000 (€39,000) was raised from small, online donations, which Friends of Sinn Féin president Mark Guilfoyle, a US attorney based in Kentucky, said “continue to be robust”. The six-month filing shows that the largest single donation was $20,000 from Eurotech Construction, a New York-based company founded by Co Tyrone native Fay Devlin, a long-time and generous financial supporter of Sinn Féin who also provides the political group office space, rent free, in the US. Eurotech and Friends of Sinn Féin have offices at 1212 Avenue of the Americas, a short distance from the Rockefeller Centre and St Patrick’s Cathedral in midtown Manhattan. There were more than a dozen individual contributions of $10,000 in the six-month period. The largest expense incurred by the group was $119,700 on an annual fundraising golf event at Hudson National Golf Club in New York in September. A further $35,000 was spent on travel expenses. Part of the purpose of the funding raised by the organisation is to cover the travel expenses of senior party figures who visit Washington and other American cities for political and civic meetings annually. Friends of Sinn Féin is active in briefing US politicians on political developments, the push for Irish unification and the Northern Ireland peace process. It regularly lists briefings with US politicians in the filings with the US Department of Justice in Washington, DC. The group held a “Unity Summit” in March in the Great Hall of the Cooper Union in Manhattan that was attended by party leader Mary Lou McDonald. Mr Guilfoyle told The Irish Times in a statement that the group’s engagement with “activists” during the reporting period was “fuelled by intense interest in Irish unity”. The latest fundraising haul by the group marks an increase on the 2023 October filings, which showed $320,000 raised, but falls considerably short of the $461,000 raised in 2022. The latest Friends of Sinn Féin filing was made as the Irish-American organisation mourned the death of Pat Donaghy, a major donor to the party who emigrated to the US from Co Tyrone in the 1950s. He co-founded the US building giant, Structure Tone, in 1971, which has become a major international firm. The company is listed as a donor of $10,000 in the latest Friends of Sinn Féin six-month filing. The statement issued by Mr Guilfoyle praised the late Tyrone man as “as a loving husband, father and grandfather. His friends will remember him for his loyalty, support and generosity”. “We in Friends of Sinn Féin will remember him as a proud Irish patriot who stood on the side of peace, justice and Irish unity,” the group said.",-1,-1_northern_uk_dup_stormont,"['northern', 'uk', 'dup', 'stormont', 'posters', 'north', 'return', 'election', 'new', 'dáil']","['Irish unity in ‘touching distance’ after DUP vote, says McDonald Recall of the Assembly to elect Speaker could take place as early as Saturday Irish unity is within “touching distance” as a nationalist First Minister at Stormont is poised to come into office for the first time, according to Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Reacting to the DUP’s endorsement of a deal with the UK government that will end its two-year boycott of the powersharing Executive, Ms McDonald said the elevation of party vice-president Michelle O’Neill to the head of the North’s devolved government will be a moment of “very great significance”. The recall of the Assembly to elect a Speaker could take place as early as Saturday and DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson signalled on Tuesday his optimism that there are enough concessions to show that the “naysayers are wrong”. The deal is due to be published on Wednesday and Ms O’Neill said the next number of days are crucial to get the powersharing institutions up and running. Addressing media at Stormont, Ms McDonald alluded to previous political arrangements in Northern Ireland, saying: “I think a Sinn Féin First Minister, and Michelle coming into office as First Minister, for all really is the most striking evidence that that era is now gone; it is now consigned to the pages of the history books. “And more importantly it signals now the new Ireland emerging and the conversation around a new constitutional dispensation, ending partition, Irish unity, all of the opportunity that presents is in many ways embodied in this moment of Michelle O’Neill becoming First Minister here.” Ms McDonald added “I think that the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. And I think that’s a very exciting thing.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 when its former first minister Paul Givan quit the executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Donaldson admitted on Tuesday that they had not secured “everything” they had sought from London in relation to changes to the Windsor Framework deal struck between UK and EU last year. However, he said he had achieved a “good outcome for Northern Ireland” and pledged “zero” checks on goods and paperwork works destined for the North - through the “green lane” element of the Windsor Framework – from Britain. “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told reporters outside Stormont. Asked about a timeline for Stormont’s return, he said it was conditional upon the UK government “delivering on their side” but that he hoped it will happen quickly. DUP party discipline remained tight on Tuesday after Monday evening’s DUP executive meeting led to an internal party inquiry when details of Mr Donaldson’s briefing to 130 members were leaked by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Bryson live tweeted details in what he claimed was a “blow by blow account” of the five-hour meeting. Despite Mr Donaldson’s claims on Tuesday that there will be legal changes to the post-Brexit deal, Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris played down the prospect of fresh negotiations with the EU and said that “all conditions are now in place” for a return of the Executive. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was adamant that the Windsor Framework deal will not be changed “one sentence” and that the so-called Irish Sea Border will “still be there”. Mr Beattie expressed concern that the situation could “unravel” in coming days if the Assembly is not restored by Monday. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long told reporters it was a “bittersweet” day in that there was nothing in the DUP deal with the UK that “wasn’t available in 2018 under Theresa May”.', 'UK government publishes deal which will set stage for Stormont return Safeguarding the Union document was released online by the UK government on Wednesday  The text of the legislation which secured the DUP’s return to power-sharing in the North has been published. The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was released online by the UK government on Wednesday afternoon. The measures outlined in the document by the UK government include, as previously signalled, legislation “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the Union” and which amends the UK Internal Market Act 2020 to “guarantee Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the UK’s internal market.” It will also end dynamic alignment with EU law. Legislative change will “recognise the end of the automatic pipeline of EU law”; Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will be amended, “reflecting the new reality that the law which applies in Northern Ireland is now properly subject to the democratic oversight of the Northern Ireland Assembly through the Stormont Brake and the democratic consent mechanism.” The so-called Green Lane will be replaced with a UK internal market system, and the UK government “will commit that more than 80 per cent of all freight movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland take place under the UK internal market system, with independent scrutiny.” This will ensure “there will be no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks.” There will be a legal requirement that new legislation will be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, if so, for ministers to make a statement considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.” The document includes more than 20 provisions, which includes the creation of an Independent Monitoring Panel to “provide oversight of the implementation of new arrangements”, the creation of a UK East-West Council and the publication of operational arrangements for the Stormont Brake. The UK government will also “pursue an agreement with the EU on a long-term basis” to ensure the continued supply of necessary veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland beyond 2025. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said  before it was published that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. His party has been using a veto power to block Stormont’s devolved institutions for almost two years in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, Mr Donaldson announced earlier this week that his party was prepared to return to Stormont, dependent on the UK government implementing the various legislative assurances and other measures it has offered. This is expected to lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland within days and will see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill become the North’s first ever nationalist first minister. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return,” he said on Tuesday. The return of Stormont will also see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland. The financial package includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Mr Donaldson said the deal would represent a “significant change” in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit’s so-called Irish Sea border. He said: “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. “On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.” Sinn Féin has focused on the imminent return of the Stormont Assembly, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald stating that Irish unity is now within “touching distance” as she hailed the significance of her party assuming the role of Stormont first minister for the first time. Ms McDonald said the expected appointment of Ms O’Neill in the coming days would be a moment of “very great significance”. Mr Donaldson announced his support for a Stormont return after receiving the “decisive” backing of the 130-strong party executive during a five-hour meeting on Monday night. He said DUP party officers, a key 12-strong decision-making body, had also “mandated” him to move forward on the basis he was proposing. Support for the deal is not unanimous within the DUP and several senior figures remain opposed to the proposed agreement. - PA', 'Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024. In years to come, much will be made of the significance of this day. It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,False
"Michelle O’Neill to break new ground by attending Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Belfast Sinn Fein vice president says attendance will show she is a ‘First Minister for all’ Stormont’s First Minister Michelle O’Neill is to participate in the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at Belfast City Hall – the first time a senior Sinn Féin figure will take part in such an event in Northern Ireland. The Sinn Féin vice-president said her attendance was a demonstration of her determination to fulfil her pledge to be a “First Minister for all”. Ms O’Neill, who will lay a laurel wreath at the Cenotaph in Belfast in her role as First Minister, will attend with DUP Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly. The First Minister said she appreciated some republicans would be “uncomfortable” with her being there, but she insisted it was nevertheless the “right thing to do”. “Back in February, it was a moment of progress and equality here when I became the first nationalist, republican First Minister and I made very firm pledges at that time that I would represent everybody in society,” she said. “So when I got this invitation to attend remembrance events this weekend, I thought it was important to take that invitation up because that for me is the fulfilment of my commitment to those people out there from a British and unionist identity who hold this important Remembrance Day very carefully to their own heart. “So, for me, this is about acknowledgment of loss, but it’s also about being respectful to all those people out there and fulfilling my commitment to be First Minister for all.” She added: “I think it’s going to be an uncomfortable thing for many republicans out there. I mean I think that’s understandable. “But, you know, I pledged to be a First Minister for all. I think it’s important at times like this, not least when you take a look around the world and what’s happening, the conflict, the world at war with itself, not least what’s happening in Palestine and the genocide of people there, that people need to lead. “I am a leader. I’m a First Minister for everybody in this society.” Sinn Féin’s approach to remembrance events linked to the British armed forces has evolved gradually since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, beginning in 2002 when the then Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Belfast Alex Maskey laid a laurel wreath at the Cenotaph at City Hall on the July anniversary of the Battle of the Somme. The republican party has gone on to participate in Armistice ceremonies in Belfast while Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald and Ms O’Neill have both attended an annual church service in St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin to mark Remembrance Sunday. In 2016, the late Martin McGuinness, who was then Stormont Deputy First Minister, visited two first World War battle sites – the Somme in France and Flanders in Belgium. The former IRA commander turned political leader said the visits were made in the “spirit of reconciliation”. However, until now, the party’s leadership has declined to participate in Remembrance Sunday ceremonies in Northern Ireland, previously citing concerns about excessive British military trappings on show at the events. Remembrance Sunday also holds an added significance in the context of the Troubles, due to the IRA’s notorious bomb attack in Enniskillen in Co Fermanagh in 1987. The no-warning blast at the town’s war memorial, as crowds gathered for the annual ceremony, killed 11 people – with a 12th victim dying years later having never woken from a coma. Asked about how IRA victims may respond to her attendance on Sunday, Ms O’Neill said: “I’ve said it now on a few occasions that I regret every single loss of life. There’s nothing poetic or romantic about war. War is horrible. People lost loved ones, and for this weekend in particular, I think it’s important, because this is, for me, about an acknowledgment of all loss.” She said: “I’m always comfortable in saying that I am sorry that any single person lost their life in conflict. But, for me, this is an opportunity this weekend to demonstrate that commitment to a shared society, that shared understanding of acceptance in terms of remembrance, that acceptance in terms of the fact that we have a contested past in many ways and contested narratives in many ways as well. But for me, this is about leadership.” Asked about families whose loved ones were killed by British soldiers during the Troubles, and how they might respond to her attendance, the First Minister spoke of a desire to “create space” for everyone to remember their dead. “We’re 26 years post the Good Friday Agreement and our own peace agreement, and how precious that is to us all,” she said. “I also contend that everybody has a right to remember their dead, and I think we need to create the space for all of our people out there to remember their dead in a way that they feel is respectful and appropriate to them. Let’s create space for each other.” Ms O’Neill’s move comes 14 years after then Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny became the first Taoiseach to attend a Remembrance Day service in Northern Ireland when he took part in commemorations at Enniskillen in 2012. He began a tradition that has been continued by Mr Kenny’s successors as Irish premier. Their attendance has been symbolic of the greater recognition now afforded in the Republic of Ireland to those Irishmen who fought and died serving in the British Army in the first World War. Ms O’Neill’s announcement comes in the week when the date of the forthcoming Irish general election will be announced. She insisted her decision was not linked to electoral politics south of the border. “Since I pledged to be a First Minister for all, I’ve lived up to that commitment at every turn,” she said. “I intend to take that opportunity at every turn to represent everybody fairly equally and in a very inclusive way in our society. This, to me, is about nothing else other than fulfilling that commitment to be First Minister for all.” Sinn Féin has been reeling from a series of controversies in recent weeks linked to its handling of allegations against several party members. Ms O’Neill denied her announcement was an attempt to shift the focus away from the party’s internal difficulties. “I’m going to have no truck with that,” she said of the suggestion. “I took this initiative because I believe it’s the right thing to do. I believe it is a fulfilment of my commitment to be First Minister for all. “We can’t escape the fact the past number of weeks have been difficult for the party, and I’ve publicly stated all of that in terms of the public record. “But this is not about that. This is about me fulfilling my commitment to be First Minister for all.” – PA",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.3872062888688482,False
"General election posters for Cork candidates vandalised by having faces cut out Incident took place overnight, spanning some 25km across Cork South-West constituency from Innishannon to Clonakilty Candidates in the Cork South-West constituency are counting the cost this weekend after vandals struck overnight and caused thousands of euros worth of damage when they defaced election posters from a large number of candidates by cutting out their faces. The vandals struck on Thursday and Friday night, defacing posters from Innishannon at the eastern end of the sprawling three seat constituency all the way to outside Clonakilty in the middle of the constituency some 25km away. Posters were also around Bandon and Kinsale as well as in Ballinadee, Gaggin and Timoleague with candidates from all the main parties and some independents being targeted and their faces carefully cut out. Among those whose posters were defaced were those of sitting TDs, Holly Cairns of the Social Democrats and Christopher O’Sulllivan of Fianna Fáil as well as those of Fine Gael candidate, Noel O’Donovan, Independent Cllr Alan Coleman and Evie Nevin of the Labour Party. Ms Nevin from Dunmanway condemned the vandalism and said, while she would prefer not to use posters and instead use some central notice  board for all candidates in each town, she felt compelled to use posters given that other candidates are continuing to use them. “Last night, someone drove at least 20km and vandalised campaign posters, cutting out the faces on mine and those of other candidates ... I have only 300 posters for the entire constituency – the bare minimum, many of which are reused from the last election.” Mr Coleman from Bandon also condemned  the incident, reckoning that up to 50 of his posters all around Bandon and further west have defaced in the past two nights. He said he is bracing himself for further attacks from the culprit he has named “The Poster Bandit”. “I’ve had a lot of them to Clonakilty into Timoleague and back into Bandon vandalised with the faces cut out – it was initially done of Thursday night but the Gaggin area outside Bandon was hit last night – it takes a bit of effort to cover that sort of ground. “And the faces are cut all the way through so somebody put a work into it and those posters don’t come cheap, you could be paying €5 euros or more for a poster and with so many candidates’ posters being targeted, the damage bill won’t be long clocking up.”",-1,-1_northern_uk_dup_stormont,"['northern', 'uk', 'dup', 'stormont', 'posters', 'north', 'return', 'election', 'new', 'dáil']","['Irish unity in ‘touching distance’ after DUP vote, says McDonald Recall of the Assembly to elect Speaker could take place as early as Saturday Irish unity is within “touching distance” as a nationalist First Minister at Stormont is poised to come into office for the first time, according to Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Reacting to the DUP’s endorsement of a deal with the UK government that will end its two-year boycott of the powersharing Executive, Ms McDonald said the elevation of party vice-president Michelle O’Neill to the head of the North’s devolved government will be a moment of “very great significance”. The recall of the Assembly to elect a Speaker could take place as early as Saturday and DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson signalled on Tuesday his optimism that there are enough concessions to show that the “naysayers are wrong”. The deal is due to be published on Wednesday and Ms O’Neill said the next number of days are crucial to get the powersharing institutions up and running. Addressing media at Stormont, Ms McDonald alluded to previous political arrangements in Northern Ireland, saying: “I think a Sinn Féin First Minister, and Michelle coming into office as First Minister, for all really is the most striking evidence that that era is now gone; it is now consigned to the pages of the history books. “And more importantly it signals now the new Ireland emerging and the conversation around a new constitutional dispensation, ending partition, Irish unity, all of the opportunity that presents is in many ways embodied in this moment of Michelle O’Neill becoming First Minister here.” Ms McDonald added “I think that the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. And I think that’s a very exciting thing.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 when its former first minister Paul Givan quit the executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Donaldson admitted on Tuesday that they had not secured “everything” they had sought from London in relation to changes to the Windsor Framework deal struck between UK and EU last year. However, he said he had achieved a “good outcome for Northern Ireland” and pledged “zero” checks on goods and paperwork works destined for the North - through the “green lane” element of the Windsor Framework – from Britain. “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told reporters outside Stormont. Asked about a timeline for Stormont’s return, he said it was conditional upon the UK government “delivering on their side” but that he hoped it will happen quickly. DUP party discipline remained tight on Tuesday after Monday evening’s DUP executive meeting led to an internal party inquiry when details of Mr Donaldson’s briefing to 130 members were leaked by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Bryson live tweeted details in what he claimed was a “blow by blow account” of the five-hour meeting. Despite Mr Donaldson’s claims on Tuesday that there will be legal changes to the post-Brexit deal, Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris played down the prospect of fresh negotiations with the EU and said that “all conditions are now in place” for a return of the Executive. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was adamant that the Windsor Framework deal will not be changed “one sentence” and that the so-called Irish Sea Border will “still be there”. Mr Beattie expressed concern that the situation could “unravel” in coming days if the Assembly is not restored by Monday. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long told reporters it was a “bittersweet” day in that there was nothing in the DUP deal with the UK that “wasn’t available in 2018 under Theresa May”.', 'UK government publishes deal which will set stage for Stormont return Safeguarding the Union document was released online by the UK government on Wednesday  The text of the legislation which secured the DUP’s return to power-sharing in the North has been published. The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was released online by the UK government on Wednesday afternoon. The measures outlined in the document by the UK government include, as previously signalled, legislation “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the Union” and which amends the UK Internal Market Act 2020 to “guarantee Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the UK’s internal market.” It will also end dynamic alignment with EU law. Legislative change will “recognise the end of the automatic pipeline of EU law”; Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will be amended, “reflecting the new reality that the law which applies in Northern Ireland is now properly subject to the democratic oversight of the Northern Ireland Assembly through the Stormont Brake and the democratic consent mechanism.” The so-called Green Lane will be replaced with a UK internal market system, and the UK government “will commit that more than 80 per cent of all freight movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland take place under the UK internal market system, with independent scrutiny.” This will ensure “there will be no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks.” There will be a legal requirement that new legislation will be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, if so, for ministers to make a statement considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.” The document includes more than 20 provisions, which includes the creation of an Independent Monitoring Panel to “provide oversight of the implementation of new arrangements”, the creation of a UK East-West Council and the publication of operational arrangements for the Stormont Brake. The UK government will also “pursue an agreement with the EU on a long-term basis” to ensure the continued supply of necessary veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland beyond 2025. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said  before it was published that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. His party has been using a veto power to block Stormont’s devolved institutions for almost two years in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, Mr Donaldson announced earlier this week that his party was prepared to return to Stormont, dependent on the UK government implementing the various legislative assurances and other measures it has offered. This is expected to lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland within days and will see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill become the North’s first ever nationalist first minister. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return,” he said on Tuesday. The return of Stormont will also see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland. The financial package includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Mr Donaldson said the deal would represent a “significant change” in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit’s so-called Irish Sea border. He said: “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. “On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.” Sinn Féin has focused on the imminent return of the Stormont Assembly, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald stating that Irish unity is now within “touching distance” as she hailed the significance of her party assuming the role of Stormont first minister for the first time. Ms McDonald said the expected appointment of Ms O’Neill in the coming days would be a moment of “very great significance”. Mr Donaldson announced his support for a Stormont return after receiving the “decisive” backing of the 130-strong party executive during a five-hour meeting on Monday night. He said DUP party officers, a key 12-strong decision-making body, had also “mandated” him to move forward on the basis he was proposing. Support for the deal is not unanimous within the DUP and several senior figures remain opposed to the proposed agreement. - PA', 'Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024. In years to come, much will be made of the significance of this day. It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,False
"Pause on Syrian asylum claims to be reviewed in coming weeks, says Helen McEntee Minister for Justice says fall of Assad regime ‘really positive’ but it is not clear what will happen next in Syria A temporary pause placed on making final decisions on requests for asylum from people who fled to the State from Syria will be reviewed in the coming weeks, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. The assessment of fewer than 400 applications from Syrians are impacted by the move, with final rulings on their asylum claims now on hold.  “This is not a long-term pause as far as I’m concerned, but we do need to see how things transpire in the weeks ahead,” Ms McEntee said. The Department of Justice this week paused decisions on asylum cases involving people from Syria following the collapse of the autocratic regime of Bashar al-Assad after a 13-year-long civil war. The fall of the brutal regime took international leaders by surprise, with Syrian opposition forces, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, quickly advancing across the country and seizing the capital of Damascus in recent days. “I really welcome the end of the Assad regime,” Ms McEntee said. “This is a regime that worked with fear and violence and control and I think the Syrian people now have an opportunity to set their own future and their own pathway.” The Minister said decisions on whether to grant asylum or refugee status had to take into account the current situation in an applicant’s country of origin.  “What I’ve done simply is pause any decision-making on the basis that it is uncertain as to what the situation may be in the weeks ahead. Any decision has to be made based on what is happening in that country of origin at that time,” she said. Ms McEntee was speaking on her way into a meeting of EU justice ministers in Brussels, at which matters including the future of Syrian refugees and asylum seekers are to be discussed. More than one million Syrians fleeing the civil war and Assad regime came to Europe over the last decade. A number of EU states, such as France, Germany, Belgium and Italy, have also paused decisions in pending asylum cases for Syrians. The Austrian government, known for its hardline approach to migration, has in recent days raised the prospect of organising a programme of “orderly repatriation and deportation” to send asylum seekers back to Syria.  Ms McEntee said Ireland was not considering any similar scheme. “It’s important that we do work together and that we work, where possible, in step on this issue,” she said. “I think it’s really positive that the Assad regime has come to an end. At the same time I think we can all see that it’s not clear what will happen next.”",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,False
"‘Not inevitable’ Independents will be in new government, say Social Democrats Cian O’Callaghan says Social Democrats will continue discussions with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil into new year A coalition between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Independents is not inevitable and other options are still to be explored, the acting leader of the Social Democrats has said. Cian O’Callaghan has said his party will continue its discussions with the two outgoing Government parties into January. There has been “recognition” from both parties, he added, of the Social Democrats’ red-line issues, including disability, Sláintecare, child care and housing. “I’m not going to take away from what is very apparent - that a Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Independents government could well be formed later in January,” said Mr O’Callaghan, who has assumed the leadership of the party during the maternity leave of leader Holly Cairns. “I am not disputing this but I don’t think that’s an inevitable outcome. My sense is that there are other options and they are being explored.” In an interview with The Irish Times, Mr O’Callaghan said that there had been engagement on issues that the party  considers to be key. “There has been a serious recognition of disability as an issue,” he said. “There’s a lot of work that needs to be done in that area. I think that is recognised. It is something that Holly [Cairns], in particular, has been raising consistently. “I think there is growing recognition across the political spectrum that we’re falling very far short of the kind of support and services that are needed. I think there is growing momentum on that. “How that translates in the next government will remain to be seen. I do think there’s general acceptance and recognition that we could and must be doing much better in the area of disability.” A delegation from the party met Fine Gael late last week and has planned a further meeting with Fianna Fáil in early January. Its parliamentary party will also meet after Christmas to take stock of progress. “The parliamentary party is going to go through in detail the issues that we’ve been discussing with the other parties, and in detail where we feel that there’s areas that we may be able to agree, where we feel there’s areas where there may be disagreements, areas that may be open to negotiations. “We will get feedback from the members of the parliamentary party at that meeting. Getting the input from all the TDs is an important part of the process for us.” He said there was a responsibility on his party to engage seriously with other parties, including those with different perspectives and views. “You have to accept that elections inevitably don’t have the ideal outcome for any party. Coalition governments and multiparty [arrangements] have become part of the landscape in Ireland. What changes you can produce out of that process that will make people’s lives better is what politics is really about.” Significantly, Mr O’Callaghan, a TD for Dublin Bay North, downplayed the prospect of a pact or an alliance with other parties in the event of the Social Democrats going into opposition. “While we are always open to talking to, and co-operating with, other parties, we have a mandate to stand on our own two feet. So, in terms of any more formal arrangements we would not necessarily see that come to pass, although we are open to working constructively with other parties. Mr O’Callaghan was also asked about the suspension of Dublin Bay South TD Eoin Hayes, who misled the party about when he disposed of shares in a company that supplied military technology to Israel. He said the national executive will review all the circumstances and said the question as to if and when Mr Hayes would be allowed return did not arise at this moment. “There’s no question that mistakes were made but we have learned from them and that’s important,” he said.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Immigration during 2024: The year in numbers Daily arrivals have dropped, but the number of asylum applications has increased significantly In the first week of January 2024, there were 26,473 international protection applicants (IPAs), including 5,758 children, living in State-provided accommodation. An average of 47 people were arriving per day and 376 male asylum seekers were homeless. Arrivals have dropped since October – there’s an average of 29 arriving now each day. However, close to 17,600 asylum applications were submitted by the end of November, significantly higher than the total of 13,277 requests made last year. By mid December 2024, there were 32,619 IPAs, including 9,011 children, in State-provided accommodation. In mid-December, 3,010 male asylum seekers were homeless. In August, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee announced the addition of five new countries to the State’s ‘safe’ list. The list of 15 countries is used to fast-track asylum applications and dissuade people from coming here. Civil society groups said they were concerned the list was a “misuse” of legislation, and Amnesty International was “appalled” by the decision to include Egypt given the country’s poor human rights record. In August, the High Court ruled the State’s failure to meet the basic needs of IPAs experiencing homelessness was in breach of the UN’s charter of fundamental rights, in a case taken by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. The State lodged an appeal against the judgment in November. As the war in Ukraine has raged on, refugees continue to arrive into Ireland. Around 112,761 Ukrainian refugees have arrived here since February 2022, although 25 per cent of these have since left. More than 29,800 live in State-provided housing, while 22,590 live in pledged accommodation or are hosted by Irish people. Earlier this year, the Government launched a revised accommodation strategy for IPAs that acknowledged the need to move away from a “wholly reactive response” and full reliance on commercial providers. It committed to “rebuild confidence” among the general public, with “fair and equal distribution” of accommodation. The State is reportedly now in discussions to buy Dublin’s Citywest Hotel, which has become a key property for accommodating asylum seekers. Cape Wrath Hotel Unlimited, which is owned by Tetrarch Capital and runs the hotel, has been the biggest recipient of State funds for accommodation in recent years. The State spent €913 million on accommodation for IPAs and Ukrainian refugees during the first half of this year. The total annual bill is expected to reach €1.9 billion.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.9531690732469283,False
"Sinn Féin Stormont minister Conor Murphy to run for Seanad next month Surprise announcement would see economy minister depart from post if elected Stormont economy minister and veteran Sinn Féin politician Conor Murphy will run for election to the Seanad next month, the party has confirmed. The surprise announcement came on Monday with party leader Mary Lou McDonald endorsing Mr Murphy, saying he will bring “unparalleled political and ministerial experience” to the role. With more than 30 years’ experience as a councillor, MP, and MLA for Newry and Armagh, the South Armagh-born man is one of Sinn Féin’s most senior representatives. It is understood he will step down from his high-profile ministerial job if elected. It is not yet known who will replace him in the party’s Assembly and Executive line-up. He previously held two ministerial posts, in finance and regional development. As one of the party’s key negotiators with the British and Irish governments throughout the peace process, Mr Murphy insisted that he remains committed to his current role but would “relish the challenge” if elected to the Seanad. “I’ve been elected to Stormont since 1998 and but for a couple of years as MP, I’ve been there ever since – so of course I will miss that and I’ve very much enjoyed doing the economy brief,” he told The Irish Times. “But this is a time where the key burning question for us, and everybody who lives on this island, is what does the constitutional future hold. A lot of that debate is going to focus on the Oireachtas. Many of the parties who stood for election have indicated they want to step up activity in that area. “I think my own experience on this side of the border and my experience in office as a negotiator over many years dealing with various governments can make a contribution to help shape that debate, and to hopefully put a plan in place for constitutional change which will lead us to a referendum and to self-determination. “That’s why I got into politics in the first instance, that’s what sustains me in politics and that’s work that I now have an opportunity to try and focus on in the time ahead.” The move follows internal controversies that have rocked the party in recent months, including the circumstances surrounding the departure of former Sinn Féin senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, who resigned on mental health grounds a year ago. In October, the party was criticised following revelations around inappropriate texts sent by Mr Ó Donnghaile to a teenage party member. Ms McDonald subsequently apologised for her tribute to Mr Ó Donnghaile following his resignation. Speaking in Dublin on Monday, Ms McDonald said Mr Murphy’s candidacy “underscores the party’s commitment to representing the entire island of Ireland, promoting the all-Ireland economy, and advancing the Irish unity debate in the Oireachtas”. “Conor brings a huge wealth of experience as the party now continues to build our All-Ireland political project. He has been a consistent champion for the All-Ireland economy, infrastructure and connectivity representing a border constituency,” she said. “He played a key role in the negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement and has been central to every major political negotiation and delivery since. As Sinn Féin’s chief negotiator, he has decades of experience working with both the Irish and British governments and engaging with political unionism, and key sectors north and south.” Ms McDonald confirmed that Mr Murphy will continue serving as a member of the Assembly and Economy Minister until the Seanad election concludes, “after which we will assess the next steps”.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Academics warn of facial recognition technology’s ‘chilling effects’ and potential social harm An Garda Síochána has previously stressed limitations of intended application in Ireland and potential to improve investigations Concerns about the potential use of facial recognition technology (FRT) by An Garda Síochána have been raised by a number of specialist academics who warned of its “chilling effects” and potential social harms. An Oireachtas committee hearing expert insights on the technology was also told of likely legal challenges should its use be adopted in the context of current draft legislation, and of the importance of judicial, rather than police, oversight. Although An Garda Síochána has stressed the limitations of its intended application in Ireland, and of its potential to radically improve investigative procedures in crimes including child exploitation, the Oireachtas justice committee was presented with successive witness concerns during a meeting on Tuesday. “If Ireland goes ahead with this technology it’s just a matter of time before we become a headline,” said Dr Abeba Birhane of the School of Computer Science and Statistics at Trinity College Dublin, who warned of its tendency to err along minority group lines, a common criticism of FRT systems. Dr Daragh Murray, senior lecturer at the School of Law in Queen Mary University of London, sought to highlight the potential “chilling effects”. “Facial recognition represents a step-change in police surveillance capability,” he said, telling the committee he advocated for a moratorium on its use. “Both live and retrospective facial recognition makes possible the ability to monitor, track and profile large amounts of the population with significant private life implications.” FRT has prompted ongoing debate in Ireland, since being introduced by Minister for Justice Helen McEntee, primarily along human rights grounds. It has the ability to sift through thousands of hours of footage at far greater speed than humans. Ms McEntee has backed its application in the investigation of serious crimes such as murder, child sexual abuse and abductions, and has previously said it is not for the purposes of mass surveillance. During two sessions of pre-legislative scrutiny on Tuesday, the committee heard input from 10 witnesses, most flagging some form of reservation. Fianna Fáil Senator Robbie Gallagher said it was “somewhat concerning” the draft Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) (Amendment) Bill had progressed so far given the concerns expressed by various bodies including the Data Protection Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), and Digital Rights Ireland (DRI). Fianna Fáil TD Niamh Smyth similarly said it “would be really important that our Data Protection Commission is truly on-board and feel that this law and legislation is airtight”. The prospect of legal challenges to the Bill, as it is currently drafted, or unsuccessful prosecutions, were raised by the Law Society of Ireland and DRI. The Law Society has pushed for its use to be cleared by a District Court judge, an approach comparable to the granting of search warrants. Prof David Kaye of the Irvine School of Law at the University of California also advocated for strict checks and balances to include prior judicial approval. Dr Nessa Lynch, an expert in biometrics regulation at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand said while various risks had rightly been highlighted, there was a wider human rights framework due consideration. “We do have to reflect on situations where technology such as this can be used in a human rights compliant way where there is a legitimate law enforcement objective,” she said. The extent of proposed FRT use by An Garda Síochána was played down by its chief information officer Andrew O’Sullivan who told the committee it would be retrospective, and with human involvement, rather than autonomous, machine-led results in real time. “We have absolutely no intention of doing real time facial recognition; we also have no time at all for autonomous machine decision making,” he said.  “Every decision [during investigations] will be made by a person.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Two new data protection commissioners appointed Dr Des Hogan will take up his role as a commissioner next week and he will also serve as the organisation’s chairman for three years The Cabinet has signed off on the appointment of two new commissioners for the Data Protection Commission (DPC). Dr Des Hogan will take up his role as a commissioner next week and he will also serve as the organisation’s chairman for three years. An assistant chief solicitor in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor since 2015, he previously held a number of senior positions in the Irish Human Rights Commission. Earlier in his career, he worked for Amnesty International in Australia and the UK. Dale Sutherland joined the DPC in 2016 as a deputy commissioner and played “a central role” in building up its capacity as a global regulator. The current Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon announced her impending departure late last year. She is joining communications regulator ComReg as a commissioner. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee received Government approval for the appointment of the two new commissioners for data protection following a recommendation by the Public Appointments Service (PAS). While Mr Hogan will chair the DPC for three years, the intention is that the position will rotate among commissioners. This follows a Government decision in July 2022 that there be three commissioners. The PAS will shortly commence another competition to recruit a third commissioner. The DPC has seen a massive increase in its workload in recent years as a watchdog for GDPR legislation given that many of the world’s largest social media companies have European headquarters in Dublin. Two-thirds of the fines issued across Europe last year were issued by the DPC on foot of its investigations.",-1,-1_northern_uk_dup_stormont,"['northern', 'uk', 'dup', 'stormont', 'posters', 'north', 'return', 'election', 'new', 'dáil']","['Irish unity in ‘touching distance’ after DUP vote, says McDonald Recall of the Assembly to elect Speaker could take place as early as Saturday Irish unity is within “touching distance” as a nationalist First Minister at Stormont is poised to come into office for the first time, according to Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Reacting to the DUP’s endorsement of a deal with the UK government that will end its two-year boycott of the powersharing Executive, Ms McDonald said the elevation of party vice-president Michelle O’Neill to the head of the North’s devolved government will be a moment of “very great significance”. The recall of the Assembly to elect a Speaker could take place as early as Saturday and DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson signalled on Tuesday his optimism that there are enough concessions to show that the “naysayers are wrong”. The deal is due to be published on Wednesday and Ms O’Neill said the next number of days are crucial to get the powersharing institutions up and running. Addressing media at Stormont, Ms McDonald alluded to previous political arrangements in Northern Ireland, saying: “I think a Sinn Féin First Minister, and Michelle coming into office as First Minister, for all really is the most striking evidence that that era is now gone; it is now consigned to the pages of the history books. “And more importantly it signals now the new Ireland emerging and the conversation around a new constitutional dispensation, ending partition, Irish unity, all of the opportunity that presents is in many ways embodied in this moment of Michelle O’Neill becoming First Minister here.” Ms McDonald added “I think that the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. And I think that’s a very exciting thing.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 when its former first minister Paul Givan quit the executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Donaldson admitted on Tuesday that they had not secured “everything” they had sought from London in relation to changes to the Windsor Framework deal struck between UK and EU last year. However, he said he had achieved a “good outcome for Northern Ireland” and pledged “zero” checks on goods and paperwork works destined for the North - through the “green lane” element of the Windsor Framework – from Britain. “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told reporters outside Stormont. Asked about a timeline for Stormont’s return, he said it was conditional upon the UK government “delivering on their side” but that he hoped it will happen quickly. DUP party discipline remained tight on Tuesday after Monday evening’s DUP executive meeting led to an internal party inquiry when details of Mr Donaldson’s briefing to 130 members were leaked by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Bryson live tweeted details in what he claimed was a “blow by blow account” of the five-hour meeting. Despite Mr Donaldson’s claims on Tuesday that there will be legal changes to the post-Brexit deal, Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris played down the prospect of fresh negotiations with the EU and said that “all conditions are now in place” for a return of the Executive. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was adamant that the Windsor Framework deal will not be changed “one sentence” and that the so-called Irish Sea Border will “still be there”. Mr Beattie expressed concern that the situation could “unravel” in coming days if the Assembly is not restored by Monday. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long told reporters it was a “bittersweet” day in that there was nothing in the DUP deal with the UK that “wasn’t available in 2018 under Theresa May”.', 'UK government publishes deal which will set stage for Stormont return Safeguarding the Union document was released online by the UK government on Wednesday  The text of the legislation which secured the DUP’s return to power-sharing in the North has been published. The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was released online by the UK government on Wednesday afternoon. The measures outlined in the document by the UK government include, as previously signalled, legislation “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the Union” and which amends the UK Internal Market Act 2020 to “guarantee Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the UK’s internal market.” It will also end dynamic alignment with EU law. Legislative change will “recognise the end of the automatic pipeline of EU law”; Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will be amended, “reflecting the new reality that the law which applies in Northern Ireland is now properly subject to the democratic oversight of the Northern Ireland Assembly through the Stormont Brake and the democratic consent mechanism.” The so-called Green Lane will be replaced with a UK internal market system, and the UK government “will commit that more than 80 per cent of all freight movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland take place under the UK internal market system, with independent scrutiny.” This will ensure “there will be no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks.” There will be a legal requirement that new legislation will be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, if so, for ministers to make a statement considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.” The document includes more than 20 provisions, which includes the creation of an Independent Monitoring Panel to “provide oversight of the implementation of new arrangements”, the creation of a UK East-West Council and the publication of operational arrangements for the Stormont Brake. The UK government will also “pursue an agreement with the EU on a long-term basis” to ensure the continued supply of necessary veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland beyond 2025. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said  before it was published that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. His party has been using a veto power to block Stormont’s devolved institutions for almost two years in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, Mr Donaldson announced earlier this week that his party was prepared to return to Stormont, dependent on the UK government implementing the various legislative assurances and other measures it has offered. This is expected to lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland within days and will see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill become the North’s first ever nationalist first minister. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return,” he said on Tuesday. The return of Stormont will also see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland. The financial package includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Mr Donaldson said the deal would represent a “significant change” in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit’s so-called Irish Sea border. He said: “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. “On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.” Sinn Féin has focused on the imminent return of the Stormont Assembly, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald stating that Irish unity is now within “touching distance” as she hailed the significance of her party assuming the role of Stormont first minister for the first time. Ms McDonald said the expected appointment of Ms O’Neill in the coming days would be a moment of “very great significance”. Mr Donaldson announced his support for a Stormont return after receiving the “decisive” backing of the 130-strong party executive during a five-hour meeting on Monday night. He said DUP party officers, a key 12-strong decision-making body, had also “mandated” him to move forward on the basis he was proposing. Support for the deal is not unanimous within the DUP and several senior figures remain opposed to the proposed agreement. - PA', 'Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024. In years to come, much will be made of the significance of this day. It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,False
"Garda chief to warn of ‘unfeasible’ digital workload with 22,000 hours of Dublin riots footage Risks of bringing in facial recognition technology for policing ‘too high’, civil liberties groups to tell politicians Some 22,000 hours of footage from the Dublin riots has come to the attention of the Garda, an Oireachtas committee will hear on Tuesday, as it considers evidence on the merits of introducing facial recognition technology (FRT) for policing. Civil liberties groups will tell politicians that the risks of introducing FRT into Irish policing are “too high” and that it is not a “silver bullet solution”. However,  Garda Commissioner Drew Harris is expected to tell the committee that “manual processing by Garda personnel sitting at screens is becoming unfeasible and ineffective”. Mr Harris says that every major criminal investigation now involves processing digital evidence, often images or footage from seized devices or CCTV. There has been an “explosion in the volume of digital footage as evidence”, he says, giving the example of the November 23rd riots. In the early days of the investigation into the unrest, gardaí said they were looking at 6,000 hours of footage, but TDs and Senators will hear on Tuesday that the footage from the riots runs to 22,000 hours. Individual murder investigations can have “upwards of 50,000 hours of footage” and “seized devices can have over a million images of child sexual abuse”, the Oireachtas Committee on Justice will be told. The committee will hear from several witnesses as it conducts pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft outline of the Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) (Amendment) Bill. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee is seeking to introduce FRT to help in the investigation of serious crimes  such as murder, child sexual abuse and abductions. The technology would speed up Garda trawls through CCTV or other video footage and would apply to retrospective, not live footage. Ms McEntee has previously said its introduction is not for the purposes of mass surveillance. In an opening statement to the committee, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) and Digital Rights Ireland (DRI) say the use of FRT by police “engages many fundamental human rights”, including  rights to human dignity, privacy, protection of personal data and protest. The groups  call on the committee to “urge the Government to reconsider this proposal to introduce FRT into Irish policing, as we believe the risks to these fundamental rights are too high”. They argue that FRT is “unreliable and not the silver bullet solution it’s often presented to be”. They say the technology is “discriminatory” and “studies have clearly demonstrated deeply inherent racial and gender biases”. ICCL and DRI also say FRT “can enable powerful mass, indiscriminate and pervasive surveillance”, and  argue that the Bill as proposed is unlawful under European Union law. The Data Protection Commission’s (DPC) submission to the committee acknowledges the potential of facial recognition technology to benefit the work of  gardaí. However, it adds: “As the use of this technology presents serious risks to the individual’s right to data protection, the legislation must implement the necessary restrictions, limitations and safeguards to ensure that any deployment of facial recognition technology by An Garda Síochána is strictly necessary and proportionate”. It  continues: “Facial recognition technology does not provide definitive results” and there are factors that can “significantly impact the reliability and accuracy of the technology”. The DPC says: “Consequently, it will be necessary for a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to be carried out prior to the introduction of the technology.” For the Garda, Mr Harris says two separate judgments from the Court of Appeal confirm that gardaí “have a duty to process available footage to identify or exclude suspects”. He says that in dismissing the respective appeal cases of convicted murderers Freddie Thompson and Philip Dunbar, “the court’s rulings were instructive in terms of the balance between a suspect’s right to privacy and the human rights of the victim”. Mr Harris says there is “understandable public concern” and “some confusion” about artificial intelligence technology. He will seek to offer reassurance about any Garda use of such technology, saying: “There is no question of autonomous machine decision-making ever”, and “all decisions that can impact on a person are only taken by identifiable and accountable personnel”. He is also expected to defend the reliability of modern biometric identification systems and say: “There must be safeguards, but these should be proportionate to the risks involved in the specific use cases.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"RTÉ controversy: Failure of key figures to face questions is a ‘farce’, committee head says TDs will look at options to compel witnesses for questioning, Niamh Smyth says It is “a farce” that some of the key people involved in Toy Show The Musical were “unavailable” and would not be in the room for today’s committee meeting, the head of the Oireachtas media committee has said. Niamh Smyth was speaking on Newstalk Breakfast and RTÉ Radio 1’s Morning Ireland. She said it was “not sustainable” for former director general of RTÉ Dee Forbes to continue providing “sick notes” when invited to appear before the committee. Ms Forbes, who presided over RTÉ during many of the issues that have arisen in recent months, has on medical advice not accepted invitations to attend media or public accounts committee meetings. Senior figures from RTÉ have been invited back before the committee in the wake of the Grant Thornton report on the loss-making Toy Show the Musical and the separate McCann Fitzgerald report voluntary exit scheme payments at the broadcaster. Members would be looking at the committee’s ability to compel witnesses to attend meetings, as it was no longer “acceptable” that the “key people” were not in the room to explain the reasoning behind the “vanity project”, Ms Smyth said. The Oireachtas media committee had a responsibility to the public and to the staff of RTÉ to ensure there was full accountability of how State funds were spent, she said. On Tuesday RTÉ published an updated version of Grant Thornton’s report on the controversial musical, revealing the names of the majority of the senior figures interviewed, who were anonymised in the original version. RTÉ's former director of strategy Rory Coveney claimed it would have been “unthinkable” to pull the broadcaster’s Toy Show the Musical production in the weeks after it launched, due to poor ticket sales. Today’s media committee will focus on two major issues, she said – the report on Toy Show the Musical and the exit packages given to some executive members of the organisation. Ms Smyth said it appeared that the Toy Show Musical project had been ratified without consensus from within the board of RTÉ. Board members had an obligation to “interrogate” the project and the money being spent on it, he said. The updated version of Grant Thornton’s report on the controversial musical found the board of RTÉ was not formally told about the production until after a contract had already been signed with the Convention Centre Dublin to host the musical, at significant cost. “So I do take the point where board members did feel that there was no going back on this. “I do accept that it was difficult for the members to challenge these concerns they had. But I don’t think it really faces up to the responsibility of the board members who were there,” Ms Smyth said. The Toy Show the Musical production, which ran for several weeks from December 2022, only sold 11,044 tickets despite early internal projections it could reach audiences of more than 100,000 people, resulting in a loss of €2.3 million. Kevin Bakhurst will pledge that “RTÉ will once again become an organisation the country can be proud of” when he appears before the Oireachtas Committee on Media today.

As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Palestinian ambassador thanks Ireland for ‘strong and continued support’ Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns accuses Israel of ‘genocidal intent’, saying ‘there is no greater crime on Earth’ The Palestinian ambassador to Ireland, Dr Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, has thanked the Irish people for “strong and continued” support for the United National Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees (Unrwa). Speaking at the Social Democrats annual conference in Dublin the ambassador referred to Ireland’s additional funding of €20 million in support for Unrwa announced on Thursday. She also thanked Ireland for the Government’s urging of countries that have suspended funding to resume and even expand support to the agency. Dr Wahba Abdalmajid said: “I owe a great gratitude to Ireland and Irish people for the constant and strong support for justice and human rights, and for the just cause of the Palestinian people.” She thanked the State for the “constant support for Unrwa“, saying she knew “many countries in the international community suspended their support for Unrwa”. “Thank you Ireland, thank you to the Irish people, and thank you to the Social Democrats for having me tonight” with you, she said. Unrwa, which provides healthcare, education and other services to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and across the Middle East, is currently under investigation following allegations by Israel that 12 of its staff were involved in the October 7th Hamas-led attack on Israel which sparked the bombardment of Gaza. Dr Wahba Abdalmajid said Palestine was facing ethnic cleansing and genocide. “We are a just cause, and our Palestine people deserve to live.” She said the October 7th attacks on Israelis did not happen out of nowhere. “It was due to the continuing occupation of Palestine and the continuing policies of persecution and oppression. This has been our narrative for more than 75 years.” Earlier Social Democrat leader Holly Cairns said the “absolute disregard” Israel showed for Palestinian lives “is appalling”. “Senior Israeli government officials, including the prime minister, the president, the minister for defence, have clearly expressed genocidal intent. It is on us in every country to act when we hear that. There is no greater crime on Earth.” Unrwa, which provides healthcare, education and other services to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and across the Middle East, is currently under investigation following allegations by Israel that 12 of its staff were involved in the October 7th Hamas-led attack on Israel which sparked the bombardment of Gaza.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.5514430101684511,False
"Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns calls for  details of all exit packages for RTÉ executives  National  conference will hear from Palestinian ambassador, but Israeli ambassador has not been invited Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns has called for the publication of details surrounding all exit packages for executives at RTÉ, saying there is a need for “full transparency” at the broadcaster. RTÉ has sought fresh legal advice regarding what it can say around severance packages at the broadcaster after it confirmed it paid €450,000 to its former chief financial officer as part of a severance scheme. The disclosure has led to calls from the political system for more details to be published on its severance packages, including one paid to former director of strategy Rory Coveney, who resigned from the broadcaster last year. Asked if she would call for full disclosure of what was involved in the severance packages, Ms Cairns, who is this weekend steering her first national conference as Social Democrats leader, said: “Absolutely, we need complete transparency in relation to this. “When we zoom out and look at this it’s key that RTÉ rebuild trust with the public that they can instil confidence in the public with the work that they do, and I don’t think that can be achieved without complete accountability and transparency,” she told reporters at the opening night of the conference. Ms Cairns said that the conference would focus on disability, climate and housing, as well as hearing from the Palestinian ambassador. Asked if the Israeli ambassador – who the party wants ejected from Ireland – had been invited, Ms Cairns confirmed she had not been. “Our focus in this moment at this time was to invite the Palestinian ambassador here,” she said. “The Irish people have sent a clear message that they want Ireland to be strong on this issue, and that’s why we’ve prioritised the attendance of the Palestinian ambassador at this particular conference.” Ms Cairns said her ambition was to “offer as many people as possible the option to vote for the Social Democrats”. “We’re trying to put social democracy on as many ballot papers as we can around the country, and we’re asking people to give us a chance. We promise to work hard and do our best to try and keep people’s trust, and we really want to be a part of a progressive change in Ireland.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.5863396584681477,False
"Thousands more children to become eligible for free school transport Minister for Education Norma Foley is working on expansion of scheme which will see students who live closer to schools become eligible for bus tickets Thousands more children will become eligible for free school transport under plans being finalised by the Government. The Irish Times has learned that Minister for Education Norma Foley is working on an expansion of the scheme which would see students’ families who live closer to schools become eligible for the tickets. Under current thresholds primary school students who live more than 3.2km from their closest primary school and 4.8km for secondary schools are eligible for the tickets. It is understood Ms Foley has told Cabinet colleagues that, following a review of the scheme, the intention is now to lower those limits. This means many more children will become eligible for the ticket. Sources would not be drawn on exactly when the mooted changes will come into effect, but the review encompasses the operation of the scheme out to 2030, suggesting it is unlikely to kick in immediately. The families of 161,600 children benefit from the free transport scheme, but the plans outlined by the Kerry TD to a Cabinet subcommittee on education held on Thursday evening would see many more become eligible. Currently those children who live within existing limits are not eligible for the scheme and have to apply for a concessionary ticket allocated on a basis of availability for a bus seat once all eligible children have been catered for. The scheme cost €382 million in 2023, according to a recent response to a parliamentary question. In response to queries, a spokesman for Ms Foley said that the review of the scheme has recently been completed. “The final report includes recommendations on the operation and strategic development of the scheme. It is expected that the review will be brought to Government shortly and further to Government approval, the review will be published.” The Irish Times last month reported that a review of the scheme found that while it is operating at a “considerable cost” it plays a key role in reducing climate emissions, supporting parents to work and providing access for children to school. The review was triggered in recent years following concern within the Department of Public Expenditure over “unsustainable” costs as well as annual controversy over the volume of children who lose out on bus places. Internal Department of Education records state that the review has been completed, and that it makes the case that the scheme supports wider Government policies in areas such as climate action, rural connectivity, tackling rural deprivation, supporting the labour market and working parents and fostering life skills for children. “While operating at significant cost to the exchequer the school transport scheme has demonstrable wider economic benefits and offers a vital public service without which many families would struggle to find alternative modes of transport to and from school,” one record released to The Irish Times states.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.6351103234707345,False

Ms Doherty was formerly a TD for Meath and a cabinet minister in the Fine Gael-Independent government and is currently the Fine Gael leader in the Seanad. She will aim to retain the seat held by Frances Fitzgerald, who is retiring at the next election. “Fine Gael is a pro-European party with a proud record,” said Ms Doherty, adding she wished to ensure Dublin’s voice was “heard loudly” in the European Parliament. Elsewhere, the Labour Party selected Prof Niamh Hourigan, an academic from the University of Limerick, as its candidate in the South constituency. “I will bring three priorities to Europe: to fight for a just transition to a greener economy; introducing a European plan for affordable housing; and protecting Irish neutrality,” said the sociologist who is the sister of Green TD Neasa Hourigan. Sinn Féin selected Chris MacManus and Michelle Gildernew, a Westminster MP, to contest the Midlands-North West constituency. Party president Mary Lou McDonald said voters could be certain the pair “will fight your corner and stand up for you in the European Parliament.

Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances?

Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.42547406103529256,False
"Holly Cairns says Social Democrats in power would deliver 50,000 homes a year Party leader says she will ‘talk to every party’ about a potential coalition after next election preferably excluding Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns has said her party would deliver 50,000 homes a year within two years of helping to form the next government. Ms Cairns outlined the target to delegates at her party conference on Saturday evening and on Sunday told RTÉ she expected a new government to hit it “about two years in” to its term of office. “Now… we could in government deliver 10,000 affordable homes and 12,000 social homes. At the moment what we’re seeing is about 10,000 social homes and about 1,000 affordable homes. We think we could ramp up to that quite quickly, and by the end of a term, you’d want to be getting to the 50,000, or sooner than that, I would say, about two years in,” she told RTÉ Radio 1′s This Week. “Ultimately, the Construction Federation of Ireland have said that we’ve capacity to build about 60,000 homes per year, but I think in an environment where broken promises, and overpromising and underdelivering is so apparent, it’s important to make sure we make promises that we can keep, and we think that is necessary and deliverable.” Ms Cairns said she will “talk to every party” about a potential coalition government after the next election, though she indicated her preference would be a government without either Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. Ms Cairns told RTÉ’s that “some conversations would be longer than others”. She was speaking in the wake of her party’s annual conference, at which she said “a year of election” gave voters the chance to achieve “change” that would be “seismic”. Ms Cairns, who became leader of the party unopposed just under a year ago, told delegates attending her first conference as leader in UCD that there was an air of disillusionment in the country because of the Government’s failure to provide basic services to people. But, she said, “the tide is turning in Irish politics. I can feel it. I think we all can”. In a speech that dealt with a range of subjects including healthcare, disability services, housing, immigration and the situation in Gaza, Ms Cairns appealed to voters to hear her message of change. “We won’t engage in auction politics – and promise the sun, moon and stars,” she told delegates at UCD’s O’Reilly Hall. But we will be honest. We will work hard. And we are determined to never lose your trust. Now is the time to effect real and lasting change. We need to seize this opportunity,” Ms Cairns said. One of the few concrete promises the Social Democrats leader made in the course of her televised leader’s address was that the “full, accelerated implementation of Sláintecare” would be a “red line issue for the Social Democrats in any programme for government”. Ms Cairns also confronted the idea that “Ireland is full”, increasingly a message pushed by anti-immigration campaigners. “You have probably heard those voices shout that Ireland is full – that all of the problems we face in housing and health are the cause of a small number of vulnerable migrants,” she said. “I want to assure you that this is completely and utterly untrue. Ireland is not full, it’s just not working properly. And that can be fixed,” she said to applause. In a speech that criticised the Government’s performance, especially on housing and disability services, Ms Cairns also singled out what she said was its inaction on the conflict in Gaza, describing it as “genocide”. “We must stand with the Palestinian people today, tomorrow and always,” she said. “Because in the face of genocide, inaction becomes complicity.” Ms Cairns sought to encourage new Social Democrats candidates, many of whom were present, by recalling that she won her first election – just five years ago – “by a single vote”. The televised speech was received enthusiastically  by about 250 delegates, who gave Ms Cairns a mid-speech standing ovation for her comments demanding action from the Government on Gaza. Ms Cairns, a first time TD for Cork South-West, said she had never taken her own re-election “for granted”. “I try to work as hard as I possibly can, and hope that people feel like it was worthwhile taking that leap of faith [in me] and I continue to work to try to keep people’s trust,” she said. Former co-leaders Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall both said at present they intended to run again in the next general election. “I could get knocked over by a bus, as of today that’s the plan [standing for re-election], and I’ll be trying to make sure I don’t get knocked over by a bus,” Ms Murphy said.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air.

"RTÉ crisis ‘worsening’ over exit package revelations, chair of Oireachtas Media Committee says Fianna Fáil’s Niamh Smyth says broadcaster should not have agreed to confidentiality clauses The Chair of the Oireachtas Media Committee Niamh Smyth has said she is “deeply concerned” about recent revelations regarding exit packages at RTÉ. Ms Smyth also said there needs to be “honesty and transparency” at a meeting requested by Minister for Media Catherine Martin with RTÉ Director General Kevin Bakhurst and Chair of the Board Siún Ní Raghallaigh on Monday. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, the Fianna Fáil TD said for the minister to summon Mr Bakhurst and Ms Ní Raghallaigh signals “the crisis is worsening”. RTÉ is facing strong political pressure to reveal the details of exit packages paid to senior executives who have left the station in recent years. It was reported over the weekend that the former director of strategy Rory Coveney, who oversaw the failed Toy Show the Musical project that lost €2.3 million, was paid about €200,000 when he left the station last year. In a statement, RTÉ said that the former chief financial officer Richard Collins left the station last year after “independent mediation”. It said that the agreement included a “binding confidentiality clause that was agreed to by both sides and in the interest of fairness and respect cannot be breached”. Ms Smyth said the approval of a confidentiality clause by RTÉ didn’t “bode well to this idea that we are going to be given full transparency”. The Cavan-Monaghan TD questioned why Mr Collins’ package should be confidential and added that she would like to see the legal advice received around it. She said she couldn’t see how such a clause was allowed or acceptable to the board. “None of that speaks to what we were promised, which was openness, transparency, and I’m not sure it plays to good governance either,” she said. Ms Smyth said she wanted “full transparency” around all exit packages, which was “an obvious requirement from the DG and from the board”. She also said it was important the Director General and the chair “come clean” with the minister and the Oireachtas Media Committee. “It appears we’re not out of the woods with these issues yet,” she said.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Little prospect of RTÉ exit package details becoming public, Bakhurst says Director general in a ‘quite unusual’ position with some politicians effectively asking him to break law and reveal confidential information RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst has accepted there is little prospect of the details of exit packages paid to senior executives who have left the broadcaster over the past two years being revealed. Minister for Media Catherine Martin asked Mr Bakhurst during a two-hour meeting on Monday to explore every possible avenue to bring clarity on how much taxpayers’ money was paid to former senior managers in RTÉ, including former head of strategy Rory Coveney and ex-director of finance Richard Collins. Both have left the organisation since he became director general last year, with their exit deals involving undisclosed payments. Ms Martin said on Monday approaching the individuals involved to ask if they would agree to waive the confidentiality clauses that formed part of their agreements was an option. It was reported over the weekend that Mr Coveney, who oversaw the failed Toy Show the Musical project, which lost some €2.3 million, was paid about €200,000 when he left RTÉ last year. Mr Bakhurst would not be drawn on the accuracy of that figure, but he confirmed that Mr Coveney’s exit package was far less than what it might have been if he had, for example, pursued a case at the Workplace Relations Commission. In an interview on RTÉ radio‘s Drivetime programme, Mr Bakhurst insisted the law was very clear on the non-disclosure elements of such agreements. He also suggested that some elected politicians, but not Ms Martin, were effectively asking him to break the law, which put him in a “quite unusual” position. He said RTÉ was taking legal advice on bringing more clarity to the agreements but also said confidentiality was standard in mediated situations. “I had a discussion with the Minister about pursuing every avenue possible, which is what I said would do on achieving maximum transparency. And the Minister is very well aware of Ireland’s employment laws, and the legal constraints.” Mr Bakhurst argued that he had wanted to refresh the RTÉ management team and there were no grounds for firing Mr Coveney or Mr Collins, which meant exit packages had to be negotiated in both cases. “I think the underlying thing is when you work in the semi-State [sector] like we do in RTÉ, we’re not in America, you can’t just fire people willy-nilly with no repercussions,” he said. “Had I gone down that route, it would have resulted in a liability substantially more than what we ended up paying because we’d have legal cases taken against us.” Earlier, Mr Bakhurst took issue with the suggestion that the deals were secret. He said he had disclosed in an interview last July that Mr Coveney had received a payment. However, he rowed back on that during the interview, accepting he had said at the time that Mr Coveney had not received a payment “going out the door” but was entitled to a statutory payment, which would have been a fraction of the sum he is reported to have received. He accepted that Toy Show the Musical was a “disaster” but said Mr Coveney had a 16-year career at the station and had presided over really successful initiatives during that time. He also argued that there was a zero net cost to the broadcaster as the position had not been filled. After her meeting with Mr Bakhurst and RTÉ chairwoman Siún Ní Raghallaigh on Monday, Ms Martin said she had expressed “concern and frustration” at how the ongoing controversy was undermining the reform programme at the broadcaster. Ms Martin said she fully supported a cap being put on exit payments in future. It emerged last week that former RTÉ chief financial officer Breda O’Keeffe was given a redundancy payout of €450,000. “We should not see the eye-watering, shocking amounts that we saw last week ever again,” the Minister said. She expressed confidence in Mr Bakhurst notwithstanding the current controversy, saying: “I think he is the best person to be the DG of RTÉ.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances?

As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,True

Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked?

Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh had threatened to quit and resisted meeting before Catherine Martin Prime Time interview Oireachtas media committee will now extend invitation to Ní Raghallaigh to appear before it Siún Ní Raghallaigh warned she could resign before a crucial appearance by Minister for Media Catherine Martin on RTÉ Prime Time last week, according to the Minister, and resisted attempts to arrange a meeting to discuss Ms Martin’s disappointment in her. During a meeting of the Oireachtas media committee, Ms Martin revealed a day of frantic exchanges between her officials and former RTÉ chair Ms Ní Raghallaigh in the run-in to the Minister’s appearance on Prime Time last Thursday evening, after which the chair resigned. Following an appearance that shed light on a dramatic breakdown in relations last week, the committee has now decided to extend an invitation to the former chair of RTÉ to appear before it, as the fallout over Ms Ní Raghallaigh’s resignation continues to rock the Government and the broadcaster. Ms Martin outlined on Tuesday evening repeated instances of Ms Ní Raghallaigh giving her inaccurate information about the board’s involvement in signing off on an exit package for the former chief financial officer Richard Collins, as well as having apologised for previously failing to tell the Minister she had sought the resignation of former RTÉ director general Dee Forbes. She told the committee that she needed to rely on accurate information from the chair, and outlined that having been told last Thursday of her intention to write to Ms Ní Raghallaigh and express her disappointment about being given inaccurate information during the week, the former RTÉ chair “expressed her unhappiness” about the prospect of receiving the letter. “The former chair was not willing to receive a letter,” she said, referencing a discussion with officials. “It’s quite problematic from a confidence point of view if the chair is not willing to receive a letter.” She told Ms Martin’s officials that this would reflect a lack of confidence and she would have to consider her position as chair, Ms Martin said. Later in the afternoon, Ms Martin said that Ms Ní Raghallaigh told her officials that she was “not happy” about the prospect of being called to another meeting on the following morning, as had been suggested. Ms Martin, who said she did not believe the former chair acted intentionally in misinforming her, proceeded with the Prime Time interview, and insisted at the committee that she had no option but to go ahead with it. She said that before going on air, she believed a story about the day’s events was about to break, and that her advisers had told RTÉ that she would be willing to discuss it on air. Ms Martin said she was trying to avoid expressing no confidence in the RTÉ chair on air and that she hoped the meeting  that she had invited Ms Ní Raghallaigh to on Friday morning would proceed, and that she hoped Ms Ní Raghallaigh’s talk of resigning would prove to be “just a rash comment”. “I was remaining hopeful that was just something that was said in the heat of the moment,” Ms Martin told the committee. The Minister for Media said that she hoped to appoint a full-time replacement RTÉ chair within the week and that there are active consultations  about the appointment. The former Director General of the Department of Arts and Media, Katherine Licken, is also to be invited before the committee. Ms Licken received a phone call in October from Ms Ní Raghallaigh which the RTÉ board has said communicated the board sign-off for the deal. Ms Martin in effect disputed this on Tuesday, saying that the former RTÉ chair last week told officials she “imagined” she would have outlined the board’s involvement",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”.

In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.9080210952400702,True
"Dee Forbes given chance to submit written account of her role in RTÉ scandals Former director general has been unable to attend previous Oireachtas committee hearings due to ill health Former RTÉ director general Dee Forbes is set to be given a chance by an Oireachtas committee to submit a written account of her role in the payments scandal that has enveloped the broadcaster. Ms Forbes, who was one of the first executives to depart the station last summer as news of undisclosed payments to star broadcaster Ryan Tubridy approved by her rocked RTÉ, has been unable to attend any committee hearings due to ill health. But now the Oireachtas media committee is set to make another attempt to elicit Ms Forbes’ side of the story, which would break the silence from one of the central figures in the RTÉ saga. Director of content Jim Jennings, who has also been unable to attend any committee sessions because of health issues, is due to be given the same chance. Both will be invited to appear either in person or remotely, but committee chair Niamh Smyth said that they will also be told they can submit written responses to questions currently being drafted by the committee. “We have taken legal advice at the committee in terms of those who are unwell and unfit to present at committee and we have the opportunity of writing to people such as Dee Forbes and Jim Jennings who haven’t been able to present,” committee chair Niamh Smyth said on Wednesday. She said that members will want to ask “very particular questions trying to elicit very specific answers”, and that due time would be given to preparing questions for the two executives. Malcolm Byrne, Fianna Fáil senator and a member of the media committee, said: “The committee is to consider seeking written submissions from those who haven’t been in a position to attend, including Dee Forbes.” “I appreciate illness may preclude a response but for us to fully complete the jigsaw as to what happened in RTÉ, we need to see the missing pieces,” he said. The committee is also expected to seek full documentation including notes of meetings between politicians, civil servants and former RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh, whose resignation last week added another layer of controversy to the ongoing saga. Minister for Media Catherine Martin indicated to the media committee on Tuesday that she would be open to sharing all documents as part of a transparency effort. Ms Martin is also to meet with the board of RTÉ, which is said to be furious about the manner of Ms Ní Raghallaigh’s resignation, later this week – likely on Friday. On Wednesday, Ms Martin told the Dáil that public trust in RTÉ needs to be restored before a new funding model for public service broadcasting can be considered by the Government. She said that the Government was committed to reforming the current funding system during its term in office and she was “more determined than ever to see this happen”. On Tuesday, Ms Martin told the Oireachtas media committee that Ms Ní Raghallaigh warned she could resign before a crucial appearance by the Minister on RTÉ Prime Time last week, and resisted attempts to arrange a meeting to discuss Ms Martin’s disappointment in her. Asked on Wednesday about Ms Martin’s remarks in the Dáil and the media committee, a spokeswoman for Ms Ní Raghallaigh said “she has nothing to say at this time”.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night.

"Catherine Martin’s media committee appearance shows confidence in RTÉ chair was lost before Prime Time interview Martin’s net point was that the accumulation of incorrect information from the former chairwoman shook her confidence Almost one week after Catherine Martin’s fateful Prime Time interview prompted Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s abrupt exit from RTÉ, the Minister for Media is not changing her tune. At the Oireachtas Media Committee last night Martin reiterated how she came to have “considerable cause for concern” because of the lack of “accurate and timely information” from RTÉ's chairwoman about the role of the board remuneration committee in the October exit payment for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. “Regrettably, this was not the first time that the then chair had failed to give me a clear account of her and the board’s work at RTÉ,” she said. That was a reference to Ní Raghallaigh’s failure to tell Martin she sought the resignation of former RTÉ director general Dee Forbes in June at the very outset of scandal. But the Minister told the committee how Ní Raghallaigh also failed to say the July departure of former director of strategy Rory Coveney was something other than the straightforward resignation that RTÉ described at the time. That was all too salient because Coveney received a reported €200,000 payout despite his prime role in the Toy Show, the Musical debacle. Martin’s net point was that the accumulation of incorrect information from the former chairwoman shook her confidence. The decisive moment was reached last Thursday when Ní Raghallaigh made contact with the Minister’s department to say she inadvertently failed to say at meetings on Monday and Wednesday that the Collins deal did indeed go through the RTÉ board via the board remuneration committee. That was the catalyst for Martin’s Prime Time intervention. The Minister said she didn’t expect to be asked whether she had confidence in Ní Raghallaigh, but it still seemed an obvious question in the circumstances. She insisted she was determined not to say she had no confidence but that was academic. The chairwoman had no choice once the Minister declined to say she had confidence. New information emerged about the sequence of events leading up to the TV interview. The Minister said she told Ní Raghallaigh on Thursday that she was minded to write a formal letter setting out her concerns. The chairwoman’s response was to argue against that course, arguing she was not willing to receive such a letter and might resign if the Minister sent it. It follows that Martin must have known the chairwoman was on the precipice when she went on live television. All of that suggests the point of no return had already been reached in terms of the Minister’s confidence in the RTÉ chairwoman. True enough, Ní Raghallaigh’s tenure is now in the rear view mirror with all the other “former” RTÉ figures of the debacle: Forbes, Collins, Coveney, Ryan Tubridy, the previous chairwoman Moya Doherty and assorted others who have featured in the saga. But the extent to which Martin made so much of the breakdown of trust with Ní Raghallaigh now raises questions for her engagements with the remaining independent members of the RTÉ board and director general Kevin Bakhurst. Recall that the RTÉ board and Bakhurt’s management team have backed Ní Raghallaigh to the hilt. In two separate statements on Friday the independent directors and remuneration committee endorsed the former chairwoman’s account that she told Martin’s department in October of the committee’s involvement in the Collins deal. In an earlier Friday statement RTÉ said the chairwoman had told the department and that the information was “taken as read” but “seems now that it shoudn’t have been”. That is rejected on the Minister’s side. Martin told the committee that Ní Raghallaigh at one point last week said she “imagined” she would have disclosed the committee’s role in a phone call with the then department secretary general Katherine Licken, since retired and not at the committee last night because she is no longer in post and is now a private citizen.

Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024. In years to come, much will be made of the significance of this day. It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.",-1,-1_northern_uk_dup_stormont,"['northern', 'uk', 'dup', 'stormont', 'posters', 'north', 'return', 'election', 'new', 'dáil']","['Irish unity in ‘touching distance’ after DUP vote, says McDonald Recall of the Assembly to elect Speaker could take place as early as Saturday Irish unity is within “touching distance” as a nationalist First Minister at Stormont is poised to come into office for the first time, according to Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Reacting to the DUP’s endorsement of a deal with the UK government that will end its two-year boycott of the powersharing Executive, Ms McDonald said the elevation of party vice-president Michelle O’Neill to the head of the North’s devolved government will be a moment of “very great significance”. The recall of the Assembly to elect a Speaker could take place as early as Saturday and DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson signalled on Tuesday his optimism that there are enough concessions to show that the “naysayers are wrong”. The deal is due to be published on Wednesday and Ms O’Neill said the next number of days are crucial to get the powersharing institutions up and running. Addressing media at Stormont, Ms McDonald alluded to previous political arrangements in Northern Ireland, saying: “I think a Sinn Féin First Minister, and Michelle coming into office as First Minister, for all really is the most striking evidence that that era is now gone; it is now consigned to the pages of the history books. “And more importantly it signals now the new Ireland emerging and the conversation around a new constitutional dispensation, ending partition, Irish unity, all of the opportunity that presents is in many ways embodied in this moment of Michelle O’Neill becoming First Minister here.” Ms McDonald added “I think that the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. And I think that’s a very exciting thing.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 when its former first minister Paul Givan quit the executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Donaldson admitted on Tuesday that they had not secured “everything” they had sought from London in relation to changes to the Windsor Framework deal struck between UK and EU last year. However, he said he had achieved a “good outcome for Northern Ireland” and pledged “zero” checks on goods and paperwork works destined for the North - through the “green lane” element of the Windsor Framework – from Britain. “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told reporters outside Stormont. Asked about a timeline for Stormont’s return, he said it was conditional upon the UK government “delivering on their side” but that he hoped it will happen quickly. DUP party discipline remained tight on Tuesday after Monday evening’s DUP executive meeting led to an internal party inquiry when details of Mr Donaldson’s briefing to 130 members were leaked by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Bryson live tweeted details in what he claimed was a “blow by blow account” of the five-hour meeting. Despite Mr Donaldson’s claims on Tuesday that there will be legal changes to the post-Brexit deal, Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris played down the prospect of fresh negotiations with the EU and said that “all conditions are now in place” for a return of the Executive. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was adamant that the Windsor Framework deal will not be changed “one sentence” and that the so-called Irish Sea Border will “still be there”. Mr Beattie expressed concern that the situation could “unravel” in coming days if the Assembly is not restored by Monday. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long told reporters it was a “bittersweet” day in that there was nothing in the DUP deal with the UK that “wasn’t available in 2018 under Theresa May”.', 'UK government publishes deal which will set stage for Stormont return Safeguarding the Union document was released online by the UK government on Wednesday  The text of the legislation which secured the DUP’s return to power-sharing in the North has been published. The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was released online by the UK government on Wednesday afternoon. The measures outlined in the document by the UK government include, as previously signalled, legislation “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the Union” and which amends the UK Internal Market Act 2020 to “guarantee Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the UK’s internal market.” It will also end dynamic alignment with EU law. Legislative change will “recognise the end of the automatic pipeline of EU law”; Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will be amended, “reflecting the new reality that the law which applies in Northern Ireland is now properly subject to the democratic oversight of the Northern Ireland Assembly through the Stormont Brake and the democratic consent mechanism.” The so-called Green Lane will be replaced with a UK internal market system, and the UK government “will commit that more than 80 per cent of all freight movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland take place under the UK internal market system, with independent scrutiny.” This will ensure “there will be no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks.” There will be a legal requirement that new legislation will be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, if so, for ministers to make a statement considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.” The document includes more than 20 provisions, which includes the creation of an Independent Monitoring Panel to “provide oversight of the implementation of new arrangements”, the creation of a UK East-West Council and the publication of operational arrangements for the Stormont Brake. The UK government will also “pursue an agreement with the EU on a long-term basis” to ensure the continued supply of necessary veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland beyond 2025. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said  before it was published that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. His party has been using a veto power to block Stormont’s devolved institutions for almost two years in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, Mr Donaldson announced earlier this week that his party was prepared to return to Stormont, dependent on the UK government implementing the various legislative assurances and other measures it has offered. This is expected to lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland within days and will see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill become the North’s first ever nationalist first minister. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return,” he said on Tuesday. The return of Stormont will also see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland. The financial package includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Mr Donaldson said the deal would represent a “significant change” in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit’s so-called Irish Sea border. He said: “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. “On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.” Sinn Féin has focused on the imminent return of the Stormont Assembly, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald stating that Irish unity is now within “touching distance” as she hailed the significance of her party assuming the role of Stormont first minister for the first time. Ms McDonald said the expected appointment of Ms O’Neill in the coming days would be a moment of “very great significance”. Mr Donaldson announced his support for a Stormont return after receiving the “decisive” backing of the 130-strong party executive during a five-hour meeting on Monday night. He said DUP party officers, a key 12-strong decision-making body, had also “mandated” him to move forward on the basis he was proposing. Support for the deal is not unanimous within the DUP and several senior figures remain opposed to the proposed agreement. - PA', 'Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024.

The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,True
"First Minister Michelle O’Neill makes the most of her moment as Stormont Assembly recalled after two-year impasse Sense of occasion felt throughout the Assembly Chamber as Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly acknowledged ‘historic moment’, with one lone dissenting TUV voice It was her moment, and she made the most of it. It only took 20 seconds for Michelle O’Neill to make her way from the top of the staircase down to the Great Hall at Parliament Buildings and into the Assembly Chamber for Saturday’s recall, but she smiled every step of the way. Everyone else was already in the chamber; last to arrive were her fellow Sinn Féin MLAs, who swept in on the dot of 1pm. As O’Neill appeared, applause broke out among those watching on the balconies and in the hall itself; she gave a little wave of acknowledgment, a “good afternoon” to the waiting media and then, still with that broad smile on her face, she went to take her seat. As she walked, she surely must have reflected on the significance of this moment and on all that had brought her and her party to this point. Michelle O’Neill (47) from a republican family in Clonoe, Co Tyrone, who was prayed over in school when she became pregnant as a teenager, on Saturday became the first nationalist to hold the position of Northern Ireland’s First Minister. As she said later in her speech, “that such a day would ever come would have been unimaginable to my parents and grandparents’ generation”. Certainly, others felt that sense of occasion. In his congratulations the SDLP’s Matthew O’Toole, now the leader of the official Opposition, pointed out that the state created just over 100 years ago was never meant to have people like Michelle O’Neill in charge. Even her new counterpart as Deputy First Minister, the DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly, acknowledged that “for many today, it is a historic moment”, though adding with it a reminder that they now shared a joint office “as first ministers”. It was certainly a day of change. In her speech, O’Neill noted how her appointment “reflects the change that is happening” and in carefully-phrased language emphasised her determination to reach out to those of all backgrounds and be, as has been her catchphrase, a “First Minister for all”. This was not the time or the place for mention of a united Ireland, for all Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald’s remark earlier this week that it was now “within touching distance.” Instead, O’Neill acknowledged different “aspirations”, and how they might make a “shared future.” Addressing the chamber for the first time as First Minister, she said: “This place we call home, this place we love, North of Ireland or Northern Ireland, where you can be British, Irish, both or none, is a changing portrait. “To all of you who are British and unionist: your national identity, culture and traditions are important to me. “I will be both inclusive and respectful to you,” she pledged. “Our allegiances are equally legitimate. Let’s walk this two-way street and meet one another halfway. I will be doing so with both an open hand and with heart,” she said, putting her own hand to her heart; for the briefest of moments, emotion flooded her voice, and her composure almost broke. Little-Pengelly spoke with emotion too, recalling how as an 11-year-old “I stepped outside my Markethill home on a warm August afternoon to the absolute devastation from an IRA bomb ... the haunting wail of alarms and our emergency services, the carpet of glass and debris, the shock, the crying, the panic”. This from the new Deputy First Minister was both an implicit attack on the party seated on the benches opposite, and a message of reassurance to the unionist grassroots. She continued: “The past, with all its horror, can never be forgotten or nor will it be allowed to be rewritten. But while we are shaped by the past, we are not defined by it.” Just as O’Neill acknowledged these were changed times, so too did Little-Pengelly; from the DUP’s point of view, this was a change shaped above all by pragmatism, by the knowledge that it had taken its protest as far as it could; its boycott was now over, and it was time to get on with the business of sharing power again with Sinn Féin. Throughout, the constant thorn in the side was the lone voice of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, who took to his feet again and again to denounce the DUP “sell-out” and indeed the “day of glee and gloating for republicanism”. The multiple DUP voices who responded were on the same, combative page that party leader Jeffrey Donaldson has been on all week as he sold his deal. Paul Givan, now the Minister for Education, called Allister “an angry man” while Minister for Communities Gordon Lyons’s rejoinder was that every time Allister speaks, it is a reminder why he is “the sole TUV representative on these benches”. With O’Neill and Little-Pengelly in place – and the DUP’s Edwin Poots presiding as speaker – it was time for the last big bit of business of the day: the selection of ministers according to the D’Hondt process. Sinn Féin had the first pick, and installed Conor Murphy in the Economy brief; here, the DUP threw a spanner in the works, choosing Education for Paul Givan rather than, as had widely been understood, placing Gordon Lyons in Finance. This was clearly a shock to Sinn Féin, which immediately requested a brief suspension, presumably to work out which portfolio it should take next – Finance, as it turned out, which went to Caoimhe Archibald. This surprise move by the DUP was an indication that, for all the best behaviour on display on this first day back at school, sharing power will prove a much more challenging prospect when the parties get down to day-to-day decision-making. For all the history of the day, ultimately the success or otherwise of this reconstituted Assembly and Executive will be judged by the people of Northern Ireland on whether it addresses problems such as spiralling waiting lists and public sector pay and, indeed, the stability of the institutions themselves so that now that the Assembly and Executive are back up and running, they stay up and running. Among those keeping a close eye on proceedings in the Great Hall on Saturday was Stuart Anderson, head of public affairs at the NI Chamber and a man with a long wishlist. “From a business point of view, we need a stabilisation of public services, so the first thing we want to see is the public sector pay dispute settled so that public services are returned, but then we need to see a programme for government,” he said. While the restoration of the Assembly is “a good start”, it is only the start, said Anderson. “I was asked the question, do you think this will last, and I think it’s the wrong question. I think it’s how do we make it last? And I think we all have a role to play in that.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.42547406103529256,False
"Mary Lou McDonald expects vote on Irish unity ‘this decade’ Ms McDonald’s comments echo earlier remarks from Michelle O’Neill, who said we are entering a ‘decade of opportunity’ A referendum on Irish unity can be expected “in this decade” and the Government needs to “clear the democratic space” to allow a national “conversation” on unification, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald has said. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s This Week programme on Sunday she said the issue was “live”, the “conversation” was “under way” and the opportunities that reunification would bring were “immense”. Her comments echo similar remarks made by new First Minister Michelle O’Neill in an interview with Sky News on Sunday morning. The Sinn Féin vice-president became the first nationalist to assume the post of First Minister during a historic sitting of the Stormont Assembly on Saturday, which has returned following two years of political deadlock. Ms O’Neill also said she expects a vote on Irish unity to take place in the next decade, describing it as a “decade of opportunity”. Ms McDonald said the restoration of powersharing in Stormont was a “matter of great relief”, because “the bread and butter, the day-to-day issues have to be tackled”. She continued: “I sensed yesterday ... a great sense of purpose by everyone who showed up to make all of this work.” The appointment of Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O’Neill as Northern Ireland First Minister was “hugely, historically significant” particularly as “the Northern state was specifically engineered to ensure someone like Michelle O’Neill would never, ever darken the office of First Minister ... such is the level of change and progress that has come to past. “For me, it is a matter of great joy for nationalists and republicans for people who grew up in a very, very discriminatory environment .. For society more generally it’s a statement of equality that no office, including the highest office in the land, is beyond the reach of anyone. I think that’s wonderful. “As to the Irish unity question, the conversation is now under way ... This question is live ... preparation for Constitutional transition and change needs to be under way and it needs to be led by the Government in Dublin.” There would be “no singular event” that would bring Irish unity, bar a referendum as provided for in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Asked when she envisaged a referendum, she said: “In this decade ... This is a decade of opportunity. I think the opportunities afforded to this island in reunification are immense. They could not be overstated. “But we are going to have to manage the process. I think responsible leadership, responsible political leadership would be at that now. I think the [Irish] Government’s Shared Island unit is a useful device ... but it’s not enough. We now need active planning and the Government in Dublin needs to clear the democratic space for this inclusive conversation to happen. I think people will be amazed and surprised by the level of common cause and common ground that exists.” Ms McDonald said it should not surprise anyone that the Democratic Unionist Party has emphasised the strength of the union with Great Britain this weekend. “The provisions for the union or the ending of the union are contained in the Good Friday Agreement and the 1998 Act, and that is in not changed by any deal between DUP and the British Government. That remains the rule book and what it means, and this is probably the great genius of Good Friday Agreement, is that on the one hand we work together constructively and energetically to face the here-and-now issues in our economy, the health service, in housing. “But equally those of an Irish unity perspective and those of a unionist perspective can articulate, advocate and work for those positions. But the rule book is and remains the Good Friday Agreement in which this question will be adjudicated by means of referendums and a simple majority of 50 per cent plus one either maintains the union or brings that situation to an end.” The issues of the tricolour and the Irish national anthem, she continued, were not top of unionists’ agenda when Irish unity was raised, she said. “The single biggest issue that unionists in particular raise with me is not about flags and emblems or identity, important as they are, it’s actually around the health services. That’s the single, consistently big issue. And increasingly around pensions and where that might sit. “When I talk about common ground, let’s start from the place where we have most agreement which is: we want decent, accessible health services, we want an economy, an economic model and prosperity that can fund decent public services, we want quality jobs and above all else we want the best opportunities and future for our young people and our children.” Pressed on whether nationalists would have to show willingness to compromise on flags and a national anthem she said: “Yes, but we come to the table firstly as republicans. We all have to accept our starting points. People will bring their views. We have to be prepared to talk about everything ... That’s the great beauty of democratic dialogue.” Speaking on Sky News earlier on Sunday, Northern Ireland’s new First Minister Michelle O’Neill has said she expects a vote on Irish unity to take place in the next decade. Gillian Keegan, the UK secretary for education, said she did not want to speculate on the comments by Ms O’Neill, who described it as the “decade of opportunity”. Ms O’Neill said change could “benefit us all” in Northern Ireland. “I believe also equally that we can do two things at once; we can have powersharing, we can make it stable, we can work together every day in terms of public services while we also pursue our equally legitimate aspirations.” Asked if this meant there would be a unity referendum in the next decade, Ms O’Neill said: “Yes. I believe we are in a decade of opportunity and there are so many things that are changing. “All the old norms, the nature of this estate, the fact that a nationalist/republican was never supposed to be First Minister. “This all speaks to that change.” Ms Keegan told the programme it was “fantastic” to see Stormont back up and running. Asked about the unity comments, she said: “I don’t want to speculate on that.” Under the Belfast Agreement, the power to call a Border poll rests with the Northern Ireland Secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris. Meanwhile, the SDLP has suspended the Laois GAA football manager Justin McNulty after he left a sitting of the Northern Assembly “without permission” to attend a GAA match. Mr McNulty, who was elected as an Assembly member for Newry and Armagh in May 2022, was at Stormont for the restoration of the North’s political institutions on Saturday, but left before his party colleague Matthew O’Toole was appointed as leader of the Opposition. Instead, he drove to Wexford and was on the sidelines for the county’s Division Four match against Laois at 6pm. An SDLP spokesman confirmed it suspended the whip from Mr McNulty on Saturday evening. “All SDLP MLAs were informed by the party’s chief whip that attendance at today’s sitting was mandatory for the duration of the Assembly proceedings. “This was a historic day that saw the restoration of devolved Government, the election of the first nationalist First Minister and Leader of the Opposition. People rightly expect their elected representatives to be there for work,” the spokesman said. “We expected all members of our team to be there to support their colleagues. “Accordingly, as Mr McNulty was not in his place, did not seek the permission for his absence and breached the direct instruction of the whip, the SDLP chief whip has suspended the whip with immediate effect.” – Additional reporting: PA",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Gardaí to get powers to seize digital and online evidence under law to be approved by Cabinet Minister for Justice Helen McEntee will tell colleagues that new Bill will allow gardaí target criminal evidence retained on online servers ‘in the cloud’  Gardaí will be given new powers to seize online and digital evidence, often stored in the cloud, under proposed new legislation which will be considered by the Cabinet on Tuesday. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee will seek Cabinet approval to draft new legislation to help the force tackle elements of crime that exist or operate online. The General Scheme for the Criminal Justice (Protection, Preservation and Access to Data on Information Systems) Bill, 2024, will ensure that gardaí have access to the most up-to-date and effective powers for getting swift access to criminal evidence which is in digital form. Current legislation allowing the seizure of evidence is not regarded as sufficient to target information, assets, and evidence that is retained in digital form. Traditional laws have provided for searches and seizures of objects from physical spaces. Most predate the substantial technological changes that have taken place over the past quarter of a century. Ms McEntee will tell colleagues that new tools will be required to address criminal activity in the virtual space, with footprints accessible only on private cloud infrastructures. The new draft Bill is designed to provide gardaí with the necessary tools to gain access to online evidence easily and efficiently. Safeguards will also be put in place to respect the privacy rights of individuals. Under the legislation gardaí will be able to apply for preservation and production orders to be served on internet service providers. These orders will oblige technology companies to preserve and produce digital evidence held on their systems. Separately, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien will bring a memo to Cabinet seeking approval of the transfer of nine additional sites to the Land Development Agency (LDA), for the development of over 3,000 homes over the medium to long term. The sites are at Bluebell, Dublin; Carrickmines Little, Dublin; Bolton Street car park, Waterford; Waterside car park, Waterford; Galway Harbour; Rosbrien Road, Limerick; St Overran’s Hospital, Waterford; Model Farm Road, Cork; and at the Central Bank of Ireland lands at Sandyford, Co Dublin. These sites will be earmarked for the development of between 2,800 to 3,330 homes.

"Mary Lou McDonald follows in Lincoln’s footsteps at unity summit for Irish American backers Sinn Féin leader spoke in New York of an Ireland for Shankill Road and Falls Road alike, seeking to update her party’s image in the US A bright, sparkling day in lower Manhattan and if the Great Hall at Cooper Union, a cavernous basement in a building that stands as a gorgeous monument to New York’s 19th-century rise, has not seen sunlight in its 150 years, it has witnessed plenty of dazzling moments of imperishable oratorial light. On Friday lunchtime, a crowd snaked around the brown-brick building in anticipation of witnessing the latest of those performances. The address by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald formed the centrepiece of the Irish Unity Summit, a daylong event organised by a collaboration of Irish-American groups. It was an inspired choice of venue. Famously, Abraham Lincoln was among the first speakers in a venue that became a natural gathering point for serious discussion and debate among Manhattanites of the day. But the hall has played host to a series of presidents through to Barack Obama and countless orators and agitators. “I will not compare directly our keynote speaker to Abraham Lincoln and, for the record, while she has been here in New York City, she has not attended any plays,” joked Mark Guilfoyle, the president of Friends of Sinn Féin, in his introduction. But when McDonald took the stage to a standing ovation, it was a previous Irish speaker on the same stage to whom she referred, James Connolly, she said had “described himself as an Irish agitator. Well, I…” She had to pause at this point to allow for another sustained bout of applause. “I stand here as an Irish agitator following in Connolly’s footsteps dedicated to the cause of unity, prosperity and Irish nationhood.” McDonald’s 20-minute speech was true to her style: assured and delivered with warm conviction. In truth, she had them at hello. She told the audience that “seismic generational change is under way in Ireland and the old certainties are collapsing. She quoted Edward Carson: “What a fool I was. I was only a puppet. And so was Ulster and so was Ireland.” She touched on the futility of partition and castigated the British Conservative governments who “never cared for the people of Northern Ireland.” She envisaged a referendum on a united Ireland as achievable by the end of this decade and told the crowd: “The new Ireland we seek belongs every bit to the families of the Shankill as to the Falls.” It was a strong speech and engaged the crowd – and they continued to file through the arched doorways all afternoon. And in atmosphere, the occasion signalled how far and how fast Sinn Féin is travelling from what it once symbolised to Irish Americans living along the east-coast corridor in the 1980s and 1990s. Mike Ireland (”Can you spell that one?”) and Eamon Burke travelled with friends down from their home in Springfield, Massachusetts, for the day. Just to hear. They laughed as they recalled a previous conversation with The Irish Times. It was in the early 1990s, in Hartford, and they’d both had a skinful. Gerry Adams was in town. “It is difficult from an American point of view: we are all about the unionists and the British did this but they [Sinn Féin] are taking it from the point of view: ‘We are representing all of the people,’” Mike Ireland says of the difference between the Sinn Féin of that era and today. “They are saying: ‘We are representing the unionists too.’ Which is why, I believe, they went to the king’s coronation. It is not just Catholic-Protestant. It is Northern Irish.” Eamon Burke left Galway decades ago but has watched the rise in the polls Sinn Féin has enjoyed on his periodic raids home. “The work they are doing there to be the voice of the voiceless,” he says when asked what impressed him about them. “If you are not part of the FFG grouping, a lot of people have been let down. People who may have jobs but they are rotten jobs and if you can pay the mortgage you can barely pay the childcare. The way they have stepped up and represented those people, the voiceless.” In an odd way, one of the most powerful moments of the afternoon lay in the brief tribute to Rita O’Hare, the Belfast republican woman who became a beloved figure in American Sinn Féin circles in her role as Friends of Sinn Féin leader. O’Hare moved from arrest, in 1972, for the attempted murder of a British army officer and served three years in Limerick on explosives charges. Her prominence within Sinn Féin rankled many unionists but her esteem within the American wing of the party was made clear yesterday. “Rita was a force of nature. A leader. A patriot who loved Ireland and our people. She was our friend. We loved her dearly and we miss her terribly,” McDonald said. A montage of photographs – Gerry Adams hirsute and in his halcyon days as leader; Martin McGuinness in front of an airport departures board, bound for Amerikay – was accompanied by a tribute narrated by McDonald. It was a clever invocation and nod to the Sinn Féin of the 1990s and the party that Mary Lou McDonald fronts today, as she acknowledged a rapturous reception and, like many speakers in the fabled hall, promised a better tomorrow.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.3970893112112241,False
"Sinn Féin urged to apologise to families of IRA campaign in ‘specific way’ Former commissioner for victims says while First Minister Michelle O’Neill’s apology to families is a move in the right direction, Sinn Féin needs to be more clear about what it’s sorry for Northern Ireland’s former commissioner for victims  has called on Sinn Féin to apologise to families of alleged informers killed by the IRA in a “specific way”  agreed to by the families.  The comments came after Sinn Féin’s leader in  Northern Ireland,  First Minister Michelle O’Neill, last week apologised to the families of alleged informers killed by the IRA. However, Judith Thompson said that while Ms O’Neill’s apology to families was a move in the right direction, the party needed to be more clear about  what it was sorry for. Her comments followed the publication of the interim findings of Operation Kenova, which examined 101 murders and abductions linked to the Provisional IRA’s so-called “nutting squad”, which was responsible for interrogating, torturing and murdering people suspected of passing information to British  security forces during the Troubles. The report calls on the republican leadership to apologise to bereaved relatives and victims of the IRA’s internal security unit (ISU) and those who suffered under linked campaigns of intimidation against them. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald  said she has a sense of “sorrow and regret” for everyone who was hurt and harmed during the conflict in Northern Ireland. Ms Thompson told BBC Northern Ireland’s Sunday Politics show that this was a move in the “right direction”. “But for an apology to be meaningful… it needs to be specific, it needs to be given in a way which has actually been agreed with the families involved as being what they need to see,” she added. “What is said has to be what they need to hear. Also, it needs to be given at a place, a time and by a person that has meaning for them. This kind of statement is a look in the right direction, but it doesn’t deliver the apology. “Apology without openness and information isn’t acknowledgment. The fact that there’s been an investigation, that the actual facts are acknowledged, and what the apology is for, is absolutely clear and acknowledged, is really important too.” Ms Thompson said the report’s findings are “clear and unequivocal” for victims. “It tells them that much of what they believed was correct, which tells them that what happened to them was wrong, should not have happened, and acknowledges the pain and the wrong that they suffered,” she added. The report also calls on the British government to apologise for the security forces’ failings amid a “maverick” culture for handling agents and intelligence. Ms Thompson said  an apology from the government is “fundamental” to the families. “The level of stigma, isolation (and) intimidation that these families were subjected to, often within their own communities and by those who perpetrated those murders, stand out. It must have been the most terrible experience,” she said. “Acknowledgement is right up there in terms of what they want to see happen. Some people want prosecutions, other people feel differently. But the demand for truth and acknowledgment of the wrongness of it – I think those are the really important messages which this report steps towards, and apologies are clearly a part of that.” – PA",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Rory Hearne to run in European elections as Social Democrat candidate Academic and housing policy commentator to run in Midlands-North-West constituency Rory Hearne, the academic and housing policy commentator, has been selected to run in the forthcoming European elections as a Social Democrats candidate in Midlands-North-West. Mr Hearne (44) is an associate professor in social policy at Maynooth University and author of Gaffs, an examination of Ireland’s housing crisis. Announcing his candidacy on Tuesday, he said he believed the housing crisis can be solved, and that the Social Democrats have demonstrated the most political will to do so. “As an MEP, I want to stand up for generation locked out by bringing the housing crisis to the top of the political agenda in Europe, and by using my role to put pressure on the Irish Government to implement the solutions and bring about a fairer future for us all,” he said in a statement. Party leader Holly Cairns described Mr Hearne as a prominent voice on the most important issue facing Ireland. “EU policy decisions affect every aspect of our lives and our communities.

Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air.

" Audit identifies just 500 extra beds for asylum seekers despite 4,300 Ukrainians leaving accommodation Department of Integration sourced beds with providers who are contracted to house Ukrainians which can be converted to accommodate asylum seekers An audit of emergency accommodation for migrants has found roughly 500 extra beds, despite thousands of Ukrainians leaving their accommodation while hundreds of asylum seekers remain unaccommodated. Figures compiled by the Department of Integration show there are 4,300 fewer Ukrainians in hotels and other serviced accommodation compared with the start of the year, while 1,260 people seeking international protection remain unaccommodated. A spokesman for Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman said on Wednesday the department had sourced “several hundred” beds with providers who are contracted to house Ukrainians which can be converted to accommodation for asylum seekers. “We have undertaken an audit of capacity and have started engaging with providers, and have identified an initial several hundred beds which can be converted. That process is now under way.” It is understood that about 500 extra beds were identified through that process. The department said it was a commercial decision for providers who to accommodate. It is understood there are about 2,500 “potential vacancies” among beds contracted for Ukrainians, due to people leaving and fewer arrivals, but the department said they were not necessarily available due to room configuration demands and to keep some capacity available should contracts end elsewhere. Government sources said on Wednesday that some providers who had housed Ukrainians no longer wanted to rent space to the State, while the State was also looking to maximise value for money and avoid unsuitable locations. The most recently published statistics show there are 53,694 Ukrainians in serviced accommodation, compared with 58,007 at the start of the year. The department said since January, it had found an extra 2,400 beds approximately, but the accommodation situation remained dire even as demand for Ukrainian housing dwindled as arrivals dropped. “Despite exhaustive efforts by the department, the supply of accommodation has very seriously diminished, while at the same time the highest ever monthly international protection applications occurred in January and in February. “What accommodation can be opened faces significant local opposition and at this point is primarily being utilised for families in order to avoid women and children becoming homeless. “Notwithstanding the current challenges, officials are seeking to expedite a solution for those who are rough sleeping. Intensive work is under way to offer a safe place of shelter to as many unaccommodated IP applicants as possible.” It comes as the Government faces ongoing pressure from the Opposition to house those on the streets, many of whom are living in a makeshift encampment in Dublin, and criticism from civil society groups over changes to accommodation and welfare supports for Ukrainians. Social Democrats integration spokeswoman Jennifer Whitmore wrote to Roderic O’Gorman on Wednesday raising concerns about the lack of sanitation and running water at the encampment as well as safety concerns for those living there. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, Labour’s justice spokesman, said they were in “particularly degrading conditions”. He said there was a “victim punishment” approach from the Government so people were discouraged from coming. From today, Ukrainians arriving in Ireland will be accommodated for 90 days in specific accommodation centres before being asked to move on, and welfare entitlements while in State accommodation have been cut to €38.80 for an adult and €29.80 per child. On Wednesday, the Government confirmed the location of almost 2,000 beds for Ukrainian refugees across five different locations around the country, in centres in Dublin, Laois, Limerick, Kildare and Cork. Emma Lane Spollen of the Ukraine Civil Society Forum accused the Government of “washing its hands” of the challenge of accommodating Ukrainians. In January, the forum told Mr O’Gorman it was “deeply concerned” about the changes and said they were creating a “system based on deterrence”. Sinn Féin said the cut in welfare should apply to all those here from Ukraine, not just new arrivals, and opposed the new 90-day limit.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.815671759256527,False
"Sinn Féin’s battle to engage the Irish-American heart, mind and wallet when it comes to Irish reunification The lives of the modern, career-focused Irish in the States are a far cry from those of the immigrants who escaped a moribund Ireland in the 80s and 90s The date of Friday’s Sinn Féin powwow in the heart of Manhattan, framed around Mary Lou McDonald’s generous and inclusive vision of a harmonious, unified Ireland, was lost on no Irish-American of a certain generation. Thirty years have jogtrotted by since Gerry Adams was granted a visa waiver which allowed him to visit New York for a highly contentious February visit, which Sir Patrick Mayhew, the former Northern Ireland secretary, had attempted to block with an eleventh hour call to the US ambassador to Britain, Ray Seitz. “The fact was Adams had to renounce violence. Granting this favour before that would be completely wrong – in NI terms and also dangerous in terms of the US/UK relationship,” Mayhew told him. No matter. Adams travelled. The conference, held in the Waldorf Astoria, was packed to capacity and, reflecting on the 25th year anniversary of that visit, Adams was able to say tell the BBC that, symbolically, the visit was “important in showing that you could build an alternative to armed struggle, and you could enlist support from powerful people in the USA”. In 1994, Manhattan was flooded with young Irish people. A piece in the Los Angeles Times from 1989 quoted statistics that over 100,000 had ‘slipped’ into the United States without documentation since 1982. In a year when the southern US border has become the most contentious issue of the upcoming election, the word ‘slipped’ conjures up a nimble, easily-achieved feat for the illegal Irish. And it was. Irish people simply flew into Logan, to O’Hare and JFK, and didn’t leave. That piece depicted the new arrivals of having escaped a moribund home country. “There’s more Irish here than I ever dreamed of,” one Irish woman – they withheld their names – told the reporter. “The pubs at home are empty.” The arrival of Adams; the ceasefire that summer; the party leader’s hugely-publicised 10-city tour that September; all were instrumental in the metamorphosis of Sinn Féin. Last Friday’s event was, understandably, more subdued in mood and measured in tone. The energy generated by the influx of the 1980s/1990s Irish has dissipated because some moved home and those who stayed built lives and moved to the suburbs, ceding the city to the next generation of young. The old trick of ‘slipping’ into America is no longer so easy. Visas are more difficult to come by, and the Irish who do live and work in the city are here through choice and career opportunity rather than the lack of alternative which provoked the great influx in the 1980s. Little wonder, then, that the age profile in the Great Hall in Cooper Union was not particularly young. There was a decent crowd and the afternoon programme was engaging. The theme of the panel discussions which followed McDonald’s opening address spelt out where Sinn Féin see themselves three decades after Adams’ feted arrival. Professor Brendan O’Leary and author Megan Stack spoke about ‘the pathway to unity’. Jack McGarry, the founder of The Dead Rabbit pub, and Sophie Colgan, who hosts the Navigating New York podcast, spoke about the seldom-heard story of the Irish who have made lives in New York over the past decade or two. And it became clear, as the afternoon passed, that the event was a concerted attempt by Sinn Féin to engage the Irish-American heart, mind and wallet when it comes to the next historic step in the evolution of Ireland. “I heard a lot of people talking and say, OK, we have had this awful trauma collectively,” Mary Lou McDonald noted at one point during the panel conversation that closed the event. “We had conflict. We have endured and inflicted pain. We get to peace. And there is a danger that people think: that’s done. Ireland’s done. “We need to rally the United States to the reunification agenda. We are hitting a reset button here. It is part of the same journey, but it has got a different focus now. There will be a [US] presidential election in the autumn. Irish reunification: why is that not a question for whoever occupies the White House at that time?” Whether the next occupant of the White House is especially interested in answering or even thinking about that question remains to be seen. But in the haloed, windowless chamber of the Great Hall, the mood was of an irreversible move towards referendum and an All-Ireland island. And had you happened to walk down Astor place, as the great-granddaughter or grandson of a Kelly or Murphy, wholeheartedly American but still aware of this old-country family legacy, and wandered into Cooper Union out of curiosity, you could be forgiven, listening to the conversations, for assuming that the Auld Sod is even now agog with debate about an imminent referendum on a united Ireland. “I think we are all agreed that we are at a very particular inflection point in Irish history,” McDonald remarked. “And the Irish journey and all of us want to help in an instructive and an inclusive way. The United States will be absolutely central to this journey over the next decade.” Maybe. That LA Times piece is extraordinary to read now in the context of contemporary Ireland because it tells of an Irish-New York experience as thoroughly vanished as the Clancy Brothers holding a young Bob Dylan enthral in the White Horse Tavern. Irish New York in 1989 was a city of construction and bar work and the pubs thick with cigarette smoke and the lyrics of Shane MacGowan. A Chinese grocery store in Queens advertising Irish bacon. Lines of people gathering at Gibbons Import Store in Jackson Heights to grab one of the coveted 4,000 provincial newspapers shipped across the Atlantic every weekend. Nothing like reading the town notes from 3,000 miles away. There was a latent energy in the Irish American enclaves of the great cities then which may not be as easily to harness this time round. But Sinn Féin have a history of engaging the goodwill of United States power brokers and from the stage in Cooper Union issued a clear intention to begin a new chapter, even if thousands are no longer sailing.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.42902369599361306,False
"Former HSE boss sounded out as new chair of RTÉ board Paul Reid is one of a number of potential candidates understood to have been approached Former Health Service Executive chief executive Paul Reid has been sounded out by the Government about the possibility of becoming the new chair of the RTÉ board. Mr Reid is understood to be one of a number of potential candidates informally approached in recent days. No decisions have been made and discussions in Government and with potential candidates are likely to continue over the weekend. Ministers have indicated they hope to appoint a new chair next week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin said on Friday that her “immediate focus is on appointing a new chair and additional members very shortly to ensure that the board can continue its important work”. Senior Government sources say, however, that any new appointments will not be solely a decision for Ms Martin, with the three party leaders likely to be closely involved in the process. There have been discussions on possible candidates in recent days, and it is understood that some have been lobbying for the post. Others are not keen, however. It is understood that Prof Brian MacCraith, who chaired the Future of Media Commission and oversaw the successful roll-out of the vaccine programme during the Covid pandemic, and whose name had been widely floated in RTÉ, is not interested in the role. There was a further departure from the broadcaster’s board yesterday when PJ Mathews, an associate professor in the School of English, Drama and Film at UCD, resigned citing work commitments. Mr Mathews’s departure means there are currently five vacancies on the board of RTÉ, including the chairperson role. Two of the seats on the 12-person board have been vacant for just over four months and another has been empty since just before Christmas. As well as a successor to former chairwoman Siún Ní Raghallaigh, who resigned last week, the Government has to find four other people prepared to serve on the board of the embattled national broadcaster, which has been hit by a string of controversies since June last year. A spokeswoman confirmed that the quorum for the board is seven members – meaning it can now function only with a 100 per cent attendance rate. Speaking after a meeting with the board yesterday, Ms Martin said the encounter had been “positive and forward looking”. Ms Martin said she had been given an update of the board’s “important work” on “RTÉ's new strategy and the reforms which have been put in place”. Ms Martin added: “I also provided assurances of my absolute commitment to a Government decision on a new and sustainable funding model by the summer.” However, the Government remains sharply divided on Ms Martin’s preference to scrap the licence fee and replace it with direct State funding. A statement from the RTÉ board welcomed the “open and constructive meeting, focused on the future of RTÉ and public-service media”.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Neasa Hourigan reveals she twice took cocaine as she calls for decriminalisation of all drugs Green Party TD opens up about her party leadership ambitions in wide-ranging interview with Hot Press magazine Green Party TD Neasa Hourigan has opened up about her history of drug-taking, revealing she twice took cocaine. “I tried it twice and I liked it so much I didn’t try it again, and that’s a scary thing,” she said. “I didn’t like myself on it. It was like a hyper version of myself. It gave me a fright.” Ms Hourigan also revealed that she has taken ecstasy in the past, stating that it “wasn’t a big thing” for her. “It didn’t change my life or anything. I wasn’t looking for it every weekend ... I’ve tried lots of different things.” In a wide-ranging interview in Hot Press magazine published on Thursday, Ms Hourigan backed the decriminalisation of “every single illegal drug”, including heroin and cocaine. “I don’t think you should criminalise somebody who is taking a drug,” she said. She said that the Government should legislate for the fact that “a high percentage of people” use marijuana in a safe way. Ms Hourigan also revealed her ambitions for leadership within the Green Party, but admitted that the party “could be decimated” in the next general election. She said she would have no issue with going into government with Sinn Féin. “If people are democratically elected, you have to accept what the populace returns.

Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told?

"Long-awaited immigration plan will commit to avoiding use of ‘last hotel’ in a town for asylum seekers State will for now continue to rely on hotels where more than one is operating in a locality after angry backlashes in some areas The Government’s landmark new immigration plan will commit to avoiding the use of the “last hotel” in a town to accommodate asylum seekers. Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman will bring the long-awaited plan to Cabinet today  alongside measures to overhaul immigration procedures from Minister for Justice Helen McEntee. However, for the time being, the State will continue to rely on hotels where more than one is operating in a locality. Moves to accommodate asylum seekers in a town’s only operational hotel have led to angry backlashes including at the D Hotel in Drogheda and the Racket Hall hotel in Roscrea. Local representatives and residents have complained that closing functioning amenities deprives towns of commercial income for neighbouring businesses and leaves communities with nowhere to hold events. Far-right activists have travelled to protests held at these and other proposed accommodation centres, while the Government has been forced to scramble and back solutions such as a “community hotel” in Roscrea. Government sources said  the issue of the “last hotel” in a town being used would become less prevalent as more accommodation is brought on stream. Mr O’Gorman’s strategy aims to address the immediate crisis and introduce longer-term reforms of the system along the lines envisaged in a previous plan to scrap the direct provision system, which has been thrown badly off course by the crisis, sources said. The Coalition’s goal is to move away from a “total reliance” on private providers towards State-owned accommodation alongside commercial providers which will be held to higher standards. There will be an expanded programme of purchasing and construction of accommodation, as well as the use of State-owned land for modular units and conversion of unused offices for housing international protection applicants. The intention is to publish the plan after Cabinet meets. It is thought  it will come with a hefty price tag, and senior sources predicted  it will not defuse tensions over immigration in the short term. Mr O’Gorman has previously said it will be “a number of years” before enough accommodation is on stream to allow for a “steady state” in the new system, and that there will be ongoing reliance on the private sector in the interim. Meanwhile, Ms McEntee is to seek approval to “opt in” to the EU’s Asylum and Migration pact, devised late last year. The decision will commit Ireland to replace existing laws on international protection which sources said would represent the biggest reform of Irish immigration law in decades. It will oblige Ireland to conduct enhanced screening and security checks while also seeking to cut down on so-called “secondary movements”, which the Government believes have been a particular problem for Ireland. It will introduce legally binding timeframes for making decisions on applications and appeals and focus on “efficient returns” for unsuccessful applicants, as well as faster processing for people coming from safe countries, arriving without or with false documents, or who have crossed borders illegally. There will be a new border procedure to speed up processing for those unlikely to be granted asylum, as well as a commitment that will either force countries to make a financial contribution or accept asylum seekers from under-pressure countries. There will also be expanded checking of the categories of migrants who will be fingerprinted for checking against a centralised European database.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.33909607127893304,False
"State to provide 14,000 new beds for asylum seekers through turnkey properties, empty offices and rapid-builds Minister for Justice reviewing eight nations which could be added to existing list of safe countries of origin A new plan to accommodate asylum seekers will see the State provide 14,000 beds by the end of 2028, as part of a wider plan to make 35,000 spaces available across the system. Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman said the new beds will delivered through a mix of building and buying. New spaces in reception and integration centres will be delivered through acquiring larger turnkey properties, taking over empty offices and commercial buildings, and rolling out rapid builds on State-owned lands. The Department of Integration plans to lease two locations from the HSE and one from the Department of Justice. Rapid build prefabs will be built on this land. The HSE sites identified include Crooksling, near Dublin, and one near Newtownmountkennedy in Wicklow. The plan is based on projections that a system with capacity for up to 35,000 asylum seekers will be needed by the end of 2028. That is assuming that between 13,000 to 16,000 arrive on average per year between 2024 and 2028, and that people granted refugee status move from their accommodation. Each international protection applicant will be allowed to remain in the reception centre for six months. Accommodation centres will then be needed for people who have passed the six month mark but are still awaiting a decision. Under existing criteria, they can stay there for 12 months. The Government plans to continue using emergency commercial accommodation in the short to medium term, but intends to scale this down as more State places become available. Meanwhile, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has confirmed that she is reviewing the status of eight further countries which could be added to the list of safe countries of origin. There are currently 10 on the list. This could mean faster processing times for people arriving from those countries. At present, there are 28,181 beds available in the system. This comprises 20,824 spaces in emergency commercial accommodation, 6,173 beds in permanent IPAS centres and some 1,184 State owned beds. Under the Coalition’s new plan, there will in future be 35,000 beds. This will comprise 10,000 spaces in emergency commercial accommodation, 11,000 beds in contingency commercial accommodation, some 1,000 community State owned beds, and 13,000 other State owned beds.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU.

"Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s ferocious response is full of problems for Catherine Martin Minister for Media not under immediate threat following RTÉ ex-chair’s riposte, but the scandal rumbles on, shifting focus from fixing the station’s problems Last Thursday, Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin delivered a steady-handed defence of her actions in the run-in to Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s resignation as chair of the RTÉ board. However, her performance at the Oireachtas media committee had a weak point: it brought the focus intensely on Ní Raghallaigh, foregrounding her actions in the lead up to a bombshell interview by Martin on Prime Time which prompted the resignation. The risk was always that there would be a riposte from the former RTÉ chair. On Monday afternoon she delivered a ferocious repudiation of Martin which will deepen and prolong the crisis – something the former chair says she does not want, but the subtext of her 2,300-word statement is that she had no choice. The statement immediately caused shock waves in the political system, the Opposition ramping up the pressure on Martin, talk of further committee hearings and rumblings of concern privately expressed from within the ranks of the Government. And it is not hard to see why: Ní Raghallaigh’s statement is full of problems for Martin. Just a few paragraphs in, she explicitly tackles evidence given to the committee last week by Martin, who told Malcolm Byrne that she had had “monthly meetings” supplemented by direct emails and phone calls with Ní Raghallaigh. This was flatly contradicted by the ex-chair, who said this was “not true” and she had had “only a handful” of direct meetings in 15 months. There is manifold criticism of Martin’s overall approach to the crisis, as well as specific instances. At its most stinging, it directly mirrors the language of Martin’s harshest critics, stating Ní Raghallaigh’s experience “has been of a Minister actively taking a hands-off approach”. She suggests Martin acted contrary to good governance, which prescribes regular contact between Minister and chair, saying she had “no choice but to accept” regular contact would be through the secretary general of the department – “not typical”, she says. She petitioned Martin to appoint board members when some stepped down seven months ago – “However, no appointments were made,” she says, criticising the lack of financial acumen on the board of an organisation in “deep financial trouble”. She skewers Martin’s infamous failure to be prescriptive about whether people should pay the licence fee, saying she was “not assisted by the Minister who said she would refuse to tell licence payers what to do”. Of the fateful Prime Time interview, she outlines feeling a “plan was afoot” involving the programme. Martin’s reason for raising the dramatic rupture in relations on the programme, which made her position untenable, was that she believed it was about to break publicly anyway. Ní Raghallaigh’s statement effectively argues this is faulty as only one relevant press query had been submitted, due for response the following day – although it must be noted that some reporters had picked up on the ructions that day as it circulated within some senior circles in Government. Perhaps the most damaging point is a little arcane – but it is worth thrashing out. Martin moved against the RTÉ chair for failing to provide her with accurate information about board sign-off for an exit package for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. The RTÉ board argued that the information had been conveyed by Ní Raghallaigh in a phone call on October 9th – and should constructively have been grasped by the politicians and officials due to new rules on the role of the board’s remuneration committee – the thrust of this being that Ní Raghallaigh was unfairly attacked for omitting information which already resided in the department. Martin poured cold water on this last week, repeatedly saying that Ní Raghallaigh had told officials only that she “imagined that she would have referred to” the committee’s role. The former chair’s statement – three times – emphasises that she told the department of the involvement of the remuneration committee in the decision, and that last week she told officials that she “would imagine” that had been passed on to the Minister. “A different construction is now being put on that, my use of the word ‘imagine’ is now being misrepresented. “I cannot remain silent about the manner of my enforced dismissal which seemed designed to traduce my reputation,” she adds. The RTÉ story has shown capacity to rapidly evolve – to re-spawn as a new sublineage of scandal, sucking more people in. Nobody seems able to put a floor under it. The latest chapter on exit payments has claimed the RTÉ chair, winged the new director general and damaged the Minister, just as she prepares to install a new chair – the timing is exquisitely inconvenient for Martin. The Opposition seems slow to bring matters to a head with a confidence vote, and in the absence of any unlikely revolt from within the Government, she will continue. But so will the palaver at RTÉ – making the Coalition’s task of alighting on a formula for the future funding of the broadcaster more fraught still.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Ex-RTÉ board chair unsuccessfully sought phone call with Catherine Martin during hectic exchanges before her resignation A cache of documents sent to the Oireachtas Media Committee contains an account of phone calls between Siún Ní Raghallaigh and the Department of Media Former RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh unsuccessfully sought a phone call with Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin during a hectic series of exchanges in the run-in to her resignation. However, no phone call was arranged and Ms Ní Raghallaigh ultimately resigned, having told Ms Martin she would do so if she received a letter expressing disappointment over the former chair’s failure to give accurate information about the board’s involvement in approving an exit package for RTÉ's former chief financial officer. When asked why there was no direct phone call that evening, Ms Martin has previously indicated her preference at the time was for a face to face meeting with officials. A cache of documents sent to the Oireachtas media committee contains an account of phone calls between Ms Ní Raghallaigh and the department on February 22nd, starting with the clarification from the RTÉ chair at 10am that the remuneration committee had signed off on Richard Collins’ deal. The crux of the crisis is that Ms Ní Raghallaigh has argued she previously made clear to the department that the board had a role in signing off on the package, but later misremembered and told Ms Martin that it had not. Ms Martin later stated publicly the board had no role, and latterly lost trust in the RTÉ chair following the 10am phone call, precipitating her dramatic resignation. At 2pm, a senior official, Triona Quill, called Ms Ní Raghallaigh and told her of the Minister’s concern, with the chair responding that she had phoned the former secretary general last October to say a deal had been done. It states that Ms Ní Raghallaigh told the official that “she imagined that she would have also referred to the role of the remuneration committee in that conversation”. Ms Ní Raghallaigh has disputed whether she said this, saying her use of the word “imagined” referred to what she thought the secretary general told the Minister in October. In her statement on Monday, the former chair said that her use of the word “is now being misrepresented” and on three occasions insisted she had told the Department about the role of the committee. In the same call, Ms Ní Raghallaigh was told that Ms Martin was considering sending a letter outlining her disappointment. Half an hour later, according to the note, Ms Ní Raghallaigh rang the secretary general, Feargal Ó Coigligh, of the department and “expressed her unhappiness at the prospect of receiving a letter from the Minister” and said if one arrived, it “would demonstrate a lack of confidence in her as chair and that she felt she would be unable to remain on in the position”. Later that day, the former secretary general Katherine Licken told Mr Ó Coigligh that she had no recollection of being told Mr Collins’ exit deal had been approved by the remuneration committee. Shortly before 7pm, the secretary general rang Ms Ní Raghallaigh telling her that Ms Martin was planning to go on Prime Time and if asked, she “could not conceal” that she had been given the wrong information, and that she had decided to issue the letter and to seek a formal meeting. Ms Ní Raghallaigh said she was unhappy about that development and would resign if she received the letter – and would be happy to speak to the Minister on the phone. In her statement on Monday, the former chair said that at this point she formed the view that a “plan was afoot” involving the letter and the Prime Time appearance. At 7.30pm, the assistant secretary made a final phone call to Ms Ní Raghallaigh telling her Ms Martin had decided to issue the letter. The document pack also contains the brief letter sent by Ms Martin, which outlines how she was asked if there was any board involvement in Mr Collins’ exit package. “You advised me that the Board had no role. You have today clarified that this was an error and that the Remuneration Committee approved the severance package in relation to Mr Collins on 10 October 2023.” “I am deeply disappointed that I did not receive the correct information on this important matter,” she wrote, inviting to her to a meeting on the following morning at 10am to discuss the matter. Early the following morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned her position. Ms Martin also outlined 12 occasions she has met Ms Ní Raghallaigh since the crisis at RTÉ emerged on June 22nd last year. This comes after committee members probed her level of engagement – and after Ms Ní Raghallaigh said in her statement that it is “not true” that there were scheduled or formal meetings on a monthly basis, and that she had only “had a handful” of meetings with Ms Martin directly. Ms Martin also outlines how she met Ms Ní Raghallaigh on December 7th, 2022, on February 13th, 2023, and on May 10th, alongside the incoming director general Kevin Bakhurst. “This brings to 15 the number of meetings I had with the former chair over the 15 months of her tenure.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

"Final report into ‘Grace’ abuse case delayed for further six months The inquiry, chaired by senior counsel Marjorie Farrelly, was supposed to report two years after its establishment in 2017, but has now been delayed on multiple occasions The final report of the inquiry into the so-called ‘Grace’ case, concerning allegations of a case of serious sexual and physical abuse in the south east, has been delayed by a further six months, the Government has confirmed. The case relates to a non-verbal young woman with intellectual disabilities, given the pseudoynm Grace. There are allegations that she suffered years of abuse but remained at a foster home over a 10-year period, and despite concerns being highlighted about the setting. The inquiry, chaired by senior counsel Marjorie Farrelly, was supposed to report two years after its establishment in 2017, but has now been delayed on multiple occasions. In a statement following the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, a Government spokesman said that Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman, alongside Minister of State for Disability Anne Rabbitte, had received approval from Ministers to extend the timeframe for the final submission of the report by six months up to September 12th this year. The spokesman said: “This extension will allow the Commission the additional time necessary to bring its work to completion. “The Farrelly Commission is an independent statutory Commission of Investigation that was established to investigate the care and protection of a woman who is known by the pseudonym of ‘Grace’, as well as others in a former foster home in the South East, which has been the subject of abuse allegations.”",2,2_abuse_schools_religious_orders,"['abuse', 'schools', 'religious', 'orders', 'inquiry', 'report', 'survivors', 'scoping', 'sexual', 'redress']","['Labour calls for acceleration of divestment of schools from religious orders after abuse inquiry Ivana Bacik emphasises need for timely redress scheme and says her party willing to work with Government to make this happen The State should urgently reboot the process to divest schools from religious patronage, Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik has said. She said the process had been started by her party colleague Ruairí Quinn when Minister for Education in 2011 but had effectively stalled since he stood down as minister. The Labour leader made the call when responding to the publication of a scoping report which disclosed widespread sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders throughout the State. Speaking before the start of a special parliamentary meeting of her party at the Grand Hotel in Malahide, Ms Bacik also said it was vital that a Redress Scheme be run in parallel with the Commission of Investigation so that survivors are not waiting any longer for justice to be done for them. She also welcomed that the Garda had begun criminal investigations into some of the over 800 alleged abusers identified by victims in 308 schools. “We [need] to look at the divestment of schools from religious orders. For far too long, our school system in Ireland, uniquely in Europe, has been dominated by religious [orders].” She said that over 90 per cent of our primary schools still had religious patronage. “We need to ensure there’s divestment, that we see that the process initiated by Ruairí Quinn is now speeded up and continued, so that religious orders, complicit in such awful horrors in the past, no longer have authority over our schoolchildren in our education system.” She said a core “mission” of the Labour Party was to afford children the right to have an equal future and an equal start. She said in the last redress scheme – in relation to abuse which occurred in religious-run residential settings for children, the orders had not paid their fair share. “Far too many hid behind what we might describe as the developer’s wife system, where their assets were transferred to a trust. What we want to see with this new set of revelations is that the religious orders made to pay their share.” Ms Bacik told reporters it was her view that the Commission should begin its work by looking at the 308 schools included in the scoping inquiry and then extending to look at other schools. She again emphasised the need for a timely redress scheme and said her party was willing to work with the Government to make this happen. She said Minister for Education Norma Foley had worked very closely with other parties during the scoping inquiry and was very respectful of the wishes of survivors throughout the process. Asked if there was a means of ensuring that religious orders paid their share, Ms Bacik said there was nothing illegal about the trust system but there were “serious ethical questions” that had to be asked about why the orders had done so. Asked about the responsibility of the State, she said nobody was suggesting the religious orders should bear 100 per cent responsibility. “Clearly, the State was deeply at fault for failure to regulate, failure to ensure proper governance in schools, for really abdicating responsibility for running and governance of schools and management of schools to religious orders,” she said. Speaking about her party’s preparation for the general election, she said that it had already selected 16 candidates and was buoyed by strong results in the local and European elections. However, she would not put a figure on how many seats the party expected to win, other than to say she wanted to return with more seats than its present six. Ms Bacik said the party would not be involved in a vote transfer agreement with any other party before the general election. “After the election, certainly, we will look to sit down with those parties and representatives who share our vision, our centre left and social democratic values. “We will be looking to form a bloc for negotiations on any programme for Government to make sure that our Labour vision and values form the heart of the next Government.”', 'Major inquiry into sexual abuse in schools to be recommended by scoping report The scoping inquiry was commissioned last year after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by past pupils A scoping report on historical abuse at boarding and day schools run by religious orders is understood to recommend a statutory inquiry be set up to examine the sexual abuse of potentially thousands of children. The leaders of the Government parties discussed the issue on Tuesday night with the Minister for Education Norma Foley, whose department commissioned the scoping report by senior counsel Mary O’Toole last year. The report, which runs to more than 700 pages, was expected to be discussed by the Cabinet on Wednesday but that was postponed, three people familiar with the issue said. It is expected that officials will continue to work on a plan for publication of the report, and to work with survivors of abuse. It is likely to be approved by the Cabinet and published in September, after which a statutory inquiry is expected to be established. Once an inquiry has been concluded, it is likely that a redress scheme, to be funded at least in part by contributions from the religious order, will be established. The scoping inquiry was instituted last year by Ms Foley after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by a number of past pupils. The allegations first emerged when two brothers, David and Mark Ryan, spoke publicly of being sexually abused by priests at Blackrock College and its affiliate junior school, Willow Park. Both schools were run by the Spiritan congregation, formerly the Holy Ghost Fathers. The brothers first spoke about being sexually abused as boys in the south Dublin secondary school in an RTÉ radio documentary, Blackrock Boys, in 2022. They discovered each other’s abuse only in 2002, many years after it took place. Mark Ryan died last year in London after suffering a suspected heart attack. The documentary led to a wave of revelations and hundreds of survivors reporting they were also abused as boys in schools run by the Spiritans, as well as other congregations who ran day and boarding schools in the past. It later emerged that more than 140 people reported incidences of child sexual abuse involving 18 abusers to gardaí investigating such allegations at the schools in south Dublin. The scoping inquiry was set up by the Department of Education to advise the Government on the nature of the issue and the possible next steps. It was broadened to include allegations of abuse in religious-run boarding and day schools, and received more than 200 submissions. It is understood the report features schools runs by many different religious orders. The report was delivered to Ms Foley in early June. It is understood it has estimated that there may be thousands of cases of sexual abuse in the schools. Ms Foley and her officials have been working on proposals which will be heavily influenced by the wishes of survivors of abuse in the schools. The terms of reference for the scoping exercise specifically required that Ms O’Toole, in making recommendations to the Government, should have regard to “alignment with outcomes sought by survivors of historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders”. It says this should be “informed by the survivor engagement process” which has been part of the scoping inquiry’s work.', 'Statutory inquiry into sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools agreed at Cabinet Work on preparations for the inquiry by officials, including legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas, will begin shortly  The Government has formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools. Work on preparations for the inquiry by officials, including legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas, will begin shortly and there is also expected to be extensive consultations with survivors of abuse. The proposals were brought to the Government on Tuesday morning by Minister for Education Norma Foley following agreement among the three Coalition party leaders on Monday night. It is understood that the Government intends to set up a Commission of Investigation, in line with the report’s recommendations. Discussions on the terms of reference will take place over the coming weeks, it is expected, but the recommendation from the scoping report is that all types of school should be included, rather than just those run by religious orders. A scoping report into the allegations of abuse at schools run by religious orders – prompted by accounts of abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin, which in turn prompted an outpouring of similar stories – is expected to be published by the Government, perhaps as early as this evening. Ms Foley and her officials have been considering the 700-page report, commissioned last year from senior counsel Mary O’Toole following allegations of historic abuse at Blackrock College. The scoping inquiry conducted by Ms O’Toole included religious-run boarding and day schools, and it is understood that the report features schools run by many different religious orders. Sources say that there may be thousands of cases of sexual abuse in the schools. Officials are continuing to work on proposals for a redress scheme for victims of past abuse with at least part of the costs being met by the religious orders. Ms Foley and her officials have been drawing up plans which are expected to be heavily influenced by the wishes of survivors. The terms of reference for the scoping exercise specifically required that Ms O’Toole, when making recommendations to the Government, should have regard to “alignment with outcomes sought by survivors of historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders”. It says this should be “informed by the survivor engagement process” which has been part of the scoping inquiry’s work. An advocacy group for victims of sexual abuse in Spiritan schools said the establishment of a redress scheme only after the conclusion of any inquiry would result in “further delays to urgently needed justice”. A statement released by the Restore Together group said any statutory inquiry “must be structured to reflect the urgency of the situation” and by “putting the best interests of victims/survivors first”. The group said this could be done by “the concurrent operation of parallel strands of any inquiry aimed at providing healing, redress and justice”. Survivors received communication from the Government’s Survivor Engagement Lead Kieran McGrath on Tuesday morning informing them a copy of the report would be made available to them before it was published. “We recognise that receiving the Report is significant and that there is likely to be media coverage and discussion of the contents in the coming days. We understand that this may be difficult for you,” Mr McGrath said in an email on Tuesday. He also said that up to six sessions with a qualified counsellor would be made available to any survivor who requested it, with longer term support available from One in Four and other organisations.']",abuse - schools - religious - orders - inquiry - report - survivors - scoping - sexual - redress,1.0,False
"‘She said-she said’: The conflicts between  accounts of Catherine Martin and Siún Ní Raghallaigh Newly released documents reveal further details on interactions between Minister for Media and  former RTÉ chairwoman that led to the latter’s resignation last month   The latest documents relating to Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s resignation as RTÉ chair last month add further complexity to an already contested version of what transpired in the run  up to her stepping down. What do they reveal about the key events, and are we any closer to knowing exactly what happened and why? These records add to the “she said-she said” situation where gaps remain in the public’s knowledge of the high-profile falling out between a Government Minister and RTÉ's chairwoman. It was already known that there was frantic communication throughout the day on February 22nd, culminating with Ní Raghallaigh’s resignation in the early hours of February 23rd. Ní Raghallaigh had inaccurately told Minister for Media Catherine Martin that the board had no role in approving an exit package for former RTÉ chief financial officer Richard Collins – something she says was an oversight – and the Minister had gone out and repeated this to the media. The RTÉ chair rang Martin’s department on the morning of February 22nd to tell them of her error, prompting a flurry of phone calls across the day between Martin’s officials and Ní Raghallaigh. The documents supplied to the Oireachtas media committee show that as events reached a climax, Ní Raghallaigh offered to speak to Martin on the phone. This precise detail was not publicly known, although Martin had made clear at the committee last week that she didn’t feel a phone call was appropriate, and wanted her officials to be party to any exchange, hence her preference for a meeting. But Martin  also knew, because by this stage Ní Raghallaigh had threatened to resign several times, that if Martin sent a letter communicating her disappointment, the RTÉ chair would resign. It is difficult to know exactly what weight to put on this: one interpretation is that Martin spurned a phone call and a potential chance to de-escalate matters. Another is that a phone call would likely have been fruitless and led to all parties simply restating their positions. Martin’s preference for a discussion with officials is perhaps overly formal and procedural, but her trust in Ní Raghallaigh had been much depleted by that stage  and it’s credible  that she wanted to cover herself and avoid further ambiguities. Key  questions in the whole saga are,  at what point did  the department know  of the board’s approval for Collins’s exit package, and what did they  do with the information? On February 22nd, Ní Raghallaigh reminded them that she had communicated the board’s involvement in a phone call at the time the package was agreed last October – she has been absolutely firm on this point. But Martin – and the department – say she merely indicated that she “imagined” this is what she would have said. Ní Raghallaigh has taken particular issue with this, saying her use of the word “imagined” was in reference to what the department’s then secretary general Katherine Licken told the Minister following this call, not what she recalled about her message to the department about the board’s involvement. Her statement on Monday is clear on this: “I explained this when asked on Thursday, February 22nd and, when pressed, I conceded that I couldn’t possibly know if the detail of my conversation with the secretary general was passed on to the Minister, as I was not a party to that conversation, but that I would imagine that it had. “A different construction is now being put on that, my use of the word ‘imagine’ is now being misrepresented.” This matters, because it suggests the chair was effectively forced out for failing to remember correctly information that already resided within the department. But the note fails to shed any real new light on this. It merely restates what Martin told the committee: the department’s version, which is that Ní Raghallaigh “imagined that she would have also referred to the role of the remuneration committee in that conversation”. One of the most damaging allegations laid at Martin’s door in her statement on Monday was that the Green Party deputy leader was a “hands-off” minister when it came to the RTÉ crisis. The main evidence for this was how frequently she met – or did not meet – with Ní Raghallaigh. Martin had told the media committee that her main line of communication was through Ní Raghallaigh, and gave the impression of having a fair degree of contact. Not so, said the former RTÉ  chair – it was “not true” to claim there were formal or scheduled meetings,  and that there were “only a handful of meetings directly with the Minister”. Instead, she said, the main line of communication was with officials. Martin’s letter to committee chair Niamh Smyth sketches out a total of 15 meetings. However, they do show two periods where meetings were infrequent – a seven-week stretch across July and August (when Martin has said she suffered a bereavement), and a second period between November 9th last and January 23rd. On the face of it, this would seem to undermine Ní Raghallaigh’s contention – but  Ní Raghallaigh is unlikely to be heard from again on the matter, including on what type of meetings they were and what stock she put in them, or what she meant by direct meetings. This is likely to remain a point of divergence. The committee, somewhat surprisingly, did not seek documentation relating to a key period: October 9th and 10th. This is when Ní Raghallaigh says she fully briefed the department; the department says it did not receive vital details about board sign-off. Martin has previously said no note exists of the crucial phone call between her then secretary general and the RTÉ chair, but if more records exist around this time within the department, they may shed further light on this key issue.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.6204434375416948,False
"Legislation needed to guarantee implementation of new autism strategy, Dáil told  Oireachtas committee report makes 109 recommendations which TD Pauline Tully says must be acted on Legislation is essential to guarantee the implementation of the new autism strategy into the future, the Dáil has been warned. Sinn Féin spokeswoman on disability Pauline Tully welcomed the promised publication of a new strategy, to be published in early April, but insisted it was crucial that new laws are in place to ensure it is acted on. The Cavan-Monaghan TD was opening a Dáil debate on the final report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Autism. It makes 109 recommendations, all of which Ms Tully said must be implemented as soon as possible. The report calls for legislation requiring the State to publish a strategy and review it every three years and obliging the minister for disabilities to update the Dáil and Seanad annually. It also calls on the Government to establish a committee or monitoring group between autistic people to participate in drafting long-term protections, and for mandatory autism training for health and social care staff. The autistic community in Ireland “have been repeatedly let down by the State and many autistic people and their families wonder whether they can trust that services will ever improve”, and the legislation would “go someway to rebuilt that trust” with the provision of services “which are so desperately needed”. Ms Tully highlighted the “shocking evidence” the committee heard from those with autism and healthcare professionals about the inadequate provision of healthcare and mental health supports. Recommendations also included a call for the establishment of a “single, clear entry point to children’s disability services”. Ms Tully said this was essential because at present autistic children are passed between services. Several witnesses told the committee that Camhs (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service) “refuses to work with children who have a primary diagnosis of autism on the basis that Camhs’ services are unsuitable for them”. She pointed out that the life expectancy of autistic people is potentially reduced by 16 to 30 years while the risk of suicide is seven times higher among autistic people than in the general population. Minister of State for Disability Anne Rabbitte confirmed that a new strategy on autism will be published in the first week of April and the autistic community is involved in all stages of its development process. Ms Rabbitte said the strategy will lay the foundations of ensuring it is “part of mainstream service delivery”. She told TDs that “it will not fix everything by itself but it will deliver tangible result in the short to medium term and provide the building blocks for a more autism-friendly service in the longer term”. But the Minister warned against creating “a perceived hierarchy of disabilities” in addressing the bespoke challenges and barriers facing those with autism. She said many of the issues they face also affect other persons with disabilities. Ms Rabbitte said there had been 300 responses to a public consultation and she pointed to an increased budget of €25 million a year for respite services to ensure they expand across the country. Addressing the challenges in recruitment and retention of staff the Minister said 662 new full-time staff were recruited last year compared to 231 the year before. There had also been an 8 per cent pay increase for Section 39 employees. The Education and Training Board has created 250 training places for assistant therapist roles, up from 125 last year for speech and language. Chairman of the committee Fine Gael TD Micheál Carrigy welcomed the work done to date to improve services but he said the committee heard evidence from many witnesses suggesting issues affecting services and supports for the autistic community “cannot be resolved in the lifetime of a single strategy”. Many ask if they can trust that future governments will continue the work of Minister Rabbitte and the new strategy. “It must be borne in mind that much of the progress which has been achieved to date in respect of ensuring the services for autistic people are on the agenda, is due to the hard work of autistic self-advocates and the families of autistic young people.” Mr Carrigy said it would be “bitterly disappointing for the community and their loved ones if we did not grasp the opportunity to give a statutory basis to the strategy to ensure that the rights of autistic people are not neglected in the future”.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air.

Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances?

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.7803402888856913,False
"‘An attack on our democracy’: Minister says intimidation of politicians drives more people away Heather Humphreys said the scenes of people outside Roderic O’Gorman’s home were unacceptable The Minister for Community and Rural Development, Heather Humphreys, says that people are being driven out of politics because of increased incidents of intimidation and harassment. The Minister was speaking in Galway today where she unveiled a €30 million investment in 12 different community centres across the country. She described the incident which took place outside the house of Minister for Integration, Roderic O’Gorman on Thursday last as “absolutely disgusting” and said it was an attack on democracy and an attack on the people. “It is very concerning to see what happened to Roderic O’Gorman’s house. I was absolutely disgusted to think that people could take the time and effort to do such things, it is awful. To see those despicable posters put up, I totally, totally condemn it,” she said. “I welcome the fact that the Minister for Justice [Helen McEntee] is speaking to the Garda Commissioner [Drew Harris] about the issue. “It does put people off getting involved in politics. No doubt about it, nobody wants this. Whatever about the candidate themselves, I put myself up for politics and I accept that I am going to get criticism, but it is not right to go to your home and put your family in it. They didn’t put themselves up for election, people should remember that. “There is a right to protest, everyone accepts that, everyone acknowledges that, but there is a place that people should not be going and that is to people’s homes.” Ms Humphrey’s said that any attack on elected representatives amounts to an attack on the people who elected them. “This is going to be investigated by the gardaí. We will have to see the outcome of that and I don’t want to say anything that would prejudice any investigation,” she said. “But this is not just the politicians. I think everyone needs to be aware that if someone puts their name forward and is elected, they are the people’s representative. We are there to represent the people. “If you are going to attack those who put their names forward, those who get elected, those who have the honour of holding a high office, then that ultimately is an attack on our democracy. It is an attack on the people who sent their representatives to our national parliament.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits?

"‘Showboating and grandstanding’: Green Party’s new senator says Stormont engaged in acts of ‘symbolism’  Mal O’Hara said the Sinn Féin and DUP ‘joint First Ministers’ were involved in ‘carefully choreographed photo shoots’ The restored Northern Ireland Executive has been accused of failing to do more than engage in acts of “symbolism”. The Green Party’s new Senator Mal O’Hara said the Sinn Féin and DUP “joint First Ministers” were involved in “carefully choreographed photo shoots, picking the lowest of low hanging fruit”. Mr O’Hara, who is the party’s leader in Northern Ireland, said symbolism is important in the North and shows the journey towards reconciliation. “But is a Sinn Féin First Minister standing for God Save the King and her DUP Deputy attending a GAA game the best we can do 26 years after the Good Friday Agreement?” Addressing the Green Party national conference in Dublin, he claimed the Assembly merely debated non-binding motions. There is “no programme for government, no legislative agenda” the public finances are “perilous”, one in four people are on a health waiting list, one in 34 are homeless, and public services are at breaking point. But the Assembly only debates “a repeated series of non-binding motions. That’s not representative democracy. That’s showboating and grandstanding.” He told delegates the Belfast Agreement promised peace, prosperity and reconciliation but “the areas of the North that were amongst the poorest in 1998 in western Europe remain so 26 years later”. Describing Northern Ireland as “traumatised” with intergenerational trauma, he said “we spend less per head than any other part of the UK on mental health and wellbeing, we have the greatest levels of endemic poverty and our drug deaths amongst men aged 25-40 is the highest in Europe bar Scotland”. And he told delegates that an anti-poverty strategy promised and mandated since 2007 has not yet been delivered. “Northern Ireland remains the poorest part of these islands. We have still not made the journey we all hoped for on reconciliation. Still so many of our schools and housings estates remain segregated and less than 10 per cent of our schools are integrated.” Mr O’Hara is a former Belfast City councillor who lost his seat in last year’s local elections. While the party currently has five councillors in the North it also lost its two Assembly seats in the 2022 election. “It’s been a bruising couple of years for us,” Mr O’Hara said, urging party members to get out and canvass for local candidates as he pointed out that he lost his Assembly seat by 50 votes. Earlier this month he was elected unopposed as a Senator in a by-election following the decision of former Sinn Féin senator Niall Ó Donnghaile to stand down for health reasons. Mr O’Hara said Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald had described his predecessor as a great voice for Northern nationalists and he wanted to build on that foundation. But since the agreement was signed in 1998 there had been “crisis and collapse” and since its return in February, there has been the “same old approach” despite a promise that “it’s different this time”. The Executive he said, “refuses to discuss revenue raising and bemoans the state of public finances, all the while looking to the British government for additional finance. While austerity, a disinterested Tory government and historic underfunding plays a significant part, surely there is some culpability for those who have been in power on and off for 26 years?” Local authorities in the North should have devolved powers, he said but despite the Greens calling for this “another all-island party voted it down – happy to control transport powers in Limerick, Cork and Dublin with Greens but unwilling to do so in Belfast. Is that a partitionist approach?” On environmental issues he said the North had the highest emissions per capita in these islands, and ranked 12th worst in the world for biodiversity loss. “None of our 496 rivers, lakes and coastal waters meet a good standard and we have the biggest illegal dump in western Europe and there is no independent investigation despite the Assembly supporting one.” Mr O’Hara, who took his seat in the Seanad last week, also warned that the Greens had ignored the constitutional question for too long and had paid the price. Pointing to the German Greens he said they were nearly annihilated in the 1990s because they were talking about the ozone while everyone else was focused on unification.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.42547406103529256,False
"Coalition nervous about getting approval for EU migration pact Expectation is Dáil and Seanad will vote in favour of opting into the pact, but volatility of views on immigration issues means outcome is far from certain   The Government’s decision to opt into a new EU migration pact, due to take effect in 2026, is the latest test of the Coalition’s capacity to achieve its policy goals against a backdrop that is more volatile – especially on immigration issues. While there is, as yet, no credible suggestion that it would lose Dáil and Seanad votes planned next week to approve its decision – and no hint of a U-turn – there is a “nervousness” around, in the words of one Coalition source, due to a “lack of trust evident everywhere”. In a nutshell, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has argued that the pact strengthens Ireland and Europe’s hand when it comes to dealing with growing migration and irons out uneven edges in the current system that are not in the State’s favour. She says it will result in a firmer, fairer system that will reduce time spent in State-provided accommodation and return those who do not have a right to asylum. Sinn Féin has emphasised “sovereignty” in calling for its rejection while arguing “many decisions are better taken locally”. The problem for the Government is that, similar to the hate speech legislation and the family and care referendums, opposition to the pact is proving to be a rallying point across the political spectrum. Within the sprawling text of the pact, there is something there for all sides to oppose. On the left, there are concerns about the use of detention and the expansion of fingerprinting to all asylum seekers aged six and above. The Irish Refugee Council wrote to the Justice Committee last week warning that the reforms will “result in less safeguards, increased detention and destitution among people seeking protection”. The IRC says that the pact began with good intentions that have been “gradually eroded by various member states’ hardening positions”, arguing that change is indeed needed “but not at any price”. Meanwhile, on the right, the pact is being portrayed as an unwelcome intrusion from Brussels on the red-button issue of migration. Michael McDowell, flush with the success of emerging as the champion of the No side in the family and care referendums, has strongly objected to the parliamentary scrutiny afforded to the decision. “He has become the trusted uncle on everything now,” says one Coalition insider with a sigh. Take, for example, the mandatory solidarity mechanism, which would allocate a number of asylum seekers to each member state in order to relieve pressure on those who act as entry points to the bloc (and, sources say, to discourage them from simply allowing migrants to transit through their countries onwards). This has conjured all sorts of fears as one of the determinants of a state’s fair share is GDP, and Ireland’s is inflated beyond reference to the real economy due to the distorting effect of the multinational sector. However, McEntee suggests that in reality, the impact of this will be quite muted – on current figures, some 648 relocations annually. Not a tiny number, but in the context of an anticipated 15,000 arrivals per year, not a game changer. Buying our way out of this would cost just south of €13 million; compared with the billions being spent accommodating refugees and asylum seekers already, that doesn’t come close to moving the dial. Part of the nervousness in Government stems from a conviction that now is the time to act on migration while at least a broad consensus has been achieved in Europe – after European elections, a new parliament and a new commission may swing in a new direction, or away from cohesive reforms. Expert bodies, including the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), say that international co-operation is key to managing the movement of refugees. “The agreement reached on the pact represents significant progress towards a more coherent, co-ordinated and effective EU response to migration and asylum,” says Enda O’Neill, head of the UNHCR in Dublin – while adding that “more work remains to be done to plan for its implementation”. In truth, the Government doesn’t have to win the argument in the way it spectacularly failed to do in the referendum campaigns. But it will want to guard its majority as the opposition probes for weakness. Any sign of discontent from the Independent TDs who tend to vote with the Coalition will be noteworthy, as will evidence of unrest on the backbenches.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,False
"Fewer than 100 deportations of those refused refugee status since start of 2023 – McEntee Minister for Justice said timeframe for deportation had been improving, despite elongated appeals process Fewer than 100 of the 7,300 people refused refugee status since the beginning of 2023 have been deported, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s News at One, Ms McEntee said that level of deportations was a higher proportion than the rest of Europe. “We have really improved our time frames over the last number of years. You could have had people in the system for six or seven or eight years. We’re now down to probably, the maximum around two years for many of the ordinary decisions. “For those who are in accelerated procedures, their first decisions are within about 60 days. But we still have elongated appeals processes,” she said. Ms McEntee on Tuesday told the Oireachtas justice committee that more than 80 per cent of migrants are now arriving in the State via Northern Ireland, according to her estimates. She said there is a returns agreement to send those back to the UK who have refugee status there, although that has been impeded by a recent High Court judgment which she is bringing forward legislation to remedy. The Minister pointed out that since the “safe countries” system was introduced last year, about 80 per cent of appeals received negative decisions. “What we’re going to start to see now, particularly with the faster processing, is that it will be much easier to remove people, but also they’ll be removed much more quickly. “So you have to remember that we are completely overhauling the system that has for years taken years to actually even get to a deportation. So we’re trying to shorten that.” The Government this month opted in to an EU-wide migration pact, a wide-ranging deal which would introduce some standard practices across European states. The pact envisions speedier decisions on migrants who arrive in any EU state, with a first decision made within three months. It would also include a solidarity mechanism by which Ireland may be obliged to accommodate a proportion of those applicants arriving in countries experiencing greater inflows, or to pay a cash sum toward the processing of such cases in situ. When asked about the number of appeals from people who had been refused refugee status, Ms McEntee said she did not have any appeals before her at present. “I have not signed off on any appeals or refused or rejected any in the last year at least. I know we have a lengthy process. And this is why the pact is so important here. “This is why it’s important for people to understand what we would be bound by are changes that would reduce the time frame.”",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants.

Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,False
"‘Blatantly unfair’ that Social Democrat candidates are excluded from RTÉ election debates, says Cairns Party leader to complain to State broadcaster over omission of Rory Hearne and Susan Doyle from televised European vote debates It is “blatantly unfair” that Social Democrat candidates will not be included in two RTÉ television debates for the European elections, party leader Holly Cairns has said. She told reporters on Wednesday that the party will be writing to the State broadcaster to complain that Rory Hearne and Susan Doyle will not be included in debates for the Midlands Northwest and Ireland South constituencies. Separately, Ms Cairns said her party’s policy of using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) was under review, and was introduced by “a previous person in a senior position in the party”. She said the practice, which emerged at the weekend, was to ensure the party’s obligations to “protect people’s very private, often personal information” and they had “no intention of suing anybody”. The Cork Southwest TD was speaking in Dublin, as her party launched its local and European election campaigns. Ms Cairns queried RTÉ's criteria for TV debates and said the impact such debates could have on an election campaign was “huge”, while her party’s mandate had grown over recent years. Ms Cairns also said that it was “entirely appropriate” that an extraordinary meeting of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) was held after chief commissioner Sinéad Gibney announced she was stepping down earlier this year to seek the Social Democrats’ nomination to run in the European elections. Ms Gibney is standing in the Dublin constituency. The Irish Times reported on Wednesday that records from the IHREC showed Ms Gibney’s departure to run for Europe sparked internal fears about the risk of a perception of “politicisation” or conflict of interest. Internal minutes showed that an extraordinary meeting of the commission held after Ms Gibney’s announcement was told members of the IHREC executive had expressed “concerns ... regarding the perceived risk to IHREC’s independence”. Responding to the report, Ms Cairns said: “I think it’s entirely appropriate that the commission would have had the meeting that was reported in The Irish Times and we know that after that steps were taken by Sinéad and the Commission in conjunction, to make sure that it was done in the right way, that there was a smooth transition. “Sinéad stepped back from multiple duties like making decisions on legal matters, chairing meetings at a number of other things, to ensure that she could protect the reputation of the organisation and they did that really effectively together. I think it’s entirely appropriate that meeting would have happened.” Ms Cairns said local election candidate Orli Degani, a Jewish woman with Israeli citizenship, was deselected by the party for Dún Laoghaire local electoral area (LEA) in the forthcoming elections because of a differing position on Gaza. Ms Degani is now running as an independent candidate. “Fundamentally, our policy position on Gaza differed, especially with regard to boycott divestment settlements and there were objections to our members attending rallies,” Ms Cairns said. “We had a very long and fair process where the national executive were involved and we engaged a mediator, she [Ms Delgani] had a right to appeal that decision and she didn’t, but we wish her well in the future.” The Social Democrats leader also said she didn’t think the deselection would hurt the party in the upcoming elections and that people understood that sometimes candidates needed to be deselected, which was “a very difficult process”. “Nobody wants that to happen. But there’s a time and a place for that and as long as the process is fair, I think people are happy,” she said.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.53702475842554,False
"Green Party councillor attacked while hanging posters in Dublin Janet Horner was putting up election posters on North Circular Road when attacked on same day as assault on Independent councillor and husband in Hartstown A Green Party councillor has told of how she was hit and threatened while out canvassing and hanging posters in Dublin for the forthcoming local elections. Janet Horner, a Green Party representative of  the north inner city on Dublin City Council, said she was  canvassing on the North Circular Road last week when she was approached by an irate man who threw her posters across the road and lunged at her when she tried to stop him. “He was roaring, he was very confrontational. He was saying ‘We don’t want your Green Party s***e around here, Dublin 1 is for the far-right’,” said Ms Horner. “He said ‘I’m going to kill you. I’m going to kill you.’ At this stage it was dark and I don’t think he fully realised that he was talking to the person whose face was on the poster, but it may have dawned on him as he was shouting,” she told The Irish Times. Ms Horner said she had been holding a ladder at this point, as a colleague was scaling it to attach a poster to the lamppost. “He was in that state of mind, I knew he was willing to hurt us. He grabbed the poster then and threw it onto the road, and then someone he knew came along. I was too panicked to hear what they were saying to each other because in that moment I was terrified. I thought we were going to be outnumbered.” She said she will continue to canvass as she believes it is important for politicians to continue knocking door-to-door in their communities, and she highlighted the abuse that some of her constituents from diverse backgrounds also receive. Ms Horner made a statement to gardaí after the incident, and  wrote to Minister for Justice Helen McEntee calling for a system of monitoring such attacks and for a point of contact with designated gardaí for elected representatives. It comes amid a recent spate of attacks on councillors ahead of June’s local elections. A Dublin councillor last weekend spoke about how she was punched in the head while her husband was beaten because she did not hold anti-immigration views. Independent councillor Tania Doyle said she feared that she and her husband would be killed in the violent, unprovoked attack which took place in Hartstown, Dublin, on the same day Ms Horner was attacked. On Wednesday, the Oireachtas launched a report by the taskforce on safety in political life,  chaired by former Garda commissioner Noirin O’Sullivan. The report found that abuse in political life is prevalent and  disproportionately targeted at women or minority groups. It was accompanied by a study conducted by UCD which found that 94 per cent of TDs and Senators and 72 per cent of political staff had experienced some form of threat, harassment, abuse or violence. Asked about  participation by social media companies in the taskforce’s work, Ms O’Sullivan said it was “very regrettable” that the platform X, formerly Twitter, “was not in a position” to engage and that the company had said it was “unavailable” when contacted. Asked whether there was a chance of an elected representative being attacked or killed in Ireland, as had taken place in the UK, Ms O’Sullivan said that “all of us collectively have to stand together and face down the threat and the risk”. The taskforce’s report made a number of recommendations, including establishing an engagement forum with social media companies and gardaí and introducing a social media monitoring service for politicians and their staff. Ms O’Sullivan said “trusted flaggers” could monitor inflammatory content.",-1,-1_northern_uk_dup_stormont,"['northern', 'uk', 'dup', 'stormont', 'posters', 'north', 'return', 'election', 'new', 'dáil']","['Irish unity in ‘touching distance’ after DUP vote, says McDonald Recall of the Assembly to elect Speaker could take place as early as Saturday Irish unity is within “touching distance” as a nationalist First Minister at Stormont is poised to come into office for the first time, according to Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Reacting to the DUP’s endorsement of a deal with the UK government that will end its two-year boycott of the powersharing Executive, Ms McDonald said the elevation of party vice-president Michelle O’Neill to the head of the North’s devolved government will be a moment of “very great significance”. The recall of the Assembly to elect a Speaker could take place as early as Saturday and DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson signalled on Tuesday his optimism that there are enough concessions to show that the “naysayers are wrong”. The deal is due to be published on Wednesday and Ms O’Neill said the next number of days are crucial to get the powersharing institutions up and running. Addressing media at Stormont, Ms McDonald alluded to previous political arrangements in Northern Ireland, saying: “I think a Sinn Féin First Minister, and Michelle coming into office as First Minister, for all really is the most striking evidence that that era is now gone; it is now consigned to the pages of the history books. “And more importantly it signals now the new Ireland emerging and the conversation around a new constitutional dispensation, ending partition, Irish unity, all of the opportunity that presents is in many ways embodied in this moment of Michelle O’Neill becoming First Minister here.” Ms McDonald added “I think that the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. And I think that’s a very exciting thing.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 when its former first minister Paul Givan quit the executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Donaldson admitted on Tuesday that they had not secured “everything” they had sought from London in relation to changes to the Windsor Framework deal struck between UK and EU last year. However, he said he had achieved a “good outcome for Northern Ireland” and pledged “zero” checks on goods and paperwork works destined for the North - through the “green lane” element of the Windsor Framework – from Britain. “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told reporters outside Stormont. Asked about a timeline for Stormont’s return, he said it was conditional upon the UK government “delivering on their side” but that he hoped it will happen quickly. DUP party discipline remained tight on Tuesday after Monday evening’s DUP executive meeting led to an internal party inquiry when details of Mr Donaldson’s briefing to 130 members were leaked by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Bryson live tweeted details in what he claimed was a “blow by blow account” of the five-hour meeting. Despite Mr Donaldson’s claims on Tuesday that there will be legal changes to the post-Brexit deal, Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris played down the prospect of fresh negotiations with the EU and said that “all conditions are now in place” for a return of the Executive. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was adamant that the Windsor Framework deal will not be changed “one sentence” and that the so-called Irish Sea Border will “still be there”. Mr Beattie expressed concern that the situation could “unravel” in coming days if the Assembly is not restored by Monday. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long told reporters it was a “bittersweet” day in that there was nothing in the DUP deal with the UK that “wasn’t available in 2018 under Theresa May”.', 'UK government publishes deal which will set stage for Stormont return Safeguarding the Union document was released online by the UK government on Wednesday  The text of the legislation which secured the DUP’s return to power-sharing in the North has been published. The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was released online by the UK government on Wednesday afternoon. The measures outlined in the document by the UK government include, as previously signalled, legislation “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the Union” and which amends the UK Internal Market Act 2020 to “guarantee Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the UK’s internal market.” It will also end dynamic alignment with EU law. Legislative change will “recognise the end of the automatic pipeline of EU law”; Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will be amended, “reflecting the new reality that the law which applies in Northern Ireland is now properly subject to the democratic oversight of the Northern Ireland Assembly through the Stormont Brake and the democratic consent mechanism.” The so-called Green Lane will be replaced with a UK internal market system, and the UK government “will commit that more than 80 per cent of all freight movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland take place under the UK internal market system, with independent scrutiny.” This will ensure “there will be no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks.” There will be a legal requirement that new legislation will be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, if so, for ministers to make a statement considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.” The document includes more than 20 provisions, which includes the creation of an Independent Monitoring Panel to “provide oversight of the implementation of new arrangements”, the creation of a UK East-West Council and the publication of operational arrangements for the Stormont Brake. The UK government will also “pursue an agreement with the EU on a long-term basis” to ensure the continued supply of necessary veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland beyond 2025. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said  before it was published that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. His party has been using a veto power to block Stormont’s devolved institutions for almost two years in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, Mr Donaldson announced earlier this week that his party was prepared to return to Stormont, dependent on the UK government implementing the various legislative assurances and other measures it has offered. This is expected to lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland within days and will see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill become the North’s first ever nationalist first minister. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return,” he said on Tuesday. The return of Stormont will also see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland. The financial package includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Mr Donaldson said the deal would represent a “significant change” in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit’s so-called Irish Sea border. He said: “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. “On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.” Sinn Féin has focused on the imminent return of the Stormont Assembly, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald stating that Irish unity is now within “touching distance” as she hailed the significance of her party assuming the role of Stormont first minister for the first time. Ms McDonald said the expected appointment of Ms O’Neill in the coming days would be a moment of “very great significance”. Mr Donaldson announced his support for a Stormont return after receiving the “decisive” backing of the 130-strong party executive during a five-hour meeting on Monday night. He said DUP party officers, a key 12-strong decision-making body, had also “mandated” him to move forward on the basis he was proposing. Support for the deal is not unanimous within the DUP and several senior figures remain opposed to the proposed agreement. - PA', 'Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024. In years to come, much will be made of the significance of this day. It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,False
"Woman who waited 12 hours for emergency surgery described Galway hospital as ‘warzone’ Tánaiste says he is ‘mystified’ at recruitment embargo as 28,000 people have been brought in to health service since 2020 A woman who waited 12 hours before she underwent emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy sometimes cannot believe she is still alive after her “warzone” experience in University Hospital Galway, the Dáil was told. Sinn Féin TD Mairéad Farrell raised the case of “Niamh” as she warned “in the last three years the overcrowding alert was activated more times than any other hospital”. She said that Niamh presented at the overcrowded emergency department (ED) with intense stomach pain, waiting over an hour to be triaged and five hours before she finally saw a doctor and another seven hours before she had emergency surgery. The incident happened last month. “She felt the doctor was so rushed that he wasn’t taking in what she was saying,” returning afterwards to the “warzone” waiting area. She provided a urine sample when she was asked to leave on a counter for collection but it was still there two hours later. When eventually the results came back they showed elevated white cells and a suspected infection and she was prescribed an antibiotic and a pain drug. “As it was being administered, the nurse came rushing back in panic and shouted, ‘you are pregnant. You can’t be on this painkiller when you’re pregnant.’ Ms Farrell said panic followed about how much she had been given before seven hours after she arrived she was referred to a gynaecologist. “It was only then that the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy was raised.” Niamh needed an emergency scan but she only got that more than eight hours after arriving. “The scan showed nothing but blood in her uterus and Niamh’s emergency surgery wouldn’t happen until 6:45pm, 12 hours after she first presented.” The surgery took three hours and not the planned 1.5 hours because of significant internal bleeding. “Sometimes Niamh can’t believe she survived,” the Galway West TD said. “She kept thinking what’s going to happen to my baby so if I don’t survive? It was deeply traumatising.” Niamh said the hospital was not able to handle the number of patients at 6 am when she arrived. Ms Farrell said she told her “I’m lucky I went in early in the morning. If I’d gone later, I don’t know if I’d still be here.” “The hospital was clearly understaffed. The workers were run off their feet. They’re clearly wasn’t enough beds,” she said, adding that the stories such as Niamh’s were the reason the Government’s recruitment embargo was so dangerous. And she called for the 1,500 hospital beds still needed to be delivered. Ms Farrell said Niamh wanted to give the Government a message that “people are dying needlessly in our emergency departments” and she could have been one of them. The Tánaiste described Ms Farrell’s description of Niamh’s experience as “shocking in itself”, adding that it was clear she “went through an extraordinary traumatic and horrific journey from arrival to the emergency department and subsequent developments and treatment.” He added that he was “mystified” at the recruitment embargo because 28,000 people have been recruited since 2020 to the health service. He said “there comes a time when you have to look at other factors”. Mr Martin said that “fundamentally the organisation of trauma and emergency departments is key to this”, the “multidisciplinary presences in emergency department is key, with proper rostering of emergency departments in terms of consultant presence”. He added: “I think it raises many issues, more than just resources and more than just the embargo, quite frankly, because the numbers have increased substantially.”",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.6074473956934957,False
"Warring neighbours would have a new avenue to complain about overgrown trees under proposed law Sinn Féin Bill which would give local authorities role in mediating and adjudicating on disputes progresses to next stage in Oireachtas  Local authorities would get a new role mediating and adjudicating on disputes between neighbours arguing about overgrown trees and hedges under proposals that are proceeding to the next stage in the Oireachtas. Sinn Féin’s Neighbours Disputes (Vegetation Bill), which was first drafted in 2017, is proceeding to committee stage in the Dáil after the Government agreed not to oppose the legislation. Aengus Ó Snodaigh, the Sinn Féin TD behind the legislation, said it is aimed at avoiding neighbours going to court in disputes about overgrown trees. He said that there is currently no other recourse in such rows and while people are entitled to cut back parts of trees overhanging their gardens this can undermine the tree or make it dangerous. He told the Dáil there are “a lot more important and pressing issues” but added: “if you’re somebody who has a tree that is growing from 20ft when you moved in first, and all of a sudden it’s 60ft high and the woman next door is a pensioner who doesn’t have the wherewithal to cut back that tree, what is your recourse? “You can bring her to court and you can force it but that isn’t what neighbours are meant to be.” He said the legislation is similar to the system in England and it would put the onus on local authorities to have a mediation role to help resolve such disputes. Minister of State in Department of Health Mary Butler, representing the Government side in the Dáil, told Mr Ó Snodaigh: “I think what you’re proposing is a common-sense approach”. The Waterford TD said there is “no doubt but that disputes can be incredibly difficult and stressful” for those involved. The Bill proposes a formal solution to such issues and is, therefore, well-intentioned. For that reason, the Government has agreed in principle not to oppose the Bill,” she said. Ms Butler said a separate Mediation Act came into force in 2018 and there are a number of mediation options, some free and some fee-based, open to people seeking to resolve disputes with neighbours. Ms Butler  said there was “no adjudicative element envisaged in the Mediation Act so the assignment of such a function to local authorities would be entirely new”. She said this would require “careful consideration from a civil law viewpoint”. She said consideration would also have to be given to civil and property rights implications of the Bill and the staff and financial resources implications for local authorities. Mr Ó Snodaigh said he expects to find out this week which Oireachtas Committee the legislation will be referred to. He expressed scepticism as to whether the Bill could be further debated and ultimately enacted before the next general election if it is assigned to either the Housing and Local Government or Justice committees, given their respective workloads. “Even if it’s not passed in this Dáil I have the option then in the next Dáil to bring it back at the same stage,” he said. “I intend to pursue it.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Ireland supports EU entry talks for Ukraine starting next month Government move to recognise state of Palestine remains ‘imminent’, Jennifer Carroll MacNeill says Ireland would support a move to formally kick off negotiations with Ukraine about the country joining the European Union, which is expected to be discussed when national leaders meet next month, Minister of State for European affairs Jennifer Carroll MacNeill has said. Late last year EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, one of the initial steps on the long road towards membership. A proposal to give the go ahead for those membership talks to formally begin is being drawn up by diplomats, with reports that it may be on the agenda when the 27 EU leaders meet for a summit at the end of June. Speaking on Tuesday, Ms Carroll MacNeill said the Government would like to see the process given the green light to move to the next stage at that summit meeting. “Ireland has been one of the earliest supporters of Ukrainian and indeed Moldovan accession and we would like to see that happen as soon as possible,” she said. “There’s quite a body of work to do over the next number of weeks to get to that point, but Ireland is absolutely firmly behind that,” she said. The Fine Gael junior minister said there should be a particular focus on pushing ahead with talks about Ukraine joining the EU, given the war it was waging with Russia. There is a push to sign off on the formal start of the talks before Hungary takes over the rotating presidency of the council of the EU, a deal making role the country is due to assume for six months on July 1st. There is concern progress could be stalled during the second half of the year, given Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban has been resistant to Ukraine joining the EU. Separately, Ms Carroll MacNeill said the recognition of the state of Palestine by Ireland and a number of other countries, such as Spain, was “very imminent”. The Government was still planning to take the decision by the end of this month, she said. “Whether it is today, tomorrow, or this day next week, really what’s important is the substance of what we’re trying to do here … It will be very very soon,” she said. “What we have been trying to do all along is co-ordinate as best we can, with other countries that would take a similar view,” she said. The junior minister said the group of countries who were discussing the plans wanted to “make the biggest statement possible,” she said. Ms Carroll MacNeill was speaking in Brussels on her way into a meeting of EU ministers.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.6622872725058613,False
"Interdepartmental group to be created to consider right to housing referendum Leaked commission report recommends executive body to direct housing delivery, but Minister does not want ‘additional layers’ An interdepartmental group will be set up to consider plans to hold a referendum on the right to housing, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has confirmed. The existing Housing Commission was tasked with making a recommendation to Government on a proposed referendum on housing. The process was derailed by internal division, however, with a minority report now enjoying the support of three members. The Irish Times revealed on Tuesday that the report is mute on what happens next. Now, an intergovernmental group will be established to move the process on. The group will develop policy recommendations, and the advice of the attorney general will also be sought. “There is much more work to be done and the work published today will contribute to a robust and informed policy debate and will certainly inform the direction of housing strategy into the future,” Mr O’Brien said. Mr O’Brien said on Wednesday that he does not want to install an executive body that would sit across all Government and agencies to direct housing delivery, as recommended by the Housing Commission report that was leaked on Tuesday. “I think that in itself would be problematic. I don’t want to add additional layers on housing delivery,” he said. According to Mr O’Brien, the commission spent three years working on this report and he has only had it for 14 days to review it. He had wanted to give it “due consideration” before it was released and would have published the report when it had been “examined in full” if it had not been leaked, he said. Mr O’Brien noted the report was independent of him. He received approval from Cabinet to release the report before it was leaked on Tuesday and will release the document later on Wednesday. The report itself has over 83 recommendations. “Many of those are done or being done,” said Mr O’Brien. “One example such as the 20 per cent provision for social and affordable housing we’ve actually done already. Forty per cent of the homes we delivered last year were State backed, and I’ve changed the legislation to revert to 20 per cent social and affordable, that’s just one example of many. “Another one I picked up was using equity schemes to help first-time buyers. Again, we’ve kind of done that and that’s been really significant. Just short of 10,000 are now registered for the scheme.” Regarding the Housing Commission report’s recommendation to introduce laws to protect social housing from privatisation he said: “I’ve always been very clear that social housing stock, I want to keep in stock. “We don’t sell many social homes. There’s still a tenant-purchase scheme that’s there. I’ve always been focused on increasing our social housing stock which we’ve done successfully over three years, like last year 12,000 new social homes – that is the highest amount since 1975.” The Housing Commission report recommends the Government should replace Rent Pressure Zones with a new regulatory system and make all rent charges publicly available. The Minister said the Government would “consider this” as part of the Rental Market Review. “We need time to assess the recommendation in more detail. I respect the work that the commission has done, they’ve put a lot of work into it, they’ve given a lot of time and effort into it themselves so it requires due consideration and then I’ll come back in due course to Cabinet on the recommendations to see what we can incorporate,” he said. “Rent Pressure Zones have been an important protection for renters,” said Mr O’Brien. “The previous Government brought them in at 4 per cent rent cap – I reduced that to 2 per cent. Only last week I agreed to extend them into 2025. “We’re concluding our Rental Market Review at the moment that we’ve done in consultation with all stakeholders: NGOs private sectors, investors and renters themselves.” He said all other inputs into the Rental Market Review are being considered and any reasonable recommendations will go into it. “The targeted leasing initiative is actually focused directly on those in emergency accommodation. We also have to look at other avenues. We’re not advancing leasing like we’ve done before, but the targeted long-term leasing initiative is absolutely focused at those in emergency accommodation and that’s about an additional stream of delivery.” “I would much rather that people were in those homes than in emergency accommodation, but leasing is a small part of our overall target, and Housing for All is phasing that out.” Mr O’Brien officially opened 72 new social homes at Dominick Hall on Lower Dominick Street alongside Lord Mayor of Dublin Daithí de Róiste. The Minister described this as a “really good example of some of the excellent regeneration work that is being done in Dublin City Council”, adding: “momentum is there, it’s going in the right direction, progress is there.” Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald was also at the opening ceremony. She described the report as “damning of the Government’s policy”. “It talks about the dysfunctional decision making, the wrong policy approaches, an approach that is too conservative and too slow. We’ve been saying for a long time that we need a radical reset in housing policy and the Government’s own Housing Commission has now confirmed that. “We need a fundamental root-and-branch change. I don’t think this Minister, I don’t think this Government is capable of delivering that change,” she said.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances?

"Minister apologises for HSE’s failure to talk to family of ward of court sent to UK  Fine Gael Senator questions health service structures that allows ‘no oversight, feedback or care plan’ Minister of State for Disability Anne Rabbitte has apologised in the Dáil “for the lack of engagement, communication and consultation” with the family of a 29-year-old man who is a ward of court and was transferred by the HSE to a healthcare facility in the UK 18 months ago. She was responding to Fine Gael Senator Mary Seery Kearney, who raised the case that had “no oversight, feedback or care plan. It seems that because he is 29, a decision has been made that his family does not merit any information.” And that seemed “a most extraordinary situation”. Ms Seery Kearney said the young man was first diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome and then with autism “but only in the last year has also been diagnosed with an intellectual disability”. The family visits their son and brother regularly at St Andrew’s Healthcare in England but the experience “is like going to a prison, given the number of stages they have to go through” before they get to visit him. She said “nobody feels any obligation to tell them anything about their son and brother” and she questioned “the structures within the HSE that would allow such a lack of oversight”. The young man “is very interested in sports but has no access to sport or to watching it on television”, and when the family asks questions, “neither the HSE nor St Andrew’s Healthcare are responding”. The man’s mother “saved money from her wages every week for all of his life” but bank accounts have been frozen. “She cannot access that bank account to buy him a TV.” Ms Seery Kearney said nobody “is liaising with this family and giving them feedback. There appears to be no care plan.” The Senator said the man was told by the HSE that he was going to the UK for two years. “That two-year deadline is coming up shortly and he is obsessed with the idea that he is coming home then but nobody knows anything about it. “He is not in a position to engage with the progress of his care or to know what exactly is happening and he is not getting any feedback. There is no point of contact for the family. They have no idea of the set-up and from a mental health perspective, their view is that he has deteriorated in that time.” Ms Seery Kearney added that the man is in a secure ward “but his preference is to be at home in his own house with his family. That may not be possible. The HSE needs to engage with the family.” The Minister said she did not know the diagnosis and did not know what treatment was being made available. She added that “if the family are watching now or will watch the recording later, I acknowledge their involvement in their son or brother’s care. “I have to apologise for the lack of engagement, communication and consultation with the family,” adding that she would take more details from Ms Seery Kearney afterwards. She said that if there is a timeline on the case and “this young man wants to return home, as is his will and preference, that is what the decision support service is all about”. A framework has been developed “as part of a HSE-wide requirement to ensure that appropriate governance arrangements underpin the release of the funding of agencies”, Ms Rabbitte added. “But to be honest, I hear a lot about the framework, but I do not hear about where the engagement takes place between the various bodies and families.” Describing the case as “extreme” Ms Rabbitte said “it is important that the young man concerned is supported as close to home as possible. Consultation and communication needs to happen.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package.

"Means-testing asylum seekers aims to ensure system is fair, says McEntee Testing to apply to  daily expenses allowances for those in direct provision and international protection settings Government plans to means-test asylum seekers is about ensuring there is a fair system in place, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan.

Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided.

Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,True
"Tensions over refugee housing could be avoided with proper plan, McDonald says Sinn Féin’s 335 candidates can each win a seat in the upcoming local elections, party leader says Tensions over the accommodation of refugees in local communities could largely have been avoided with better “communication or consultation”, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said.

Ms McDonald said the party is “really stretching” itself in running so many candidates but said the size of the team reflects the party’s ambitions. Sinn Féin are running many more candidates than most of the other parties in the local elections. Launching the party’s manifesto in Monaghan on Friday, Ms McDonald said the local and European elections are the first step in getting “this disastrous Government out of office”. Sinn Féin’s local election manifesto pledges include bringing waste collection services back under the control of local councils and providing more childcare spaces though local authority-led childcare facilities. The party promises its councillors will use powers available to them to reduce the local property tax to the lowest possible amount until such time as it is abolished by a Sinn Féin government. The party also pledges that “a strong Sinn Féin team in local government will priorities delivering the biggest public housing programme in the history of the State to meet social and affordable housing need.” Ms McDonald said: “We’re running 335 candidates, each of those candidates can win. That’s the truth of it. I believe that every single one of them has a real chance of being elected. I want every single one of them to be elected. “I do not possess a crystal ball so I cannot give you a definitive figure but I can tell you the candidates we have selected, we have selected to win. It’s a been a big challenge, it is a big challenge for the party because we’re really stretching ourselves here.” While support for Sinn Féin continues to decline in advance of next month’s elections, according to recent polls, the party is confident it can build on its 2020 general election success. “Some 46 per cent of our candidates are women, I’m happy to say. We’re not quite at 50 per cent yet but we’re getting there,” Ms McDonald said. “I’m very conscious going around the country that there is a sense now in many, many communities that they’re not listened to, that they’ve been left behind, that politics represents just more of the same old same. “That’s a bad thing. I think that’s a really unhealthy thing for our politics and our democracy.” – Additional reporting: PA",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.8718939108952023,False
"The psychology of election posters: to smile, frown or go full Mick Wallace? Experts in behavioral psychology examine a selection of posters from the campaign trail to reveal hidden meanings They stare at you from lamp-posts and billboard hoardings, their smiling faces pleading for your Number One. Well, most are smiling – a minority of candidates in the local and European elections go for either a neutral look or something altogether more severe. Such designs are not by accident. Politicians are selling a message, and the imagery, slogans and choice of colours on their posters are part of that. The prominence of the party logo is a factor: Sinn Féin candidates go relatively big, compared, for example, with Labour whose “starry plough” seems like a footnote on Aodhán Ó Ríordáin’s posters. Visuals and props and sometimes added: Ciaran Mullooly is pictured next to some cows on a mobile campaign hoarding, while Bríd Smith puts a Palestinian flag next to the photo. Are there more subtle messages being communicated? The Irish Times sought some expert advice. Belfast-born psychologist Prof Geoff Beattie says he found in his research that “smiling faces were perceived as more attractive, more sociable and more intelligent than non-smiling faces”. The former on-screen analyst for Channel 4′s Big Brother series has just published a new book on Lies, Lying and Liars – serendipitous, some might say, with elections taking place in Ireland and the UK this summer. People will unconsciously judge someone who is smiling “to be more capable”, he says. “Just as long as we don’t perceive him as faking it. We don’t like fakes. It’s a difficult balance.” Prof Vlad Glăveanu, of Dublin City University’s school of psychology, says candidates are walking a “tightrope between appearing competent and being approachable”. “This can lead to some awkward poses and smiles and a tension between engaging viewers directly – through what seems like direct eye contact, for instance – and indirectly: for example, looking elsewhere so they are looked at rather than looking back, which can be assertive without the risk of appearing aggressive.” Glăveanu, who has carried out research on how the mind processes images, says “most elements in an ad aim to communicate something. Colours identify a party and connect to local or national identities”. As for the use of slogans, “we process words and images differently and oftentimes longer messages require more cognitive effort to unpack but can leave a greater mark. This is why three-word slogans can be very popular as they offer the benefit of higher engagement while being easy to remember and pass on ... ‘Take Back Control’ [the Brexit catchcry] comes to mind.” What about some examples from the campaign trail? Glăveanu: “The colours and slogan want to suggest dynamism, confidence, and a longer term perspective – [party leader Holly Cairns] is looking in the distance. The use of the word ‘change’ is emphasised, in the background, by the use of three colour bands and a colour contrast.” Beattie: “Holly is looking away from the camera trying to convey that her smile is more natural and spontaneous, and therefore genuine. She is signifying change by looking away, a break from the traditional fake smile of the politician straight to camera. The pursuit of authenticity and naturalness.” Glăveanu: “Breaks with convention in its visual arrangement and this emphasises the idea of ‘bolder’ from the slogan. The focus on the eyes is meant to suggest closeness and sincerity but the gaze is not direct – the eyes are looked at rather than looking back (a more extreme case is the Mona Lisa) – which is engaging but not threatening.” Beattie: “‘Older and bolder’ reads the message. The wrinkles around the eyes reinforce this message. The marks of experience. ‘We won’t be fooled again,’ is the implicit message. The overall image is a bit like ‘Big Brother is watching you’, but with kinder, sadder eyes. He will act on what he sees. Trust me, look into my eyes.” Glăveanu: “A more traditional political ad with a pose, outfit and smile that are common for this kind of communication. The background, however, is deliberately lively and representative of Dublin, adding dynamism to the image and suggesting national pride.” Beattie: “The smile straight to camera. An attempt to smile with the eyes to make it look more genuine, and an attempt to keep it symmetrical on both sides of the face. An urban modern setting. The message is here is a relaxed, modern man comfortable with the modern world and in control, happy with change.” Glăveanu: “The use of black and white normally adds historicity but in this case there is a contrast established with the youthfulness of the candidate as depicted in the ad, yet another tension that is supposed to catch the viewer’s attention and make them look twice.” Beattie: “A different sort of look and body language for a politician. Pointing at the passerby in almost a confrontational manner. The implicit measure is that I know what goes on, I’m not naive like some politicians. I’m up for the rough stuff, if you just elect me.” Glăveanu: “This ad, expectedly for the Green Party, suggests connections with nature even if the natural background is blurred. The different shades of green, light blue and yellow (including the green earrings) as well as the breeze that gently moves the candidate’s hair are all meant to indicate warmth, confidence, and movement.” Beattie: “No airbrushing here. I’m not going to fake a politician’s smile for the camera. You deserve more than this kind of act. But I’m not looking down on you either. The environment and climate change are the biggest problems we face but we can work together on this. No time for make-up, fakery, or airbrushing. Let’s get to work!” Glăveanu: “This one is atypical as it doesn’t show a candidate but a logo and a slogan. The two hands come together in what resembles a basic prayer emoji and is meant to emphasise the idea of spirituality ... Emotionally charged words like ‘battle’ are being used but, again, the ad lacks dynamism and tries to be solemn rather than vivid while, at the same time, creating a divisive dichotomy between ‘Irish people’ and the unnamed others (the non-Irish and arguably non-Christian) against whom the supposed (spiritual) battle is to be fought.” Beattie: “A different sort of representation. Symbolic ... The hands in prayer. Instantly recognised, instantly decoded. Praying for success in the battle to come.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.26549083792661243,False
"Local elections: What are the main parties promising on housing, immigration and transport? Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin’s manifestos are less detailed than documents put to the electorate in 2020 but may be used to road-test policies before next general election The local election campaign is well and truly under way and the three main parties – Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin – have all published their manifestos filled with promises. In all three cases the local election manifestos are much slimmer and less detailed documents than their general election counterparts which were all more than 100 pages long. For the 2024 local elections, Fianna Fáil’s manifesto runs to 24 pages. Fine Gael and Sinn Féin have 32 pages each. Sinn Féin’s document is in Irish and English so there is just 16 pages of actual content. The shorter lengths probably reflect the vastly more limited powers available to councillors and local authorities. Many of the pledges contained in the manifestos will require the respective parties to be in government nationally after the impending general election for them to be carried out. The local elections are an opportunity to road-test policies with voters in advance of the big vote for Dáil seats. So what are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin promising voters who turn out to choose councillors on June 7th? The housing crisis has long been expected to be the big issue in the upcoming general election. Unsurprisingly all three parties have housing pledges front and centre in their local election manifestos. Fianna Fáil says the party in Government has “got Ireland back building” and claims to have “turned the tide on housing” with its Housing for All plan. Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael promise to build 250,000 homes over the next five years and to extend schemes like Help-to-Buy. In terms of efforts to reduce homelessness, Fianna Fáil promises to “continue to build the largest social housing programme in the history of the State”. Fianna Fáil also says its councillors will not oppose social and affordable housing projects. Fine Gael claims to be “the party that got homebuilding off the ground after the financial crisis”. It also promises to “seek to prevent the bulk purchase of homes” saying the party has already introduced some measures to do this and “we will keep them under active review”. Sinn Féin, meanwhile, as the main Opposition party, argues that after 13 years of Fine Gael in Government “home ownership has collapsed”. The party promises that a “strong Sinn Féin team in local government will prioritise delivering the biggest public housing programme in the history of the State to meet social and affordable housing need”. Sinn Féin claims to be the only party with a plan to deliver such a programme. The party promises its councillors will “use compulsory purchase, where practical, and return to use derelict and vacant properties”. Asked if fulfilling the pledge to delivering the biggest public housing programme in the history of the State required a Sinn Féin government to fulfil given the limited powers of councillors and local authorities Sinn Féin said: “Local authorities have significant powers when it comes to housing and planning, though of course we want Councils with strong Sinn Féin representation working with Sinn Féin in government to ensure the biggest public housing programme in the history of the State is delivered. Electing Sinn Féin councillors is, in fact, key delivering this.” Immigration is also a hot topic on the campaign trail amid an upsurge in anti-immigrant protests in recent times. Fine Gael includes a section specifically on immigration in its local election manifesto. It promises to maintain a migration system that is “firm, fair and enforced”. Fine Gael outlines how the Government is working to increase accommodation places for migrants. The document pledges that Fine Gael will “move away from the emergency use of hotels for housing asylum seekers” though it does not go as far as committing that the practice will end though it intends for this to happen in towns with just one hotel. Fianna Fáil’s manifesto addresses immigration issues in a section entitled “promote thriving communities”. As part of efforts to encourage greater inclusivity, Fianna Fáil says it will “recognise the positive contribution that immigration has on providing good public services” and it will establish local integration forums which will “allow people to safely discuss and have their concerns about immigration addressed”. Somewhat surprisingly given the level of debate on the issue, Sinn Féin does not reference immigration in its local election manifesto. Speaking at the manifesto launch party leader Mary Lou McDonald said Ireland needed an immigration system that was “fair”, “efficient” and “enforced”. Asked about the absence of references to immigration in its local election manifesto Sinn Féin said: “Local authorities have no role in relation to immigration policy, however Sinn Féin believe in an immigration system that is fair, efficient and enforced. It will, of course, feature in our European election manifesto.” Fianna Fáil says it will introduce a dedicated police force for public transport and it will prioritise public safety in towns and cities by boosting funding for crime prevention officers. It promises to strengthen the powers of the local authority to evict tenants for “extreme antisocial behaviour”. Aside from policies like growing Garda numbers, Fine Gael highlights plans to increase penalties for knife crime and strengthen the use of antisocial behaviour orders (Asbos). It also promises to clamp down on the dangerous use of scrambler bikes. Sinn Féin says it will “fight for more gardaí – that are visible and on the beat”. It says it will support the development of relationships between local community gardaí and vulnerable communities among other measures. One tangible power councillors have is to raise and lower Local Property Tax in their areas by as much as 15 per cent either way. Fine Gael promises to maintain councillors’ discretion to decide the rate for their area and says the party “will work at local and national level to detail where your money is being spent”. Sinn Féin says LPT is “regressive” and “outdated” and says its councillors will reduce the tax “to the lowest possible amount in annual council budgets, until such time as it is abolished by a Sinn Féin government”. Fianna Fáil’s document does not mention LPT. Fianna Fáil says it will increase electric vehicle charging points. On road safety it is promising a thorough review of speed limits across the country and expanded traffic calming measures. Fine Gael’s manifesto promises to “work to ensure local authorities have the greatest level of discretion on which roads projects are prioritised and funded”. Sinn Féin says its councillors will prioritise delivering increased funding to ensure local roads are properly maintained.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Migration the one clear difference between Sinn Féin’s last two European election manifestos  Political observers believe the party has hardened its position on migration due to pressure from elements of its voter base When comparing Sinn Féin’s latest European election manifesto with its 2019 offering, one clear difference stands out: migration. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald launched the 2024 document in Dublin on Thursday and fielded several questions from journalists about immigration. Sinn Féin has come under scrunity of late over its position on the issue, with political observers believing it (and also the Government) has hardened its position due to pressure from elements of its voter base. In 2019′s manifesto there was no mention of refugees, asylum seekers or international protection. This time around Sinn Féin outlines its intentions. Firstly, the party calls for a “fair, efficient and enforced migration system” for Ireland. It wants to speed up decisions on asylum applications and enforcement “to ensure the safe return of failed applicants to their country of origin”. It wants to see that EU nationals who are “engaged in serious criminal activity or who pose a risk to public safety here due to their criminal record can be removed to their home country”. The first sign of Sinn Féin toughening its stance on immigration came late last year when McDonald told the Irish Daily Mail it was a mistake to grant Ukrainian refugees special status in Ireland following the Russian invasion. However, she had, during a Dáil debate in March 2022, commended the work done by the Government as new supports specific to Ukrainians were discussed. She doubled down on this thinking on Thursday, saying: “We said from the get-go that just as there shouldn’t be a double standard around how the world views the war in Ukraine and the suffering of the Palestinian people, equally there shouldn’t be a double standard around people who come here seeking refuge wherever they come from.” She added: “I think a lot of people share that view. You can’t have one rule for one, and another rule for another. That doesn’t sit well. That’s been our position.” In the manifesto Sinn Féin says “Ireland’s own immigration laws” should apply “once the special status of Ukrainians under the Temporary Protection Directive expires in March 2025”. The party’s general position on immigration now is that it does not support “open borders” – despite McDonald saying in an RTÉ interview in February that there is “no such thing” as open borders in Ireland. It is not fair to characterise the position as a policy shift, however. In its 2020 general election manifesto, Sinn Féin said it “does not want open borders” and believes that “all states must manage migration”. As the party prepares for the next general election – and potentially entering government – the bigger question is how it plans to deal with the reality of increased global migration. The answer is not clear. When asked on Thursday what her party would do differently in relation to the existing international protection system, McDonald said resources in the International Protection Office should be doubled, but she did not outline any policy changes beyond wanting a “fair, enforced and efficient” system. She also called for a “conversation” and “plan” for accommodation when the Temporary Protection Directive comes to an end next March. “For now we are in a war situation and the worst position you can be in is having no plan,” she said. Beyond migration much of what Sinn Féin is promising in its EU manifesto now is similar to what went before: a push for Irish unity, reforming the EU, defending Irish neutrality and reforming the Common Fisheries Policy. Its plans to cut “the bloated salaries of Commissioners, MEPs, and other top EU bureaucrats” did not feature in the 2019 document.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,False
"Sinn Féin ‘Eurocritical, not Eurosceptic’, says Mary Lou McDonald  Party’s manifesto says Sinn Féin opposes EU asylum and migration pact because ‘Ireland should retain sovereignty over its own borders and migration policy’ Sinn Féin is “Eurocritical” rather than Eurosceptic, party leader Mary Lou McDonald has said. Ahead of next week’s elections, Ms McDonald on Thursday launched the party’s European manifesto in Dublin and declared that she wants Sinn Féin to be the largest party in local and national government. She responded to reports of anger being directed at her candidates on the campaign trail by saying the “vast bulk” of people are “very reasonable”. Asked about the party’s position on the European Union, she said Sinn Féin is “Eurocritical” rather than Eurosceptic. “We need to work together on the big issues. But we don’t just sleepwalk along the road without thinking it out, without asking is this a good move,” she said. Ms McDonald said “Euroscepticism is a very British phenomenon” and accused Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil MEPs of being “unquestioning” and “uncritical” of the EU. On immigration, the party’s manifesto states that Sinn Féin is opposed to the EU asylum and migration pact because “Ireland should retain sovereignty over its own borders and migration policy”. The pact would see new rules put in place around the relocation of asylum seekers. The manifesto also says Sinn Féin wants to ensure “that Ireland’s own immigration laws will apply once the special status of Ukrainians under the Temporary Protection Directive” expires next March. Ms McDonald said there needed to be a “plan in respect of Ukrainian people living here in Ireland” given March will come around quickly, the temporary directive will end and “the question then is what happens next”. “In the absence of a thought-out plan, what will happen, I imagine, is that Ukrainians will go into our standard international protection system, which is under pressure and has suffered from a lack of Government planning and cohesion,” she said. The Sinn Féin leader said her view was that those “working in critical areas need their situation regularised by means of work permit” given there is a “labour shortage here in many critical parts of the economy”. “Ultimately, we have to have a conversation around the conflict in Ukraine, how long will it go on, are we forever going to be in an emergency situation, are we looking at something longer term. For now, we are in a war situation and the worst position you can be in is having no plan.” On international protection, Ms McDonald called for a system that is “fair, efficient and enforced” and for a doubling of resources in the International Protection Office. “On accommodation, there has to be emergency measures, there is no doubt about that. One of the big mistakes that has been made, and certainly we would correct this, is the failure to have dialogue and conversations with communities. It was, to my mind, the most damaging mistake the Government made,” she said. Asked about claims being made on some doorsteps, and by elements of the far-right, that Sinn Féin are “sell-outs”, she said there has been a “welcome on the mat” where she has canvassed. “In 2020 there was a big surge and appetite around change. We are four years down the line and I am very conscious there has been almost a frustration with people saying: ‘Well where is it? It has been talked about but can we just see it?’,” she said. “These elections now, it’s the first time people have that opportunity to come out and vote for change. I think that resolve is there and the proof of it will be there when the ballot boxes open.”",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants.

Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.757476644448841,False
"Tents at Grand Canal to be cleared again as pressure on Government mounts Asylum seekers to be brought to alternative accommodation in the Dublin area Tents housing asylum seekers are expected to be cleared from the Grand Canal in Dublin this morning, the third such clearance in recent weeks. The  Government is under increasing pressure about housing refugees,with complaints from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) about “scapegoating vulnerable people”. The men will be brought to alternative accommodation in the Dublin area, where they will be housed in tents but will have access to food and sanitary facilities. Arrangements were being finalised on Wednesday evening. More than 500 men have been transferred from the Grand Canal to safer and more secure facilities in recent weeks, officials say. Volunteers working with homeless asylum seekers have in recent days been contacting those without accommodation who are not sheltering at the canal, but are sleeping in bus stations, train stations, mosques, churches and in tents in and outside the city centre. They have compiled a list of more than 100 men, to advocate for them with the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) in the hope that they can access shelter on Thursday. On Wednesday night men arrived at the canal with tents in the hope of being included in any transport to accommodation. Volunteers, who have been providing food and water at the site, were offering tea and coffee and continuing to gather  names. The mood was upbeat as several men said they hoped they would access shelter on Thursday. Senior Government sources say that facilities at Thornton Hall in north Co Dublin, which is likely to house a large tented encampment for asylum seekers, are unlikely to be ready for four to six weeks. Government has been encouraged by a drop in the numbers of asylum seekers who have arrived in recent weeks. Yet sources stressed that the drop – to about 350 last week, from about 600 in previous weeks – may be temporary, or due to one-off factors. It is encouraging Government, however, to continue with a tightening of enforcement measures against people entering the State illegally, which have seen a sharp increase in Garda checks near the Border and the return of small numbers of people to the UK. The Government was criticised yesterday in the High Court and by organisations advocating for refugees and asylum seekers. A group of 30 NGOs, including the Irish Refugee Council (IRC), Focus Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and medical charity Safetynet, said they were particularly concerned by the plight of almost 2,000 male asylum seekers who remain without shelter. They said the Government was “punching down” and “scapegoating vulnerable people”, creating a vacuum being filled with misinformation about migrants. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee rejected the criticism by the NGOs saying the Government would “protect those who need protecting ... irrespective of where they have come from”. But she said the State “had to say no” to people who “genuinely do not need our protection, who are not fleeing war or persecution, who are coming from a safe country or a safe place”. Meanwhile, in a legal challenge by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission – the State’s human rights watchdog – the High Court was told that a lack of resources “cannot be relied upon” as an excuse for failing to provide asylum seekers with accommodation,  the IHREC’s lawyers told the court. The State begins its defence in the case today.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided.

"Poor performance in South raises stakes for Sinn Féin of upcoming election in North Mary Lou McDonald confidence of ‘nailed-on gains’ in UK election seems questionable  Amid the swirl of speculation about the date of the next general election, for some parties another poll is only three weeks away. The all-Ireland parties, to be precise; in the North, voters are facing a UK general election on July 4th – which means that Sinn Féin, still reeling from the shock of a bad day at the local and European elections on Friday, must regroup and fight another election campaign while figuring out what went wrong in the last one. This means sounding confident – presumably the motivation behind Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald’s remark to the media on Tuesday that the party was “going to perform really well in the Westminster elections. “I think we’re nailed on for some gains,” she said. Let’s unpick that for a moment. In a Westminster election Northern Ireland chooses 18 MPs, one for each constituency, all chosen by the first-past-the-post system. Sinn Féin currently has seven MPs – one behind the DUP on eight – and it’s reasonable, indeed likely, that it will retain all seven. If there is a doubt anywhere, it is over Fermanagh South Tyrone, which last time was won by Michelle Gildernew – currently awaiting her fate in Midlands-North-West – by 57 votes. If the replacement candidate loses, then questions will be asked about the wisdom of moving her across the Border. The only other constituency where Sinn Féin is realistically in the hunt is Foyle, but here the incumbent, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, is sitting on a majority of more than 17,000 and is expected to hold his seat. Beyond Foyle, it is not clear where these “gains” might come from; of the seats that may change hands, the battle is between unionism and Alliance, not the DUP and Sinn Féin. The difference between success and failure is often one of narrative. McDonald’s comment aside, the feeling within the party is that to retain its current seven would be a solid election result for Sinn Féin, particularly if – as could well happen – the DUP lose one or possibly more seats, thus allowing Sinn Féin to draw level or even overtake them. This in turn would reinforce another narrative, that of the inevitably of Sinn Féin’s onward march from the largest party at Assembly and council level to, it hopes, the “hat-trick” of Westminster – all the more important given the damage done by Friday’s results to another such narrative, that of its inexorable rise to the party of Government in the South. Sinn Féin needs a strong showing in the North to demonstrate the southern results were an anomaly rather than part of a pattern. Keeping its seven MPs would prove the party is an essentially steady ship, which remains on course. While no party can afford complacency, there is no reason to suggest things are otherwise. At the risk of stating the obvious, much is different in the North – not least the electoral system, voting patterns and the sociopolitical context – and in many constituencies Sinn Féin has a large majority that will not be overturned. The packed schedule will make personnel management a challenge. Its activists in Tyrone, for example, have just put in a shift canvassing in Donegal; now the Southerners must return the favour and start knocking doors enthusiastically in the North, then potentially face an autumn election in the South. Of the lessons of Friday’s election for Sinn Féin, one surely was the danger of over-ambition. All the more reason, therefore, not to over-promise “nailed-on ... gains” in the North.",-1,-1_northern_uk_dup_stormont,"['northern', 'uk', 'dup', 'stormont', 'posters', 'north', 'return', 'election', 'new', 'dáil']","['Irish unity in ‘touching distance’ after DUP vote, says McDonald Recall of the Assembly to elect Speaker could take place as early as Saturday Irish unity is within “touching distance” as a nationalist First Minister at Stormont is poised to come into office for the first time, according to Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Reacting to the DUP’s endorsement of a deal with the UK government that will end its two-year boycott of the powersharing Executive, Ms McDonald said the elevation of party vice-president Michelle O’Neill to the head of the North’s devolved government will be a moment of “very great significance”. The recall of the Assembly to elect a Speaker could take place as early as Saturday and DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson signalled on Tuesday his optimism that there are enough concessions to show that the “naysayers are wrong”. The deal is due to be published on Wednesday and Ms O’Neill said the next number of days are crucial to get the powersharing institutions up and running. Addressing media at Stormont, Ms McDonald alluded to previous political arrangements in Northern Ireland, saying: “I think a Sinn Féin First Minister, and Michelle coming into office as First Minister, for all really is the most striking evidence that that era is now gone; it is now consigned to the pages of the history books. “And more importantly it signals now the new Ireland emerging and the conversation around a new constitutional dispensation, ending partition, Irish unity, all of the opportunity that presents is in many ways embodied in this moment of Michelle O’Neill becoming First Minister here.” Ms McDonald added “I think that the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. And I think that’s a very exciting thing.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 when its former first minister Paul Givan quit the executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Donaldson admitted on Tuesday that they had not secured “everything” they had sought from London in relation to changes to the Windsor Framework deal struck between UK and EU last year. However, he said he had achieved a “good outcome for Northern Ireland” and pledged “zero” checks on goods and paperwork works destined for the North - through the “green lane” element of the Windsor Framework – from Britain. “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told reporters outside Stormont. Asked about a timeline for Stormont’s return, he said it was conditional upon the UK government “delivering on their side” but that he hoped it will happen quickly. DUP party discipline remained tight on Tuesday after Monday evening’s DUP executive meeting led to an internal party inquiry when details of Mr Donaldson’s briefing to 130 members were leaked by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Bryson live tweeted details in what he claimed was a “blow by blow account” of the five-hour meeting. Despite Mr Donaldson’s claims on Tuesday that there will be legal changes to the post-Brexit deal, Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris played down the prospect of fresh negotiations with the EU and said that “all conditions are now in place” for a return of the Executive. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was adamant that the Windsor Framework deal will not be changed “one sentence” and that the so-called Irish Sea Border will “still be there”. Mr Beattie expressed concern that the situation could “unravel” in coming days if the Assembly is not restored by Monday. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long told reporters it was a “bittersweet” day in that there was nothing in the DUP deal with the UK that “wasn’t available in 2018 under Theresa May”.', 'UK government publishes deal which will set stage for Stormont return Safeguarding the Union document was released online by the UK government on Wednesday  The text of the legislation which secured the DUP’s return to power-sharing in the North has been published. The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was released online by the UK government on Wednesday afternoon. The measures outlined in the document by the UK government include, as previously signalled, legislation “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the Union” and which amends the UK Internal Market Act 2020 to “guarantee Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the UK’s internal market.” It will also end dynamic alignment with EU law. Legislative change will “recognise the end of the automatic pipeline of EU law”; Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will be amended, “reflecting the new reality that the law which applies in Northern Ireland is now properly subject to the democratic oversight of the Northern Ireland Assembly through the Stormont Brake and the democratic consent mechanism.” The so-called Green Lane will be replaced with a UK internal market system, and the UK government “will commit that more than 80 per cent of all freight movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland take place under the UK internal market system, with independent scrutiny.” This will ensure “there will be no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks.” There will be a legal requirement that new legislation will be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, if so, for ministers to make a statement considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.” The document includes more than 20 provisions, which includes the creation of an Independent Monitoring Panel to “provide oversight of the implementation of new arrangements”, the creation of a UK East-West Council and the publication of operational arrangements for the Stormont Brake. The UK government will also “pursue an agreement with the EU on a long-term basis” to ensure the continued supply of necessary veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland beyond 2025. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said  before it was published that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. His party has been using a veto power to block Stormont’s devolved institutions for almost two years in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, Mr Donaldson announced earlier this week that his party was prepared to return to Stormont, dependent on the UK government implementing the various legislative assurances and other measures it has offered. This is expected to lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland within days and will see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill become the North’s first ever nationalist first minister. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return,” he said on Tuesday. The return of Stormont will also see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland. The financial package includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Mr Donaldson said the deal would represent a “significant change” in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit’s so-called Irish Sea border. He said: “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. “On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.” Sinn Féin has focused on the imminent return of the Stormont Assembly, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald stating that Irish unity is now within “touching distance” as she hailed the significance of her party assuming the role of Stormont first minister for the first time. Ms McDonald said the expected appointment of Ms O’Neill in the coming days would be a moment of “very great significance”. Mr Donaldson announced his support for a Stormont return after receiving the “decisive” backing of the 130-strong party executive during a five-hour meeting on Monday night. He said DUP party officers, a key 12-strong decision-making body, had also “mandated” him to move forward on the basis he was proposing. Support for the deal is not unanimous within the DUP and several senior figures remain opposed to the proposed agreement. - PA', 'Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024. In years to come, much will be made of the significance of this day. It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,False
"Holly Cairns could ‘potentially’ pause maternity leave during general election Social Democrats leader announces pregnancy after suffering miscarriages, as plans made for Cian O’Callaghan to step in during leave period Deputy leader of the Social Democrats Cian O’Callaghan will step in to lead the party when Holly Cairns is on maternity leave, the leader said after announcing her pregnancy. Speaking on RTÉ’s Sunday with Miriam show, Ms Cairns said she is also considering “potentially pausing maternity leave” if the general election happens at an unexpected time. The Cork South West TD announced, in an Instagram post on Saturday, that she and her partner Barry Looney are expecting a baby girl. She said that the news had “been getting harder and harder to keep under wraps (quite literally)”. “I am overjoyed to let you know that my partner and I are expecting a baby. We are so happy and feel so lucky because this is something we have wanted for a long time,” she wrote. Ms Cairns (34) said while she was delighted to share the news, she was initially hesitant, “because like so many other couples hoping to start a family, ours has not been a straightforward journey”. “But all the signs look good this pregnancy, so we are really hopeful. I’m definitely not the first woman to juggle work and a baby, but I also know that I have a unique job as a leader of a political party. “That’s why more than ever, I feel very grateful to belong to a party who are so supportive of parents and passionate about making sure we get #MoreMna into politics.” She added that she felt “very lucky” have a “great team” around her. “This along with the amazing results from last weekend, makes me more excited than ever to lead the Social Democrats into the next elections.” The couple had been “trying for some time”, and Ms Cairns went through two miscarriages last year, she said. On Sunday, Ms Cairns said: “In my naivety, we were trying to plan around the baby being a year or so old during a general election. We learned the hard way that it’s not always that easy to plan”. Miscarriages and difficulty conceiving were things that “happen to quite a lot of people and we just don’t hear about it,” the politician told Miriam O’Callaghan. “Hearing other women speak about it, I’ve found comforting and less alone. So I do think it’s important we talk more about that. It’s not easy,” she said. Ms Cairns said she felt “a new lease of life to be out of that danger zone” of the first trimester. She said she was now 17 weeks pregnant with a baby girl. “Normally you tell people after the three month scan but our focus was really on the election,” she said. She added that she had “never been more committed to leading the party”. Ms Cairns is the youngest party leader in the Dáil. The native of west Cork worked in disability services abroad before moving back to Cork to take on her family farm and business. She stood in the 2019 local elections in Cork and won a seat on Cork County Council. The following year she was elected as a TD. Ms Cairns took over the leadership of the Social Democrats in March of last year. During her time in the Dáil, Ms Cairns has acted as party spokesperson for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Further and Higher Education and Disability. Her partner Barry Looney is a hotelier from west Cork. His family owns the West Cork Hotel in Skibbereen. The Social Democrats almost doubled their local authority representation last weekend, going from 19 to 35 seats in the local elections. The party failed to have an MEP elected in the European elections. However, Ms Cairns said that she “could not be prouder of the exceptional campaigns” run by Rory Hearne, Susan Doyle and Sinead Gibney in  Midlands North West, Ireland South and Dublin respectively. Constituencies are “huge” and other parties had “a really big advantage” by running incumbent TDs and well known names, she said on Sunday “It’s difficult for [our candidates] to break through in that context,” she said. She again ruled out a merger with Labour, after receiving some of the party’s votes through transfers. “I’m running out of ways to say no to this question. We’re focused on growing our party. We doubled our seats, the Labour Party went down,” she said, adding: “It’s not something we want or consider.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Sinn Féin to ‘dust ourselves off’ after it failed to reach electoral ambitions Party got ‘a knock’ with poor performance this month, says Mary Lou McDonald Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said her party will “dust ourselves off” after it failed to reach its electoral ambitions in the recent local and European elections. Ms McDonald said Sinn Féin got “a knock” after the party put in a poor performance earlier this month. Sinn Féin, who was widely seen as the government-in-waiting, suffered a setback when its support dropped well below what was projected. Ms McDonald said the party has started a review into what went wrong in its electoral campaign, particularly as parties prepare for a general election, which could take place later this year. “We know political struggle isn’t easy. Things don’t always go the way you want,” Ms McDonald told the annual Wolfe Tone commemoration in Co Kildare. “This is a party built on incredible sacrifice and on that enormous reservoir of courage, resilience and hope that sees us through the tough times. “We had a knock at the recent local elections. The result didn’t match the scale of our ambitions. But it’s how we respond to setbacks that determines the future. We will come back now with determination and belief. “We’re often at our best when our backs are to the wall, when the going gets tough and when our political opponents write us off with glee. Let them. “The match is not over. The story is not finished.” She said the Irish public have a choice at the next general election. “More crises, more failure, more of the same under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, or a government for real change led by Sinn Féin,” she said. “We will approach this election with real purpose, confidence and energy. “My message to people is simple. Sinn Féinhas heard you. I have heard you. “We will now work even harder to deliver the Ireland you deserve – a society and a nation that has the backs of ordinary people. “The next opportunity to advance our vision of a new Ireland is happening now.” – PA",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Minister questions ownership of of XL Bully dog ‘bred to be aggressive’  Fine Gael’s Heather Humphreys consulting Attorney General on regulation and legislation regarding ban on breed  A ban on the crossbreed dog XL Bully will be considered this week by Minister for Community Development Heather Humphreys when she meets a stakeholder group on dog control. The group, established to look at all policy and legislative aspects of the Dog Control Act and Dog Breeding Establishment Act, is expected to advise the Minister on how a ban could be effectively implemented following serious incidents involving XL bullies including the fatal attack earlier this month on Limerick woman Nicole Morey. A ban will be introduced in the North on the crossbreed XL Bully and comes into effect in Britain on July 1st. Dealing with the issue in the Dáil this week the Minister stressed that “we do not want to be out of kilter with Northern Ireland. There is no point in them being banned there and having a different arrangement south of the Border.” But she said “we have to tease out how we will police and manage this and what it really means. It is okay to ban things, but it is about how we implement the ban and make sure we achieve” an effective outcome. She is also looking at how bans were introduced in Denmark and France. “It is true that any dog can bite a person, but the damage caused by XL Bullies happens because their jaws lock and it is not possible to get them off,” she said. “I absolutely do not know why anyone would want to own an XL Bully. That is being straight. They are bred to be aggressive and they are dangerous in my book,” she said. The ban could be in place early if it is done through regulation but legislation would take longer.

Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close.

"Dáil accepts controversial EU Migration Pact by 79 votes to 72 Accord comes into effect in two years with aim of processing asylum applications within 12 weeks  The Dáil has voted by 79 votes to 72 to opt into the controversial EU Migration and Asylum Pact for a standardised immigration control system across the 27 member states. The pact has been in discussion at EU level for the past eight years and the Government announced three months ago that it would be opting in to the pact, which will come into effect in two years’ time. Under the pact’s rules, there will be tougher border security checks including identification and health checks with the collection of biometric data including fingerprints for anyone above the age of six. A substantial increase in the number of staff processing applications will now be required along with new processing and accommodation centres. Migrants will be accommodated in holding centres close to airports and ports, which the Government has insisted will not be detention centres, while asylum seekers’ applications will be processed within a maximum of 12 weeks. Where an application is rejected, asylum seekers will have to be returned forcibly to their home country within the same period. Member states will be required, based on their population size, to take in thousands of migrants from “frontline” countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain, or provide funding instead. The Government has insisted that Ireland cannot go it alone on migration. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said the agreement “represents an important balance between effective asylum and return procedures and protections for those seeking protection who are the most vulnerable. This agreement will allow for unprecedented reforms, and a more effective, coherent and fair system to manage migration in the EU. “Those who have a right to international protection must be given that status as quickly as possible. For those who are found not to have a right to international protection, they must return to their home country as quickly as possible.” Critics have described the pact as the creation of “fortress Europe” and opposition parties have opposed the pact. Over a number of days of debate, Sinn Féin has repeatedly called on the Government to opt out of the majority of the pact’s provisions, claiming the hands of future Irish governments will be tied. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald has said the Government’s failure to opt out of any aspect of the pact is a “dangerous erosion” of Irish sovereignty. Ms McDonald said that in dealing with taxation, foreign affairs and migration, “power should remain with the Irish Government”. During the debate, Labour leader Ivana Bacik said there should be a united approach in the EU to migration but this pact did not properly deliver on solidarity with the global south.  She rejected the Government’s “take it or leave it” attitude. Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns described individual aspects of the pact as worth opting into but her party had “very serious human rights concerns” with the overall pact which she described as “dangerous”.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,False
"Legislation introduced to allow comedians access to Arts Council funding Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh says ‘comedians are recognised and have the support of the relevant arts councils’ in other countries Legislation has been introduced to amend the Arts Act to ensure that comedy is specifically or explicitly recognised as an art form within the arts, in order to allow comedians access to Arts Council funding. Sinn Féin arts spokesman Aengus Ó Snodaigh said “all it requires is one word to be added to the Arts Act, that is, comedy. It is simple. That is literally what it is. It is a very simple piece of legislation which would address the problem of the exclusion of that form of art.” The Arts (Recognition of Comedy) (Amendment) Bill 2024 should not be necessary, he said. “The Arts Council could address this issue quite quickly ... by deciding to broaden its interpretation and to act to end the exclusion of comedians from the funding opportunities and resources that are available for other artists.” He said that “currently the law allows for comedians to be recognised as artists either under the umbrella of theatre or as a form of art not explicitly mentioned in the legislation”. “But that is the problem” and the Department of Arts and Culture “has admitted as much”. He said Minister for Arts Catherine Martin could act immediately and “issue a policy directive to the Arts Council to broaden its interpretation to cover comedy. That is her right under section 5 of the Arts Act, 2003″. He added that in the absence of any such action it fell on TDs as legislators “to make the law clearer to ensure there is no exclusion or any doubt in respect of comedy as a form of art or of comedians as artists”. Mr Ó Snodaigh added that “we could say this is a laughing matter and talk puns but we have all watched and listened to comedians and enjoyed it. When times are dark, sometimes, that is the best form of medicine”. The Dublin South-Central TD said a petition signed by 1,300 people called for “stand up, improv and sketch comedy to be recognised and funded by the Arts Council”. He pointed out that in other countries, “comedy and comedians are recognised and have the support of the relevant arts councils, such as in Scotland and New Zealand. “If you look around the country, there are absolutely fabulous festivals both in Dublin and in Kilkenny, Galway and all around the country. Venues pop up, close and pop up again all around. They provide a platform. We also enjoy comedy on our television, radio and in films.” Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl commended Mr Ó Snodaigh “for putting forward an entirely positive and simple piece of legislation. He is right in what he said; at the lowest times in our lives, our comedians have the ability to lift our spirits. That is what we need.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Short-term letting crackdown Bill due before Cabinet after concerns ‘boxed off’ Aim of legislation is to take up to 12,000 properties out of short-term letting sector and make them available to people seeking long-term rentals The Government has been given the green light to proceed with plans to impose new rules on short-term property lettings, in a move which could free up thousands of properties for the rental sector. The Cabinet Committee on Housing met late last week where Ministers were told that the revised Short-Term Tourist Letting Bill will be brought before Cabinet on June 11th, following months of discussion with the European Commission. The commission previously raised concerns that the proposed legislation would be in contravention of European law. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and officials from the Department of Tourism met  the commission last December and again this February to discuss the plans. A senior Government source confirmed  those issues have now been “boxed off” and that the “green light” has been given to proceed with the plan, although further correspondence with the EU is anticipated after the heads of the Bill go to Cabinet. After the legislation is approved at Cabinet, Mr O’Brien and Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin will again write to the commission through a system known as the TRIS notification process, to inform them of the progress of the Bill. Ministers will also get a chance this week to submit any observations on the plans as part of the forthcoming Cabinet memo. Sources said the new Bill had to align with a new EU Short Term Rental Regulation law, but that this work was “95 per cent complete”. The plans to limit short-term letting would mean a person could not advertise a property on such platforms without a registration number. The aim of the legislation is to take as many as 12,000 properties out of the short-term letting sector and make them available to people seeking long-term rentals. Under the plans, property owners offering accommodation for periods of up to and including 21 nights will need to be registered with Fáilte Ireland. The tourism agency will monitor online platforms to ensure compliance with the obligation for advertised properties to have a valid registration number. Fáilte Ireland will have 10 staff monitoring websites for compliance with the registration rules. It will be able to levy a €300 fixed-penalty notice on property owners who advertise their property without a valid registration number. Property owners and online platforms who breach the new short-term letting rules will also face fines of up to €5,000. There has been concern in recent years at the number of properties being let out to tourists. While many of these are people making some extra income by renting out rooms in their homes, others are full properties being let out to the benefit of owners who can make even more than if the property was in the long-term rental market. There will be a “clarification period” of up to six months. This will allow property owners who need to apply for change-of-use planning permission to continue to offer their accommodation to tourists while their application is being considered and processed. Planning guidelines will also be issued to local authorities to supplement the introduction of the legislation. In a letter issued to Government in February, the European Commission said parts of the 2022 draft of the Short-Term Tourist Letting Bill contravened EU laws protecting the freedom to provide online services across the European Single Market. Ministers were told at the Cabinet committee last week of the work in recent months to bring the Irish law into complete alignment with European laws, and that the EU Commission had responded positively to the work done.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.4231480893252413,False
"Airlines face increased fines if passengers do not have valid travel documents Fines of up to €5,000 could be imposed on carriers under plans going to Cabinet on Wednesday Airlines will face increased fines of up to €5,000 if they fail to ensure a passenger has a valid travel document, under plans going to Cabinet on Wednesday. Minister for Justice Helen McEntee will bring a review of airline fines to Government this week and propose the increase, to be enacted before the summer recess. It was not immediately clear on Tuesday when the new regime would come into effect. Under immigration laws passed in 2003, airlines and other carriers have an obligation to ensure passengers travelling to the State have a valid travel document establishing their identity and nationality, and the appropriate visa required. If an airline or other carrier fails to abide by its obligations, it can face fines for offences for each passenger on a particular flight. Airlines are able to avoid convictions by paying a lower level of fine within 28 days of the offence. That level is currently €1,500, and it will be raised to €2,500. The immigration review also recommends the Department of Justice and the Garda National Immigration Bureau draw up relevant guidelines to support carriers in the implementation of checks. It says there should be consideration of a “dynamic fines model”, recognising carriers that strongly enforce checks and giving heavier fines to those who do not address gaps and show improvements. The Irish Times reported in April that information provided to the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee indicated the Government was considering tightening rules around documentation, as well as a new “gate check” programme that could see airlines escape fines if they put in place an audited higher standard of document checking. The Government is planning to clamp down on visa-free travel from countries with significant numbers of international protection applicants or where travel documents are routinely being used inappropriately.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year.

"Mary Lou McDonald shifts on €300,000 target for average Dublin house prices Sinn Féin leader says party would sell affordable homes for that figure rather than aim to lower average price The Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, has said her party would have a scheme to sell affordable homes in Dublin for €300,000, appearing to move away from a previous position where she had indicated that average house prices in Dublin should fall to the same figure. In an interview with The Irish Times before Christmas Ms McDonald suggested that she wished to see average house prices in Dublin fall to about €300,000, from a current level of about €420,000. She has since been fiercely criticised on the issue by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, which have demanded to know how Sinn Féin would achieve the policy. On Tuesday, Ms McDonald told RTÉ’s Today with Claire Byrne that the €300,000 figure related to an “an affordable housing scheme”. “I am talking about an affordable housing scheme,” Ms McDonald said. “And this is tailored at that specific cohort of people who are squeezed in the middle.” She denied that anyone would be faced with negative equity as a consequence of a fall in house prices. She said the €300,000 figure was “the affordable price”, agreeing with presenter Claire Byrne that it was not the target for the average house price in Dublin. This is an apparent contradiction of her comments to The Irish Times before Christmas. Asked then how far she would like to see house prices in Dublin fall, Ms McDonald said: “I want to see rents come down also. I think there is a huge crisis of affordability. I mean, for us, the figure of affordability, I would say the €300,000 mark in a place like Dublin, but obviously there would be a regional variation on that. The objective has to be to get prices as low as we feasibly can.” Since her comments to The Irish Times, Ms McDonald has been repeatedly targeted by political opponents, especially in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. They have warned that a slump in house prices would leave many people who have bought in recent years in negative equity, and have repeatedly demanded to know how Sinn Féin in government would achieve a drop in house prices. In response, a spokesperson for Ms McDonald said: “In her interview, Mary Lou McDonald made the point that affordability in Dublin should be in the region of €300,000 and that is why Sinn Féin plans to deliver an affordable housing scheme that would deliver homes at scale for that price in Dublin city and lower again in the regions. “Workers and families on average incomes are locked out of the housing market including nurses, teachers, retail workers, factory workers and we need to deliver affordable homes that they can afford to buy. This proposal has been outlined on many occasions by our housing spokesperson, we have also put forward motions to the Dáil on it and the detail is also on our website.” Later at a campaign event, Ms McDonald blamed Fine Gael for its “failure on housing” which she said had “resulted in the collapse of home ownership for so many across our city”. “Fine Gael’s failure on housing is clear to see in Dublin. Many people in neighbourhoods right across our capital city are faced with the choice of continuing to live with their parents well into their 30s, paying extortionate rents or feeling forced to emigrate because they can’t see a future for themselves here in Ireland,” Ms McDonald said in a statement subsequently issued by the party. She said that, in partnership with local authorities and approved housing bodies, Sinn Féin would “deliver homes for under €300,000, alongside the delivery of large-scale social housing”.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Seanad to sit three days next week to pass two key Government Bills Opposition sees sign of autumn election as Coalition moves to have legislation passed on planning, and designating the UK as a safe third country Seanad Éireann will reconvene next week for three full sitting days to facilitate the passage of two key Government Bills before the summer recess. While the Dáil adjourned for the summer on Thursday evening, the Upper House is scheduled to sit between Monday and Wednesday next week to debate the mammoth Planning and Development Bill 2023 as well as the Courts, Civil Law, Criminal Law Bill 2024. Both are likely to be subject to guillotine before the Seanad rises at 5.30pm on Wednesday. The Bills are among a large number that have been brought before the Dáil during its last sitting week, and which have been taken by the Opposition as a sign that the Government is planning for an election in the autumn. The Planning Bill, which has 590 sections and 25 parts, has been the subject of months of debate in committee. One of its intentions is to streamline the planning process. Its proposals to increase the threshold required before submissions are made, particularly to the courts, has been the subject of prolonged debate. The Bill was guillotined in the Dáil last month, despite over 500 amendments not having been taken. The Courts Bill, if passed, will allow the Government to designate the United Kingdom as a safe third country. This is seen as addressing a High Court decision last March that ruled Ireland’s designation of the UK as a safe third country was unlawful. It prevented the Government returning asylum seekers who had come from the UK. In recent weeks, the Coalition has also moved swiftly to get Oireachtas approval for policies that are important for its three parties, including the approval of the EU Nature Restoration Law as well as a vote to opt into all seven parts of the EU Asylum and Migration Pact. However, several key pieces of legislation for this Coalition will have to complete their passage through the Oireachtas early in the autumn session if they are to be enacted before the Government calls a general election. The Gambling Regulation Bill 2022 proposes to establish a new Gambling Regulatory Authority and will bring in strict new laws around gambling, and the publicity of gambling. It has passed through all stages of the Dáil but has yet to be completed in the Seanad. The Bill to abolish the two university panels in Seanad Éireann and to replace them with a panel that can be voted on by all third level graduates is unlikely to become law if there is an early election. It was included in 28 Bills that were prioritised for publication during the summer session by Chief Whip Hildegarde Naughton. However, it has yet to be published.  Only 11 of the 28 Bills had been published by the time the Dáil adjourned. A number of Bills were enacted during the session that would be seen as important pieces of legislation for the Government. They included the long-awaited Auto Enrolment Retirement Savings Plan Bill 2024, aimed at people with no private pensions. The Bill giving statutory backing to the two new rainy-day funds – the Future Ireland Fund and the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund – have also been enacted, as have Acts creating safe zones around abortion facilities; creating new offences for those who engage children in criminal activities; and the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill, which, for the first time, provides a statutory framework for surrogacy.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve.

"Man charged in relation to alleged threats to Mary Lou McDonald and Drew Harris Sinn Féin leader says there has been a focus online aimed at alienating sentiment towards her and her party A man suspected of making online threats to shoot Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and Garda Commissioner Drew Harris following violence in Coolock, Dublin, has been charged by gardaí. The man (28), from west Dublin, was arrested and taken for questioning by members of the Special Detective Unit, which is responsible for matters of State security, on Thursday. He has since been charged under Section 5 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 at a Garda Station in Dublin and is due to appear before the Criminal Courts of Justice (CCJ) on Friday morning. Despite wearing a makeshift balaclava while issuing the threats on the social media platform TikTok, the man was quickly identified by gardaí as a result of the personal details he posted online.  In the video, since removed from TikTok, a man allegedly threatened violence against Ms McDonald and Mr Harris while expressing support for people engaged in disturbances outside proposed asylum seeker accommodation in Coolock. Gardaí have become increasingly concerned in recent months about commentary directed at political figures by far-right extremists. Protection measures for Cabinet members have been increased and security advice has been provided to elected representatives. Speaking on Thursday morning, Ms McDonald said she was determined not to let the incident deter her. The Dublin Central TD said the experience had been “very frightening” but she was thankful for public support and was now “calling out” it out.  “I’ve had a year of it, of being trashed and vilified. It’s politically inspired. I’m sick of it,” she told Newstalk Breakfast. Ms McDonald criticised social media platforms for allowing such content to go unchecked while the accounts of democratically elected people were blocked from displaying political content. “There’s material in circulation, not just on TikTok, but other social media platforms and I scratch my head and wonder how, in the name of God, any platform that’s moderated in any way, becomes a vector for the level of hate and at the level of misinformation, the level of viciousness.” The Sinn Féin leader said being challenged and criticised was part of the job, but there had been a particularly vicious focus on her and her party in the last year. She said there was clear attempt to “alienate sentiment, particularly in working class areas, to brand me as a traitor, to brand Sinn Féin as a traitor”. The incident would “absolutely not” make her think of stepping back from politics, Ms McDonald added. “If anything, it makes me all the more determined to be part of facing this toxic dynamic down with others ... We cannot allow the toxic legacy of hate to win.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Social Democrats will find it hard to fill vacuum left by departure of Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall   Departures unlikely to signal any major policy change in the party  given they both stepped down as co-leaders last year With nearly 50 years of Dáil experience between them, Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall will depart the political stage at the next election and leave in their wake a vacuum which the Social Democrats will find hard to fill. Shortall has nearly 32 years’ experience as a TD, and has been re-elected at every general election since she won her first Dáil seat in 1992, which is no mean feat. Across Shortall’s Dublin North West constituency locals have become so accustomed to seeing her name on the ballot paper, and are so familiar with her work and politics, that she has more or less become part of the political furniture for many voters. Some party figures, asked on Tuesday for their view about who should replace her in Dublin North West, were genuinely at a loss to do so. One name mentioned is councillor Mary Callaghan, who was re-elected in Ballymun-Finglas in last month’s local elections. The problem is that very few people beyond the Soc Dems front bench enjoy the kind of national profile that Shortall has built up over three decades. While there may still be a left-leaning vote that would favour a Social Democrat in Dublin North West, the loss of Shortall’s personal brand will be surely be felt as the next general election approaches. It’s a similar picture in Kildare North where the loss of Catherine Murphy’s personal brand will see a handful of councillors vying to step into her shoes. She has been involved in local political campaigns since 1983 and has built a reputation as having an investigative nose on the Public Accounts Committee with an ability to zone in on detailed financial issues. The party recently increased its representation on Kildare County Council by three seats to seven, and a selection convention could see one or even two of these politicians selected. Beyond the tricky task of filling the shoes of two experienced female politicians the question will be asked about what will change for the Social Democrats when the pair bow out at the next general election. A merger with the Labour Party is as unlikely as ever as party leader Holly Cairns is unequivocally opposed to combining forces. Their departure is unlikely to signal any kind of major policy change given they both stepped down as co-leaders last year. The biggest change will be for younger members of the parliamentary party, who will lose two mentors and decades of institutional knowledge and experience ahead of a crucial election.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee.

"Children who offend could see sentences deferred to give them chance to address behaviour New measures are detailed in a draft memo to Cabinet by Minister for Justice Helen McEntee Children who offend could see their sentence deferred to give them an opportunity to address their behaviour, as part of Government plans to provide an alternative to suspended sentences. The new measures are detailed in a draft memo to Cabinet by Minister for Justice Helen McEntee. The memo was circulated last month. As part of a new piece of legislation, the Children (Amendment) Bill 2024, a new measure known as a deferred sentence supervision order (DSSO) could be introduced as an alternative to suspended sentences for children. A DSSO will be imposed if a judge decides that a sentence of detention is the appropriate penalty. The judge could then defer the sentencing hearing for up to a year. During this time, the child will be under the supervision of the Probation Service with a view to addressing their offending behaviour. If the child complies with the terms of their probation, then the judge will discharge the child. However, if the child fails to engage with the Probation Service, the judge will then make an order for detention in Oberstown. This overall plan will provide the child with a last chance to deal with their offending behaviour before detention is ordered, the memo states. In 2016, the Office of the Attorney General advised the Department of Children and Youth Affairs that it is legally unsafe for any court to suspend a period of detention given to a child. In November 2017, the Court of Appeal confirmed that there is no power to suspend, in whole or in part, sentences of detention for children. In July 2019, the Government approved plans to draft legislation to ensure that there are sufficient alternative sentencing options to fully and partly suspended sentences. However, rather than providing a legislative framework for suspended sentences for children, the focus is now, instead, on looking at alternative sentencing options. There will also be changes to detention and supervision orders, to ensure that the supervision element of the sanction can be enforced once a child turns 18 years old. Ministers were told that these orders have been underutilised because the supervision portion is currently unenforceable when a child turns 18. The Department said it considers the value of these orders to be “immense” for young people leaving detention.",2,2_abuse_schools_religious_orders,"['abuse', 'schools', 'religious', 'orders', 'inquiry', 'report', 'survivors', 'scoping', 'sexual', 'redress']","['Labour calls for acceleration of divestment of schools from religious orders after abuse inquiry Ivana Bacik emphasises need for timely redress scheme and says her party willing to work with Government to make this happen The State should urgently reboot the process to divest schools from religious patronage, Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik has said. She said the process had been started by her party colleague Ruairí Quinn when Minister for Education in 2011 but had effectively stalled since he stood down as minister. The Labour leader made the call when responding to the publication of a scoping report which disclosed widespread sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders throughout the State. Speaking before the start of a special parliamentary meeting of her party at the Grand Hotel in Malahide, Ms Bacik also said it was vital that a Redress Scheme be run in parallel with the Commission of Investigation so that survivors are not waiting any longer for justice to be done for them. She also welcomed that the Garda had begun criminal investigations into some of the over 800 alleged abusers identified by victims in 308 schools. “We [need] to look at the divestment of schools from religious orders. For far too long, our school system in Ireland, uniquely in Europe, has been dominated by religious [orders].” She said that over 90 per cent of our primary schools still had religious patronage. “We need to ensure there’s divestment, that we see that the process initiated by Ruairí Quinn is now speeded up and continued, so that religious orders, complicit in such awful horrors in the past, no longer have authority over our schoolchildren in our education system.” She said a core “mission” of the Labour Party was to afford children the right to have an equal future and an equal start. She said in the last redress scheme – in relation to abuse which occurred in religious-run residential settings for children, the orders had not paid their fair share. “Far too many hid behind what we might describe as the developer’s wife system, where their assets were transferred to a trust. What we want to see with this new set of revelations is that the religious orders made to pay their share.” Ms Bacik told reporters it was her view that the Commission should begin its work by looking at the 308 schools included in the scoping inquiry and then extending to look at other schools. She again emphasised the need for a timely redress scheme and said her party was willing to work with the Government to make this happen. She said Minister for Education Norma Foley had worked very closely with other parties during the scoping inquiry and was very respectful of the wishes of survivors throughout the process. Asked if there was a means of ensuring that religious orders paid their share, Ms Bacik said there was nothing illegal about the trust system but there were “serious ethical questions” that had to be asked about why the orders had done so. Asked about the responsibility of the State, she said nobody was suggesting the religious orders should bear 100 per cent responsibility. “Clearly, the State was deeply at fault for failure to regulate, failure to ensure proper governance in schools, for really abdicating responsibility for running and governance of schools and management of schools to religious orders,” she said. Speaking about her party’s preparation for the general election, she said that it had already selected 16 candidates and was buoyed by strong results in the local and European elections. However, she would not put a figure on how many seats the party expected to win, other than to say she wanted to return with more seats than its present six. Ms Bacik said the party would not be involved in a vote transfer agreement with any other party before the general election. “After the election, certainly, we will look to sit down with those parties and representatives who share our vision, our centre left and social democratic values. “We will be looking to form a bloc for negotiations on any programme for Government to make sure that our Labour vision and values form the heart of the next Government.”', 'Major inquiry into sexual abuse in schools to be recommended by scoping report The scoping inquiry was commissioned last year after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by past pupils A scoping report on historical abuse at boarding and day schools run by religious orders is understood to recommend a statutory inquiry be set up to examine the sexual abuse of potentially thousands of children. The leaders of the Government parties discussed the issue on Tuesday night with the Minister for Education Norma Foley, whose department commissioned the scoping report by senior counsel Mary O’Toole last year. The report, which runs to more than 700 pages, was expected to be discussed by the Cabinet on Wednesday but that was postponed, three people familiar with the issue said. It is expected that officials will continue to work on a plan for publication of the report, and to work with survivors of abuse. It is likely to be approved by the Cabinet and published in September, after which a statutory inquiry is expected to be established. Once an inquiry has been concluded, it is likely that a redress scheme, to be funded at least in part by contributions from the religious order, will be established. The scoping inquiry was instituted last year by Ms Foley after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by a number of past pupils. The allegations first emerged when two brothers, David and Mark Ryan, spoke publicly of being sexually abused by priests at Blackrock College and its affiliate junior school, Willow Park. Both schools were run by the Spiritan congregation, formerly the Holy Ghost Fathers. The brothers first spoke about being sexually abused as boys in the south Dublin secondary school in an RTÉ radio documentary, Blackrock Boys, in 2022. They discovered each other’s abuse only in 2002, many years after it took place. Mark Ryan died last year in London after suffering a suspected heart attack. The documentary led to a wave of revelations and hundreds of survivors reporting they were also abused as boys in schools run by the Spiritans, as well as other congregations who ran day and boarding schools in the past. It later emerged that more than 140 people reported incidences of child sexual abuse involving 18 abusers to gardaí investigating such allegations at the schools in south Dublin. The scoping inquiry was set up by the Department of Education to advise the Government on the nature of the issue and the possible next steps. It was broadened to include allegations of abuse in religious-run boarding and day schools, and received more than 200 submissions. It is understood the report features schools runs by many different religious orders. The report was delivered to Ms Foley in early June. It is understood it has estimated that there may be thousands of cases of sexual abuse in the schools. Ms Foley and her officials have been working on proposals which will be heavily influenced by the wishes of survivors of abuse in the schools. The terms of reference for the scoping exercise specifically required that Ms O’Toole, in making recommendations to the Government, should have regard to “alignment with outcomes sought by survivors of historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders”. It says this should be “informed by the survivor engagement process” which has been part of the scoping inquiry’s work.', 'Statutory inquiry into sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools agreed at Cabinet Work on preparations for the inquiry by officials, including legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas, will begin shortly  The Government has formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools. Work on preparations for the inquiry by officials, including legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas, will begin shortly and there is also expected to be extensive consultations with survivors of abuse. The proposals were brought to the Government on Tuesday morning by Minister for Education Norma Foley following agreement among the three Coalition party leaders on Monday night. It is understood that the Government intends to set up a Commission of Investigation, in line with the report’s recommendations. Discussions on the terms of reference will take place over the coming weeks, it is expected, but the recommendation from the scoping report is that all types of school should be included, rather than just those run by religious orders. A scoping report into the allegations of abuse at schools run by religious orders – prompted by accounts of abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin, which in turn prompted an outpouring of similar stories – is expected to be published by the Government, perhaps as early as this evening. Ms Foley and her officials have been considering the 700-page report, commissioned last year from senior counsel Mary O’Toole following allegations of historic abuse at Blackrock College. The scoping inquiry conducted by Ms O’Toole included religious-run boarding and day schools, and it is understood that the report features schools run by many different religious orders. Sources say that there may be thousands of cases of sexual abuse in the schools. Officials are continuing to work on proposals for a redress scheme for victims of past abuse with at least part of the costs being met by the religious orders. Ms Foley and her officials have been drawing up plans which are expected to be heavily influenced by the wishes of survivors. The terms of reference for the scoping exercise specifically required that Ms O’Toole, when making recommendations to the Government, should have regard to “alignment with outcomes sought by survivors of historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders”. It says this should be “informed by the survivor engagement process” which has been part of the scoping inquiry’s work. An advocacy group for victims of sexual abuse in Spiritan schools said the establishment of a redress scheme only after the conclusion of any inquiry would result in “further delays to urgently needed justice”. A statement released by the Restore Together group said any statutory inquiry “must be structured to reflect the urgency of the situation” and by “putting the best interests of victims/survivors first”. The group said this could be done by “the concurrent operation of parallel strands of any inquiry aimed at providing healing, redress and justice”. Survivors received communication from the Government’s Survivor Engagement Lead Kieran McGrath on Tuesday morning informing them a copy of the report would be made available to them before it was published. “We recognise that receiving the Report is significant and that there is likely to be media coverage and discussion of the contents in the coming days. We understand that this may be difficult for you,” Mr McGrath said in an email on Tuesday. He also said that up to six sessions with a qualified counsellor would be made available to any survivor who requested it, with longer term support available from One in Four and other organisations.']",abuse - schools - religious - orders - inquiry - report - survivors - scoping - sexual - redress,0.5509003409336096,False
"Sinn Féin’s immigration policy clears path for objecting to asylum centres The feasibility of finding an area that meets Sinn Féin‘s criteria is not a subject that is likely to bother the party There are two key takeaways from Sinn Féin’s new immigration policy, which has been launched just weeks after a disappointing local election campaign. Firstly, it is obvious that the party wants to win back the support of under-pressure and working class communities  which feel disconnected from Sinn Féin on the issue of immigration. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald made it clear that she believes better-off areas should be shouldering more responsibility for housing International Protection Applicants, rather than areas which have suffered from disadvantage. Sinn Féin wants to see communities audited before anyone is housed there, using specific criteria to determine whether the area is suitable or not. The second takeaway flows from this: the way is now effectively cleared for elected representatives in Sinn Féin to object to asylum seeker accommodation plans because the audit they called for has not happened. The party says that such a pre-assessment would look at the availability of services including GPs and school places, the proximity to transport and also the existing levels of disadvantage. This, they say, will govern the selection of locations for accommodation. Asked what other data would be used, Sinn Féin referenced census data, CSO data and also the Pobal HP Deprivation Index. McDonald was asked on Tuesday to name three places where accommodation centres could potentially be located if all of these criteria were to be met (enough school places, easy access to doctors and healthcare, plenty of public transport, no disadvantage) but she dismissed the question by stating that arbitrarily naming locations has been part of the problem. It was a fair question, though. Once these factors are considered, alongside public submissions, it is hard to see any location where new centres would pass muster. Regardless of this, Sinn Féin are zoning in on something specific. Some of the anger or anxiety in communities around the country has come on the back of a feeling locally that resources are being spread too thin. Sinn Féin is attempting to tap back into that anger, to align itself more closely with the views of these voters. Whether an extensive community audit is feasible or unfeasible is probably not a question that will overly vex the Sinn Féin leadership, as the party moves firmly back into the trenches of being the main party of Opposition rather than giving answers as if they were already in government. Sinn Féin also stood accused before the last election of not having a crystal clear immigration policy. The message on Tuesday was: we have a plan – and it’s different from the Government’s plan. Apart from the extensive community pre-assessment idea, though, it is not a world away from what the Coalition is doing. Sinn Féin say, for example, that they want to treble the numbers in the International Protection Offices from 400 to 1,200. At present there are around 480 staff working in the IPO, and the Government has already pledged to increase the number of staff by 400 in the next 12 months. Sinn Féin also wants to ensure “greater follow up” of deportation orders; the Government has freed up 100 gardaí from back office roles to support immigration enforcement activities, including deportations. The big push in Sinn Féin’s new plan is undoubtedly towards working class voters and under pressure communities. In making their pitch, Sinn Féin has told middle-class communities they will likely have to do more. This, Mary Lou McDonald said, is a “fair ask.” Sinn Féin has asked, but how will those voters respond?",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.674335725275546,False
"RTÉ to receive €725m in public funding over next three years Licence fee income and direct state funding to be combined for package below what broadcaster sought RTÉ will receive public funding of €725 million over the next three years, the Government is set to announce on Wednesday - though this figure is below what the station has sought. The funding will be comprised of licence fee income and direct state funding, though the exact composition of the package is not yet clear. It is understood the broadcaster sought €255 million in State funding for next year, €260 million for 2026 and €265 million for 2027, adding up to a total of €780m. The new deal to fund RTÉ is top of the agenda at the final Cabinet meeting before the August break on Wednesday, with Minister for Media and Arts Catherine Martin due to announce the details of the long-awaited package. It is expected that the television licence fee will be retained but the Government will commit to multiyear exchequer funding to RTÉ, under a deal hammered out between Ms Martin and other Ministers in recent weeks. It represents a compromise between the two sides, with Ms Martin failing in her bid to have the television licence fee abolished but succeeding in securing multiyear exchequer funding for the station. It is also expected that An Post will be provided with €6 million in exchequer funding over three years in order to improve collection of the TV licence. Sources with knowledge of the discussions, however, questioned how much extra funding would be actually delivered and suggested that at least some of the money would come from within the budget of the Department of Arts and Media – meaning that other interests could suffer. It is also not clear how the Government can guarantee RTÉ funding beyond its term in office.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.7431654016719372,False
"Thousands of Ukrainian refugees to have welfare allowances cut from September Changes will affect some 19,000 refugees in State-provided, full-board accommodation who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 Ukrainian refugees who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 will have their welfare allowances cut from September under plans agreed by Cabinet on Wednesday. The payments for Ukrainian refugees living in State-provided, full-board accommodation will be reduced from the full jobseekers’ rate of €232 per week to €38.80 per week for an adult, subject to an income test, under the plan. There will be a reduced weekly payment of €29.80 for a child. The cuts in payments could mean that as many as 19,000 beneficiaries of temporary protection who arrived during the first two years of the war – and who are not working – will get payments at the same level of allowances as those who have arrived since March this year. A previous Government decision reduced the payments for new Ukrainian arrivals provided with full board accommodation by the State from March 14th. The Government agreed in May to bring in “equivalence of treatment” between beneficiaries of temporary protection who arrived in Ireland before and after March 14th. On Wednesday the Government agreed the implementation plan to give effect to that decision. The measures were contained in a memo brought to Cabinet by Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys and Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman. Around 200 places where Ukrainians are provided with accommodation, food, laundry and other services are to be categorised as Designated Accommodation Centres. Designation of accommodation centres will be effective from September and Ukrainians living in these centres will receive their first reduced payment on Thursday September 12th. Communications are to go out in August to those affected by the expected changes. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said accommodation for international protection applicants should be in better-off areas rather than in communities “that are literally cut to the bone”. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today show, Ms McDonald was outlining her party’s new immigration policy, which she said was distinct from the Government’s approach because “we place not alone human rights and respect for applicants at centre stage, but also respect for and acknowledgment of communities on a par with that. “And our position is that reception centres should not be located in very, very deprived areas. We believe that is the wrong approach. If you look at what the Government has been doing, their approach has been arbitrary. It’s been very much ad hoc and driven by private provision,” she said. “We are for the State providing this accommodation. It hasn’t been planned properly. And in many cases it has meant that facilities have been opened for very vulnerable cohorts of people in communities that are literally cut to the bone and struggling and not managing as things stand.” Ms McDonald said data such as the deprivation index, data from the census and data from the CSO should be used by the Government to inform policy and the choices being made. “What makes the issue of siting of international reception centres really, really, at odds is that that approach is not taken at all. And not alone that, as and when decisions arbitrarily are taken about the siting of centres, there isn’t then an audit even, a dialogue, a structured engagement or consultation with the community. “So our approach ... it is to say simply this: you do not place these centres for very vulnerable cohorts of people who need support in very, very deprived, struggling and neglected areas, by the way, neglected by successive governments and for generations,” Ms McDonald said. “They are not appropriate locations for these as centres and services. We can objectively verify that it shouldn’t be an arbitrary thing where centres are located. Equally, there still has to be a dialogue and engagement and a consultation with the wider community,” she said. “At the heart of our approach, therefore, is community. It’s about living in the real world and recognising people’s lived realities. It’s about getting the system right in a way to protect our social cohesion and to have a system that enjoys public confidence.” Ms McDonald denied this would give communities a veto. She said she did not accept the Government’s rationale that engaging with a community would give them a veto. “I don’t accept that. I think that’s very cynical of them [the Government]. Communities aren’t looking for vetoes. Communities are looking for fair play, for fairness, for common sense, and for their voices to be heard.” The current system for processing applicants was too slow, added Ms McDonald. The average processing time was 18 months and this left the applicant in the “invidious position of being in a very long limbo”.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,False
"Major inquiry into sexual abuse in schools to be recommended by scoping report The scoping inquiry was commissioned last year after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by past pupils A scoping report on historical abuse at boarding and day schools run by religious orders is understood to recommend a statutory inquiry be set up to examine the sexual abuse of potentially thousands of children. The leaders of the Government parties discussed the issue on Tuesday night with the Minister for Education Norma Foley, whose department commissioned the scoping report by senior counsel Mary O’Toole last year. The report, which runs to more than 700 pages, was expected to be discussed by the Cabinet on Wednesday but that was postponed, three people familiar with the issue said. It is expected that officials will continue to work on a plan for publication of the report, and to work with survivors of abuse. It is likely to be approved by the Cabinet and published in September, after which a statutory inquiry is expected to be established. Once an inquiry has been concluded, it is likely that a redress scheme, to be funded at least in part by contributions from the religious order, will be established. The scoping inquiry was instituted last year by Ms Foley after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by a number of past pupils. The allegations first emerged when two brothers, David and Mark Ryan, spoke publicly of being sexually abused by priests at Blackrock College and its affiliate junior school, Willow Park. Both schools were run by the Spiritan congregation, formerly the Holy Ghost Fathers. The brothers first spoke about being sexually abused as boys in the south Dublin secondary school in an RTÉ radio documentary, Blackrock Boys, in 2022. They discovered each other’s abuse only in 2002, many years after it took place. Mark Ryan died last year in London after suffering a suspected heart attack. The documentary led to a wave of revelations and hundreds of survivors reporting they were also abused as boys in schools run by the Spiritans, as well as other congregations who ran day and boarding schools in the past. It later emerged that more than 140 people reported incidences of child sexual abuse involving 18 abusers to gardaí investigating such allegations at the schools in south Dublin. The scoping inquiry was set up by the Department of Education to advise the Government on the nature of the issue and the possible next steps. It was broadened to include allegations of abuse in religious-run boarding and day schools, and received more than 200 submissions. It is understood the report features schools runs by many different religious orders. The report was delivered to Ms Foley in early June.

She said the process had been started by her party colleague Ruairí Quinn when Minister for Education in 2011 but had effectively stalled since he stood down as minister. The Labour leader made the call when responding to the publication of a scoping report which disclosed widespread sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders throughout the State. Speaking before the start of a special parliamentary meeting of her party at the Grand Hotel in Malahide, Ms Bacik also said it was vital that a Redress Scheme be run in parallel with the Commission of Investigation so that survivors are not waiting any longer for justice to be done for them. She also welcomed that the Garda had begun criminal investigations into some of the over 800 alleged abusers identified by victims in 308 schools. “We [need] to look at the divestment of schools from religious orders. For far too long, our school system in Ireland, uniquely in Europe, has been dominated by religious [orders].” She said that over 90 per cent of our primary schools still had religious patronage. “We need to ensure there’s divestment, that we see that the process initiated by Ruairí Quinn is now speeded up and continued, so that religious orders, complicit in such awful horrors in the past, no longer have authority over our schoolchildren in our education system.” She said a core “mission” of the Labour Party was to afford children the right to have an equal future and an equal start. She said in the last redress scheme – in relation to abuse which occurred in religious-run residential settings for children, the orders had not paid their fair share. “Far too many hid behind what we might describe as the developer’s wife system, where their assets were transferred to a trust. What we want to see with this new set of revelations is that the religious orders made to pay their share.” Ms Bacik told reporters it was her view that the Commission should begin its work by looking at the 308 schools included in the scoping inquiry and then extending to look at other schools. She again emphasised the need for a timely redress scheme and said her party was willing to work with the Government to make this happen. She said Minister for Education Norma Foley had worked very closely with other parties during the scoping inquiry and was very respectful of the wishes of survivors throughout the process. Asked if there was a means of ensuring that religious orders paid their share, Ms Bacik said there was nothing illegal about the trust system but there were “serious ethical questions” that had to be asked about why the orders had done so. Asked about the responsibility of the State, she said nobody was suggesting the religious orders should bear 100 per cent responsibility. “Clearly, the State was deeply at fault for failure to regulate, failure to ensure proper governance in schools, for really abdicating responsibility for running and governance of schools and management of schools to religious orders,” she said. Speaking about her party’s preparation for the general election, she said that it had already selected 16 candidates and was buoyed by strong results in the local and European elections. However, she would not put a figure on how many seats the party expected to win, other than to say she wanted to return with more seats than its present six. Ms Bacik said the party would not be involved in a vote transfer agreement with any other party before the general election. “After the election, certainly, we will look to sit down with those parties and representatives who share our vision, our centre left and social democratic values. “We will be looking to form a bloc for negotiations on any programme for Government to make sure that our Labour vision and values form the heart of the next Government.”', 'Major inquiry into sexual abuse in schools to be recommended by scoping report The scoping inquiry was commissioned last year after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by past pupils A scoping report on historical abuse at boarding and day schools run by religious orders is understood to recommend a statutory inquiry be set up to examine the sexual abuse of potentially thousands of children.

Work on preparations for the inquiry by officials, including legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas, will begin shortly and there is also expected to be extensive consultations with survivors of abuse. The proposals were brought to the Government on Tuesday morning by Minister for Education Norma Foley following agreement among the three Coalition party leaders on Monday night. It is understood that the Government intends to set up a Commission of Investigation, in line with the report’s recommendations. Discussions on the terms of reference will take place over the coming weeks, it is expected, but the recommendation from the scoping report is that all types of school should be included, rather than just those run by religious orders. A scoping report into the allegations of abuse at schools run by religious orders – prompted by accounts of abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin, which in turn prompted an outpouring of similar stories – is expected to be published by the Government, perhaps as early as this evening. Ms Foley and her officials have been considering the 700-page report, commissioned last year from senior counsel Mary O’Toole following allegations of historic abuse at Blackrock College. The scoping inquiry conducted by Ms O’Toole included religious-run boarding and day schools, and it is understood that the report features schools run by many different religious orders. Sources say that there may be thousands of cases of sexual abuse in the schools.

It says this should be “informed by the survivor engagement process” which has been part of the scoping inquiry’s work. An advocacy group for victims of sexual abuse in Spiritan schools said the establishment of a redress scheme only after the conclusion of any inquiry would result in “further delays to urgently needed justice”. A statement released by the Restore Together group said any statutory inquiry “must be structured to reflect the urgency of the situation” and by “putting the best interests of victims/survivors first”. The group said this could be done by “the concurrent operation of parallel strands of any inquiry aimed at providing healing, redress and justice”. Survivors received communication from the Government’s Survivor Engagement Lead Kieran McGrath on Tuesday morning informing them a copy of the report would be made available to them before it was published. “We recognise that receiving the Report is significant and that there is likely to be media coverage and discussion of the contents in the coming days. We understand that this may be difficult for you,” Mr McGrath said in an email on Tuesday. He also said that up to six sessions with a qualified counsellor would be made available to any survivor who requested it, with longer term support available from One in Four and other organisations.']",abuse - schools - religious - orders - inquiry - report - survivors - scoping - sexual - redress,1.0,True
"Asylum seekers from Jordan to have their applications processed faster Move follows similar measure to accelerate processing of applicants from Nigeria as Government strives to tackle refugee accommodation crisis Faster processing times are being introduced for international protection applicants from Jordan as and from Monday under plans announced by Minister for Justice Helen McEntee. Some 881 people from Jordan sought asylum in Ireland in the second quarter of 2024, with people from the Middle Eastern state representing the second-highest volume of applications from any origin country in that period. The move follows a similar measure introduced to accelerate the processing of applicants from Nigeria. It comes as the Government continues efforts to get to grips with the refugee accommodation crisis. The State has not been able to accommodate all single adult male asylum seekers since December, with more than 2,400 awaiting an offer of a place to stay as of Friday last. An accelerated system for processing international protection applications from so-called safe countries was introduced in November 2022, with decisions on these to be made within three months. There are 15 “safe” countries of origin on the current list. In April, Ms McEntee added Nigeria to the list to be accelerated, despite it not being classified as a safe country of origin. Jordan, which has been the source of 1,037 international protection applicants in the same period, is also not included on the list of safe countries. Ms McEntee said there has been a 53 per cent drop in applications from people from Nigeria since applicants from the West African country were included among those that get accelerated processing. Accelerated processing now applies to the top-two countries of origin; applicants who have received protection elsewhere in Europe; and the 15 countries on the “safe” list. The 15 “safe countries of origin” are currently: Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Egypt, Georgia, India, Kosovo, Malawi, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Morocco, Serbia and South Africa.

Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,False
"NI election: Sinn Féin now biggest party in Westminster, Stormont and council after DUP losses Alliance makes history with first non-DUP MP in Lagan Valley, while TUV unseats Ian Paisley Sinn Féin has emerged as Northern Ireland’s largest party at Westminster, Stormont and at council level following one of the most dramatic nights in UK election history. For the first time in Northern politics, the nationalist abstentionist party overtook the DUP’s representation in the House of Commons by retaining its seven seats while the DUP dropped to five in what was a crushing defeat that left unionism reeling. Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald urged the new Labour UK prime minister Keir Starmer to “embrace the right of Irish self-determination and constitutional change toward Irish reunification” in the wake of her party’s victory. DUP leader Gavin Robinson appealed for “greater cohesion” among unionists following the poll in which the biggest political upset took place in the DUP heartland of North Antrim with Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister unseating Ian Paisley jnr in a constituency where he and his late father and DUP founder, Rev Ian Paisley, had between them served as MPs for 54 years. The other shock result came hours earlier at 3.40am when the Alliance Party’s Sorcha Eastwood became the first non-unionist MP elected to Lagan Valley in its 40-year history. The 38-year-old is also the first woman to hold the seat that former DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson held for 27 years following her defeat of DUP candidate Jonathan Buckley by almost 3,000 votes. Mr Donaldson did not contest the seat following his controversial departure from the party on Good Friday, when he resigned over sex offence charges. The DUP also lost in South Antrim to former minister for health Robin Swann – with the Ulster Unionists returning an MP to Westminster for the first time since 2017. Sinn Féin deputy leader and Stormont First Minister Michelle O’Neill said her party had achieved a “tremendous result right across the board”. “This speaks volumes that the change is happening – this place is changing,” Ms O’Neill said. East Derry was the last of the 18 constituencies to be declared just before 8am on Friday morning after a recount, with veteran DUP MP Gregory Campbell narrowly retaining the seat by just 179 votes, having seen his previous majority of almost 10,000 slashed. DUP leader Gavin Robinson held his seat in the East Belfast battleground where he went head-to-head with Alliance leader Naomi Long for the fourth time and won with an increased majority of more than 2,500 votes. Describing his victory as a “good result” for the party, Mr Robinson said he was “incredibly proud” of Mr Buckley for running in Mr Donaldson’s former seat, adding that his defeat was a consequence of “divided unionism”. There was a loss for Alliance’s Stephen Farry in North Down who conceded defeat earlier in the night to Independent unionist Alex Easton. Reacting to her landmark victory, Ms Eastwood said: “It’s a fantastic night for us but it’s also a fantastic night for the people of Lagan Valley.” She added: “I’m a Lagan Valley girl born and bred, and this has been in our heart for a long time and I’m just delighted.” One of Sinn Féin’s biggest successes was in Fermanagh and South Tyrone - the most marginal constituency in 2019 with just 57 votes carrying Sinn Féin –  where the party’s new high-profile candidate, Pat Cullen, the former head of the UK’s Royal College of Nursing trade union, secured a majority of over 4,000 votes to win the seat. The nationalist party also retained its seats in Mid Ulster, North Belfast, Newry and Armagh, West Tyrone, West Belfast and South Down. In addition to East Belfast and East Derry, the DUP held Upper Bann, East Antrim and Strangford. The SDLP retained its two seats with party leader Colum Eastwood securing a comfortable win over Sinn Féin’s Sandra Duffy in Foyle – but with a significantly reduced majority of just more than 4,000 votes. Claire Hanna secured 21,345 votes and a majority of more than 12,000 in a landslide victory in South Belfast.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.3739610531378239,False
"South Africa and Botswana citizens will no longer be allowed visa-free travel to Ireland Papers to be required for citizens of both countries as additional measure to address the sharp rise in international protection applicants in 2024  Citizens of Botswana and South Africa will be required to obtain a visa to travel to Ireland from next week under arrangements announced by Minister for Justice Helen McEntee. People who have travelled from either country to Ireland have not until now required visas to enter the State. Both have also been designated as safe countries of origin. The move is being taken in light of what the Department of Justice has described as “a significant number of international protection applications” being received from nationals of Botswana and South Africa. Neither country featured in the top five nationalities of the more than 9,000 people who applied for international protection in the five months to the end of May. Nearly one in three (2,843) applications were made by citizens of Nigeria, followed by Jordan (718), Pakistan (677), Bangladesh (600) and Somalia (586). Less than 500 applications combined were made by people from South Africa and Botswana. Ms McEntee said South Africa and Botswana were the only countries on the safe list that did not require its citizens to obtain visas before travelling to Ireland. “This is a carefully considered decision which will bring Ireland into closer alignment with the Schengen Area in respect of both of these countries, and into line with the UK in respect of South Africa,” she said. “Irish visa requirements are kept under ongoing review, having regard to the need to ensure that effective immigration controls are in place whilst also facilitating those who wish to travel to Ireland for the purposes of a visit, to work, to study, or to join family members.” The Minister said the Dublin visa office would now establish a dedicated “South Africa desk” to process applications from South African nationals. She said the Department of Foreign Affairs would also establish three visa application centres, located throughout South Africa, with visa service provider Global VFS. The Government has introduced a raft of measures and restrictions following a sharp increase in the number of people seeking asylum on arrival into the State. By the end of May, the number of people who had applied for international protection was more than double the total who applied in the same five-month period last year. Among the new measures is an accelerated processing period for those who are citizens of the country that has had the most asylum applications, irrespective of it being designated a safe country of origin. At present, that applies to Nigerian nationals. Some 115 people have been arrested in the first half of this year for arriving without appropriate documentation and a significant number have been convicted. Document checks of people crossing the border from Northern Ireland have also been stepped up as a response to evidence of an increasing number of people using the land and sea route from Britain via Northern Ireland to enter the State.",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,1.0,False
"TDs clamour to contribute to ‘sexy’ subjects in Dáil but fail to attend for ‘workhorse’ legislation, says Ceann Comhairle Ceann Comhairle recalls House as ‘like being on board the Mary Celeste’ because only two parliamentarians attended final debate on important pensions Bill Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl has criticised a growing practice in the Dáil in which TDs clamour to contribute on topical or “sexy” subjects but fail to attend the House for “workhorse” but important legislation. Mr Ó Fearghaíl described one evening in the Dáil as “like being on board the Mary Celeste”, the abandoned and deserted ship, during a debate on automatic pension enrolment legislation. Just two parliamentarians – Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys and himself – were present. “It was an enormously important piece of legislation that will impact positively on so many people, and in gestation for years, and yet when that final stage came up in the Dáil the Minister was there on her own.” He also expressed concern about the extent and quality of debates on legislation, which are more “truncated” than ever, mostly because not enough TDs show up rather than because of a guillotine, or time limit. Mr Ó Fearghaíl was commenting following the start of the summer recess and as he moves towards the end of his second and final term as Ceann Comhairle, or speaker of the Dáil. He will not seek a third term and expects to return to the backbenches after the general election. He said that “when something is topical and in the news and it’s a sexy sort of subject people are very happy to come in and clamour to contribute. But when it’s something like this that’s a workhorse type of initiative with a lot of benefits but not fiercely exciting, we’re not great at turning up.” Expressing concern about the quality of Dáil debates, he compared the Dáil’s consideration of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill to the discussion on the legislation by the Council of State, the advisory group convened by President Michael D Higgins. Mr Ó Fearghaíl said it was “really interesting” to hear the views of council members but “not one of the views expressed at the meeting were reflected in the contributions when the matter was before the Dáil”. He said politicians “need to be more careful in terms of our scrutiny of legislation, how in-depth that scrutiny is” and “the quality of debate that we have”. The Ceann Comhairle said: “I don’t want to be too critical of members. I think they’ve competing demands on their time but I do think that the quality and duration of debate in the House itself is more truncated now than ever before”, mainly because not enough members show up “to thoroughly debate matters”. There is no way to compel attendance “but it is an inescapable fact” that legislation is moving more speedily through plenary sessions of the Dáil than in the past and “there are fewer members contributing”.",-1,-1_northern_uk_dup_stormont,"['northern', 'uk', 'dup', 'stormont', 'posters', 'north', 'return', 'election', 'new', 'dáil']","['Irish unity in ‘touching distance’ after DUP vote, says McDonald Recall of the Assembly to elect Speaker could take place as early as Saturday Irish unity is within “touching distance” as a nationalist First Minister at Stormont is poised to come into office for the first time, according to Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Reacting to the DUP’s endorsement of a deal with the UK government that will end its two-year boycott of the powersharing Executive, Ms McDonald said the elevation of party vice-president Michelle O’Neill to the head of the North’s devolved government will be a moment of “very great significance”. The recall of the Assembly to elect a Speaker could take place as early as Saturday and DUP party leader Jeffrey Donaldson signalled on Tuesday his optimism that there are enough concessions to show that the “naysayers are wrong”. The deal is due to be published on Wednesday and Ms O’Neill said the next number of days are crucial to get the powersharing institutions up and running. Addressing media at Stormont, Ms McDonald alluded to previous political arrangements in Northern Ireland, saying: “I think a Sinn Féin First Minister, and Michelle coming into office as First Minister, for all really is the most striking evidence that that era is now gone; it is now consigned to the pages of the history books. “And more importantly it signals now the new Ireland emerging and the conversation around a new constitutional dispensation, ending partition, Irish unity, all of the opportunity that presents is in many ways embodied in this moment of Michelle O’Neill becoming First Minister here.” Ms McDonald added “I think that the turn of events, the historical turning of the wheel, and the electoral place that we’re at, I think signifies that what we talk about now is possible. “As a matter of fact, in historic terms, it’s within touching distance. And I think that’s a very exciting thing.” The DUP collapsed Stormont in February 2022 when its former first minister Paul Givan quit the executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. Mr Donaldson admitted on Tuesday that they had not secured “everything” they had sought from London in relation to changes to the Windsor Framework deal struck between UK and EU last year. However, he said he had achieved a “good outcome for Northern Ireland” and pledged “zero” checks on goods and paperwork works destined for the North - through the “green lane” element of the Windsor Framework – from Britain. “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer be physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told reporters outside Stormont. Asked about a timeline for Stormont’s return, he said it was conditional upon the UK government “delivering on their side” but that he hoped it will happen quickly. DUP party discipline remained tight on Tuesday after Monday evening’s DUP executive meeting led to an internal party inquiry when details of Mr Donaldson’s briefing to 130 members were leaked by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. Mr Bryson live tweeted details in what he claimed was a “blow by blow account” of the five-hour meeting. Despite Mr Donaldson’s claims on Tuesday that there will be legal changes to the post-Brexit deal, Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris played down the prospect of fresh negotiations with the EU and said that “all conditions are now in place” for a return of the Executive. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was adamant that the Windsor Framework deal will not be changed “one sentence” and that the so-called Irish Sea Border will “still be there”. Mr Beattie expressed concern that the situation could “unravel” in coming days if the Assembly is not restored by Monday. Alliance Party Leader Naomi Long told reporters it was a “bittersweet” day in that there was nothing in the DUP deal with the UK that “wasn’t available in 2018 under Theresa May”.', 'UK government publishes deal which will set stage for Stormont return Safeguarding the Union document was released online by the UK government on Wednesday  The text of the legislation which secured the DUP’s return to power-sharing in the North has been published. The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was released online by the UK government on Wednesday afternoon. The measures outlined in the document by the UK government include, as previously signalled, legislation “affirming Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the Union” and which amends the UK Internal Market Act 2020 to “guarantee Northern Ireland’s unfettered access to the UK’s internal market.” It will also end dynamic alignment with EU law. Legislative change will “recognise the end of the automatic pipeline of EU law”; Section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will be amended, “reflecting the new reality that the law which applies in Northern Ireland is now properly subject to the democratic oversight of the Northern Ireland Assembly through the Stormont Brake and the democratic consent mechanism.” The so-called Green Lane will be replaced with a UK internal market system, and the UK government “will commit that more than 80 per cent of all freight movements from Great Britain to Northern Ireland take place under the UK internal market system, with independent scrutiny.” This will ensure “there will be no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks.” There will be a legal requirement that new legislation will be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and, if so, for ministers to make a statement considering any impacts on the operation of Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s internal market.” The document includes more than 20 provisions, which includes the creation of an Independent Monitoring Panel to “provide oversight of the implementation of new arrangements”, the creation of a UK East-West Council and the publication of operational arrangements for the Stormont Brake. The UK government will also “pursue an agreement with the EU on a long-term basis” to ensure the continued supply of necessary veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland beyond 2025. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said  before it was published that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. His party has been using a veto power to block Stormont’s devolved institutions for almost two years in protest at the post-Brexit arrangements that have created trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. However, Mr Donaldson announced earlier this week that his party was prepared to return to Stormont, dependent on the UK government implementing the various legislative assurances and other measures it has offered. This is expected to lead to the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland within days and will see Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill become the North’s first ever nationalist first minister. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons on Wednesday. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return,” he said on Tuesday. The return of Stormont will also see the Treasury release a £3.3 billion package to support under-pressure public services in Northern Ireland. The financial package includes money to settle the demands of striking public sector workers in the region this year. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Mr Donaldson said the deal would represent a “significant change” in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit’s so-called Irish Sea border. He said: “On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. “On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.” Sinn Féin has focused on the imminent return of the Stormont Assembly, with party leader Mary Lou McDonald stating that Irish unity is now within “touching distance” as she hailed the significance of her party assuming the role of Stormont first minister for the first time. Ms McDonald said the expected appointment of Ms O’Neill in the coming days would be a moment of “very great significance”. Mr Donaldson announced his support for a Stormont return after receiving the “decisive” backing of the 130-strong party executive during a five-hour meeting on Monday night. He said DUP party officers, a key 12-strong decision-making body, had also “mandated” him to move forward on the basis he was proposing. Support for the deal is not unanimous within the DUP and several senior figures remain opposed to the proposed agreement. - PA', 'Northern Ireland has reached a turning point, with its volatile politics set to play out on a new pitch If much of the past decade has been consumed by Brexit and its catastrophic fallout, constitutional change looks set to dominate the next one Saturday, February 3rd, 2024. In years to come, much will be made of the significance of this day. It says much about the stop-start nature of politics in Northern Ireland that the restoration of the political institutions – the Assembly and the Executive set up in 1998 as a result of the Belfast Agreement – is not where history is being made. Most people in Northern Ireland would tell you they are glad to see Stormont up and running again, but it has been only four years since the last time it was resurrected. The depressing statistic is that since the formation of that first Assembly, it has been in limbo for longer than it has been operational. It is easy to imagine the professors of the future speeding past this two-year hiatus in their lectures, perhaps explaining it only to make a wider point about the catastrophic impact of Brexit on the delicate political balance in Northern Ireland. Those professors might teach about how the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union reawakened and reinvigorated the conversation around a united Ireland and how it pushed the topic into mainstream politics, and how this all took place against a backdrop of a changing society. If 50 or 100 years hence, their students note down today’s date, it is because it marks a turning point: the first time in the North’s history that a nationalist, not a unionist, has been at the head of government. To turn to the history books again, this is significant because this was never supposed to happen. The “boast” of the first prime minister of Northern Ireland, James Craig, was that “we are a Protestant parliament and Protestant state”. This was a status quo that was preserved by discrimination and gerrymandering until it all went up in the conflagration that was the Troubles. We are still living with the consequences. Parliament Buildings, Craig’s pride and joy, opened in 1932. He could simply never have envisaged the scenario whereby one day unionists would no longer be in the majority and instead, a Sinn Féin first minister would take what he saw as their place. Northern Ireland is, of course, much changed since those days, and even since 1998, when that first powersharing government was led by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble as first minister and Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as deputy first minister. Now Sinn Féin is knocking at the door of the “hat-trick”, as Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool puts it: it is the largest party at local council level, at Assembly level and at Westminster, where an election is expected this year. The tally of seats in the House of Commons between the North’s two main parties stands at seven to eight to the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The 2021 census showed that, for the first time, there were more people from a Catholic background than a Protestant one in Northern Ireland, and the number of people who do not regard themselves as having any religion is growing; politically, roughly 20 per cent of votes now go to parties that identify neither as unionist nor nationalist but as other, as demonstrated above all by the recent success of Alliance. Today’s milestone in reality came two years ago, immediately after the May 2022 election, when Sinn Féin returned as the largest party with the largest number of seats, entitling its vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, to the position of first minister. This is a joint office, with, in practice, the same powers as the deputy first minister; one cannot govern without the other. Yet this is a place where names – and symbols – matter. When O’Neill takes to her feet on Saturday and speaks in the chamber as first minister, the moment comes wrapped up in 100 years of symbolism. Advocates of a united Ireland, not least Sinn Féin, will inevitably see it as another step along that path. It is “within touching distance”, as Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald put it this week. James Craig will turn quietly in his marble tomb only a few hundred yards from Parliament Buildings. From Sinn Féin’s point of view, what will make the moment all the sweeter is that it is viewed, at least in part, as coming at the DUP’s own hand. If Brexit was the initial act of self-harm, then the two years of stalemate as the health service imploded, public services collapsed and Northern Ireland was brought to a virtual standstill by strike action did nothing to make the case that the place was working. Lawyer and unionist commentator Sarah Creighton wrote in the Guardian this week that “there will be no champagne corks popped across Northern Ireland ... Most, I expect, will get on with their lives with weary resignation.” Rather than the DUP “celebrating this breakthrough, it should be apologising for the lives it has ruined.” In a hotel function room in the early hours of Tuesday morning, DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced to the few who were still up that, depending on the UK government holding up its end of the deal, the party would end its boycott of the Stormont institutions and go back in. It was altogether underwhelming, the final act in a tragedy that had already dragged on far too long. There was no sense of a big breakthrough, more that the DUP had finally bowed to the inevitable. “They simply ran out of road,” was the line repeated over and over in conversations this week. Donaldson had been preparing the ground for a return for some time, as demonstrated by his party conference speech in October, when he outlined his support for devolution. In the end, what it came down to was political courage, the conviction to face down his opponents – from within and without – and persuade them a return to Stormont was the only viable option. The key here was winning the support of Edwin Poots, briefly DUP leader and one of the party’s “big beasts”. His backing for Donaldson last week was the clincher, giving the leader a majority among the party’s 12-person officer team. Ever the pragmatist, Poots described the deal reached this week with the UK government as a “significant milestone” but there was “further work to be done. “We’re not settled at this as a finish; it gives us enough to move on from the tactic that was utilised to force change, which wasn’t forthcoming, but that tactic has come to an end for now and we’ll be working with His Majesty’s Government on other issues,” he said. That tactic has done its work. The DUP’s boycott did secure changes to post-Brexit trading arrangements, as evidenced by the replacement of the Northern Ireland protocol with the Windsor framework and, though a trade border still remains in the Irish Sea, they have succeeded with this new agreement in removing most checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. Whether it has secured the place of Northern Ireland within the UK remains to be seen, regardless of all 80 pages of reassurance published by the UK government under the title Safeguarding the Union. That this should be deemed necessary belies an underlying fear over the vulnerability of that union. From his point of view, Donaldson has played this well, both in terms of the concessions he has won from the UK government and, a few dissenters aside, in managing to keep his party with him as they return to Stormont. Others would question whether this two-year hiatus was necessary in the first place, and for all the DUP would argue it has gained, there is much that has been lost. “We’re seeing people in A&E for actual days now ... years ago, if you breached the four-hour wait, everybody was horrified. Now it’s just firefighting the whole time,” said social worker and union representative Deborah Yapicioz ahead of mass strike action last month. Although the problems with the health service started long before the DUP walked out of the Executive, this is a snapshot of the extent of the challenges incoming ministers are facing. For all the apparent permanence of that big building looking down from the top of the hill, after every collapse, the principles of powersharing, and democracy itself, are further eroded. In a political vacuum, alternatives emerge; be they violent – as Northern Ireland knows to its cost – or constitutional: direct rule from London, joint authority or a united Ireland. Stormont was and is the compromise, and the only way for unionism to keep Northern Ireland in the union for the long term is the very opposite of the last two years – to make it work. Of all the symbolism that will swirl around Michelle O’Neill as she takes office as first minister, it signifies above all that politics in Northern Ireland is being played on a new pitch. If the conversation of the past 10 years has been Brexit, constitutional change will be that of the next decade.']",northern - uk - dup - stormont - posters - north - return - election - new - dáil,0.0,False
"Hundreds of mother and baby home survivors receive first redress payments Landmark scheme was finally opened in March after delays and criticism  More than 450 survivors of mother and baby institutions have been given payments as part of a new redress scheme which opened for applications in March. Under the scheme, the roll-out of which was delayed a number of times, more than €7 million has been paid out so far, with the average payment standing at approximately €15,500. Up until mid-July, some 4,375 applications were received and nearly 3,500 of these are considered completed and are being processed. If an application is considered incomplete, officials from a dedicated payment office provide support, such as help with organising the necessary documentation. Some 34,000 women and children who were in the institutions over many decades are estimated to be eligible to qualify for the financial payments. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Justice for Magdalenes Research and Clann Project groups have already criticised the limitations of the scheme. The scheme pays compensation to mothers who had to spend time in mother and baby institutions and also those children who spent more than six months there. Much of the criticism of the redress plans centres around the exclusion of people who spent less than six months in the institutions. The Government has defended the €800 million scheme,  saying it is the largest of its type. Information on the first payments and decisions was given to Independent TD Catherine Connolly by  Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman,  who told Ms Connolly that overall, the Department of Children has “received positive feedback that applicants are finding the application process straightforward and the information line helpful”. Decisions on payments or “notices of determination” have now issued in 1,784 cases. Applicants are  given six months to accept an offer if one  is made. For this reason, “the timeframe between the issuing of notices of determination and payments being made will be dependent upon applicants and how long each wishes to take to consider their award”, Mr O’Gorman said. Once an award is accepted, the payment office processes the agreed amount. To date, 508 awards have been accepted by applicants and 459 of those have already been paid, with an average payment of just under €15,500. Total payments to date total €7.1 million. “Approximately half of these applicants were also deemed eligible for health supports under the payment scheme, ie the enhanced medical card or for those living outside of Ireland, the once-off health support payment valued at €3,000,” Mr O’Gorman said. Ms Connolly also sought details on the number of appeals since the scheme was opened earlier this year. She was told some 134 applicants have sought a review of the decision  that was issued to them. “This number includes all applications where no award was offered and where applicants have queried the award offered. Reviews are processed in a separate administrative channel within the payment scheme office,” the Minister said. He said  an “extensive information awareness campaign” is under way both in Ireland and abroad. “Here in Ireland, a number of channels are being employed, including national radio and print ads, local radio and print ads, paid social media activity, digital ads, as well as on-the-ground elements such as poster drops to libraries and community centres. Similar activity, apart from radio advertising, is also under way in Britain, USA and Australia, including in-person events led by my officials in England recently.”",1,1_people_accommodation_asylum_state,"['people', 'accommodation', 'asylum', 'state', 'countries', 'protection', 'international', 'seekers', 'mcentee', 'eu']","['Proportion of single men among asylum seekers fell sharply in final weeks of 2023 Decline came as State ran out of capacity to offer beds to the cohort The proportion of single men among asylum seekers arriving in Ireland declined sharply in the final weeks of last year as the State ran out of capacity to offer beds to this cohort of migrants. Meanwhile, separate figures show that the number of Ukrainian refugees who sought temporary protection in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 has almost halved compared with the same period in 2022. The data comes as the Cabinet signed off on plans to cut the welfare payments that future arrivals from Ukraine will be entitled to with legislation due to come before the Dáil to do this as early as next week. There is significant pressure on Ireland’s system for housing refugees from Ukraine and those seeking international protection (IP) from other countries. There have been local protests against planned accommodation centres for single men, most recently in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. For the final week in December, figures compiled by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) show just 29 per cent of arriving asylum seekers were single males. While this was still the largest single group, it is significantly down on recent months. For both September and October, half of those arriving into the State were single males, and in November, it was 43 per cent. Figures published on December 10th show that in the preceding week, single men made up 54 per cent of arrivals, but the figure rapidly dropped off as the month progressed. The Government confirmed on December 4th it could not provide accommodation. Government sources believe the drop-off is likely in part down to word of mouth about the accommodation crisis facing single men applying for international protection here. In early December, the Government confirmed it was no longer in a position to offer single men accommodation amid a nationwide shortage. The trends in the prevalence of men arriving are similar to the last period when the State could not offer accommodation, during the first months of 2023. In January of last year, 50 per cent of arrivals were in this category but this dropped as low as 35 per cent before the Department of Integration sourced new accommodation and was able to offer beds again. The Department of Integration published new figures on Tuesday showing 512 male asylum seekers have now been left without accommodation due to the shortage of places for asylum seekers. A total of 579 people were unable to be accommodated, at least initially, since the start of December; 67 were subsequently offered places to stay. Those who are not being offered accommodation are being given an increased weekly payment of €113.80 and being referred to drop-in centres run by two homelessness charities. Separately, newly released figures show the number of Ukrainian refugees who arrived in Ireland in the last two months of 2023 is almost half the number who came here in the same period in 2022. Department of Justice figures show that 4,594 people from Ukraine sought temporary protection in Ireland between October 30th, 2023 and the end of the year. That is a drop of almost 48 per cent on the 8,806 Ukrainian refugees who arrived during the same two months in 2022. The figures for the first week of January are likely to be down on the previous year as well. The Government will move to introduce legislation as early as next week to cut the social welfare entitlements of Ukrainian refugees who come to Ireland in future, Ministers were told at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys briefed colleagues on the details of the legislative changes that will be required to reduce weekly welfare payments from €232 per week to under €39. The Government says the changes are necessary as current arrangements are “unsustainable”. More than 100,000 people from Ukraine have fled to Ireland since Russia invaded their home country in 2022. But a Government spokesman was unable to say what level of weekly arrivals would be sustainable. “There is no target for how many numbers of Ukrainians we expect to arrive as a result of the changes,” he said. Nonetheless, it is anticipated in Government that the number of arrivals will drop due to the changes.

Ms McEntee said Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys is looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, saying the move is based on a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. The means-testing would apply to the daily expenses allowances distributed to people 18 years or over living in direct provision and international protection settings. The advice comes amid concerns that some asylum seekers in employment are still claiming allowances. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in State-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year. Ms McEntee told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme on Friday: “That’s really to bring everybody in line to make sure that those who are here, those who have access to work, those who are available to provide for themselves, that they can provide for themselves. That’s why these payments are changing.” Asked whether the Government has assessed “what you’re dealing with” before implementing the policy, Ms McEntee said: “This has nothing to do with the numbers. “What we’re saying is that if a person is working – and this applies to anyone in the system, this isn’t just for those of international protection or those coming from Ukraine – if a person is working and a person has the means to provide themselves, to fund themselves, to house themselves, then they shouldn’t be getting higher level of State intervention or funding, and that applies to anybody in this country,” Ms McEntee said. “We need to make sure that our rules are fair, and that they apply across the board. This is not about how many we can take out of the system. This is about making sure that we have a fair system that applies to people equally across the board.” International protection applicants living in State-provided accommodation are entitled to an allowance of €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. Those without accommodation and on a waiting list for a place to stay receive an increased adult rate of €113.80 per week. There are currently 30,463 people seeking international protection and living in State provided accommodation, including 7,494 children. Some 1,923 men are awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to Government data.  Speaking at a local elections event in Monaghan on Friday, Mary Lou McDonald said that means testing is “part and parcel” of the welfare system. “It seems to me consistent that it would apply in this case,” the Sinn Féin leader said.  Ms McDonald said people have been asking questions about immigration while she has been canvassing. “I don’t think anybody should be surprised by that. When a change comes to your country or communities, people aren’t going to ask questions,” she said. “I know people have been shocked by sights of tents on Mount Street, tents by the Grand Canal in Dublin, and rightly shocked by that. “The thing that people are most frustrated by, most shocked by, is the fact that the Government has failed to have any plan. The fact that the Government has failed to have any effective communication or consultation with local communities, and that’s caused a problem. “I think that could have been avoided. I think it should have been avoided. I think we could have avoided much of the stress and strain that has happened. “We’ve told people that what we need is a system that is fair, that is efficient, and that’s enforced, a rules-based system. “Let me tell you, I’ve been on doors now all around the place and... that’s in my opinion, where the vast, vast, vast majority of Irish people are at, a system that is fair, that’s efficient. “We need a Government that can plan and that can manage things and doesn’t leave everybody in the worst of all worlds.” – PA', 'New measures aimed at asylum seekers from ‘safe’ countries could result in 5,000 applicants leaving State Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has added Algeria and Botwana to the ‘safe’ country list and disclosed that Nigeria and Pakistan were  considered but were not deemed ‘safe’ Strict new measures targeted at people from ‘safe’ countries who seek asylum in Ireland will lead to a potential removal of up to 5,000 people from the State, Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said. Ms McEntee announced on Tuesday that two new countries – Botswana and Algeria – have been added to the safe country list, bringing to 10 the number of countries in that category. She also disclosed that the Government had considered adding Nigeria and Pakistan to the list of safe countries, but concluded they did not meet all the criteria. The Minister has also brought in an additional measure, where people who have already been granted International Protection (IP) in another EU State will go through an expedited procedure in Ireland, on the grounds their application is inadmissible. A person who has been granted protection in one EU State cannot subsequently seek protection in another EU State. Ms McEntee said that there were between 1,800 to 2,000 people in the IP system at present who had already been granted protection in the EU. She said that those people had been identified through the Eurodac information system as well as through the various checks at the ports of entry, which show they have status in another country. Every applicant seeking asylum has their fingerprints taken, and that is checked against the EU-wide Eurodac system to see if they applied for protection elsewhere. “When you take [the safe country designation of] Botswana, Algeria and this particular process into play, you’re potentially looking at 5,000 people in the system. We’re trying to take people out of the system here that should not be in it, that are taking up space for those who genuinely need protection,” she said. The Minister was speaking outside Government Buildings on Tuesday afternoon following the meeting of the Cabinet.  Ms McEntee said that her Department looked at a range of criteria when considering if a country is safe, including consistent inhumane or degrading treatment, if there was a war ongoing, or if people’s lives were essentially at risk. “We reviewed four countries in this instance. For two of those, Pakistan and Nigeria, a decision was taken that we could not say that they were safe countries. For the other two, Algeria and Botswana. I’m very confident in the process that has been undertaken. “We have seen an increase in people coming from those countries and the vast majority are coming for economic reasons. It’s important to stress that this does not mean people coming from any of the 10 safe countries cannot seek international protection. They can apply, but they will be processed in a much quicker way. Their decisions will be given in a much quicker timeline. And if they have a negative decision, they will be asked to leave, where they will be supported to leave in a much quicker way than what we’ve seen in the past year.” She said that since the decision was taken to put countries designated as safe into an accelerated process – where decisions are taken within weeks – there has been a decrease of 40 per cent in applications from people from those countries. She said 80 per cent of the applications were refused and, on appeal, 80 per cent of decisions were upheld. She said that the appeal process was also taking place within a much shorter time frame of four to five months, thanks to a significant increase of staff. “It sends a very clear message that the International Protection system is here for people who genuinely need protection. It should never be used as a back way or a separate route for economic migration. Ms McEntee said the authorities had seen a sharp increase in the number of people coming from Algeria, which was the fourth highest country of origin at present. Asked about other Government Ministers expressing views that 15,000 asylum seekers each year was the “new normal”, Ms McEntee said she did not have any overall objective in relation to numbers, other than to ensure an efficient and effective immigration system. “We went from having around 3,000 applications a year post-Covid. Now it’s closer to 12,000 to 13,000 people a year. That is reflected right across the EU, and right across the globe. There are millions of people on the move. We need to make sure that we have as efficient and effective a system in place as possible to be able to respond to those demands.” The 10 countries now designated as safe by the Irish Government are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia, South Africa, Botswana and Algeria.']",people - accommodation - asylum - state - countries - protection - international - seekers - mcentee - eu,0.8514342653931674,False
"Mary Lou McDonald reflects on ‘very tough year’ as she reveals husband’s cancer diagnosis  Sinn Féin leader in mourning following her father’s recent death but her husband Martin Lanigan’s prognosis is now positive Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has spoken about her husband’s cancer diagnosis for the first time, describing a “very eventful and a very tough year”. In an interview on Virgin Media TV’s Ireland AM, she said her husband Martin Lanigan was diagnosed with colorectal cancer during a family trip to France. “Life just throws curveballs at you and, in my case, several of them happened at one time,” she said, describing how she herself had only just recovered from a hysterectomy in June 2023. “Thank God I had recovered really well from that. I thought, great, here we go. We went on a short family break, and literally between packing the case to come home and arriving at the airport, Martin got really, really sick,” she said. It was “one of those moments in life where literally everything got turned upside down”, but his prognosis is now positive. “We buried my father five weeks ago. So anybody who has lost their dad knows that’s a very hard thing. It’s a complete game-changer,” she said, adding: “I’m doing okay”. Mr McDonald died “peacefully in the wonderful care of Caritas Nursing Home on Merrion Road” on July 29th, according to his death notice on RIP.ie. The past year had been “very eventful and very tough,” she said. “Sometimes that just happens in life, right? You know, one thing happens and then another thing happens.” Asked about the general election and the threat of the far right to Sinn Féin’s hopes of forming a government , Ms McDonald said: “I think the concern [is] around the very small number of toxic agitators who don’t really care about communities . . . I think they need to be faced down. Our job is to connect [with communities], reconnect, set out our stall”. On the party’s new housing policy, she said: “People said to us very clearly, we want concrete [policies]. And we heard that loud and clear”. The party has pledged to spend €39 billion on housing over the next five years to deliver 300,000 homes, if the party is elected to government. “We have launched last week a hugely comprehensive, five-year, fully-costed, fully-deliverable plan.

Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.3872062888688482,False
"Sinn Féin set to select new general secretary at upcoming ardfheis Long-time party activist Ken O’Connell announces his intention to leave the job Sinn Féin is set to select a new general secretary after the current holder of the role, long-time party activist Ken O’Connell, announced his intention to leave the job. Mr O’Connell (68) told party members he would not take up his nomination to stand for the ardrúnaí role at the Sinn Féin ardfheis later this month. He told The Irish Times his decision was not related to Sinn Féin’s recent slide in opinion polls, that he is leaving the job as he is “not getting any younger”, it is “time for new blood” and “I think change is good”. He said he hopes to take up another role in the party. Originally from Co Wicklow, Mr O’Connell became involved full time with Sinn Féin around the time of the hunger strikes in 1981. Serving as general secretary since 2020, Mr O’Connell was the party’s 26-county political director for around a decade before that. In a communication to Sinn Féin members he said he would give his “full support” to whoever is elected as his successor. He highlighted how it is an “important time for our party as we face into a general election in the 26 counties. This follows on the heels of our very successful and historic elections in the North under Michelle O’Neill’s leadership as ‘First Minister for All’.” He urged Sinn Féin members to become “more active than ever before” in the lead up to the general election in the South. He said the party had launched an “ambitious” housing plan, and also set out its affordable childcare proposals. “I firmly believe that with Sinn Féin in government North and South, and under Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald TD, this truly represents new leadership for a new Ireland – one that puts working people first, makes our society a better place to raise a family and unites our country in harmony and friendship.”",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Sinn Féin would spend €1bn of Apple windfall on investment in working class communities - McDonald Targeted capital investment could ‘transform communities’ suffering from neglect, party leader said Sinn Féin would spend €1 billion of the Apple tax windfall upfront on investment in working class communities, the party said today at its annual think-in ahead of the new Oireachtas term. Speaking to TDs, Senators and election candidates at the traditional pre-term meeting of the parliamentary party, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said that an Equality for Communities Fund would provide “targeted capital investment” for sports, play, youth, community and arts facilities as well as public spaces. In her keynote address, she said it would “transform communities impacted by generation after generation of neglect and cuts”. Ms McDonald said that the €1 billion fund for social investment funded by the Apple tax payments would be targeted according to Pobal deprivation data.  She said there would be a “wider conversation” on what should be done with the remainder of the money, but amid reports that the current coalition is planning to pre-commit large amounts to infrastructural spending, she warned: “I don’t think this government should be getting presumptuous about that. We need to think about that. We need to invest that very, very thoughtfully.” The Dublin Central TD said that Sinn Féin election candidates would be expected to work hard and connect with their community, as well as share a Republican commitment to a united Ireland. Asked about polling which suggested her party would command less than one in five rural voters’ first preferences in an election, Ms McDonald said the local and European votes in June had seen the electorate give a message to Sinn Féin “loud and clear”. She said that the party was now presenting its policies across a range of areas and would keep advocating for them in the interests of urban and rural dwellers. Earlier in the day, in an interview with RTÉ's Morning Ireland, she said that people who abused the party’s candidates on the doorsteps during the last local election campaign were the same individuals seen “cavorting with very, very vicious loyalist elements” in Belfast during the summer. A number of far-right agitators from Dublin attended an anti-immigration rally in Belfast last month that descended into violence. Some of the Dublin activists – who refer to themselves as “Irish patriots” online – appeared at the Belfast protest holding Tricolours alongside members of the loyalist community brandishing union flags. Sinn Féin politicians had been activists in local communities for a very long time she said, adding: “We’re not Johnny come latelys to any of this.” There was, she said, a concerted effort online to “come at Sinn Féin” during the election campaign. “The only thing I could conclude from the whole thing is that those who were shouting all of this abuse fundamentally don’t want change, fundamentally they want the status quo, fundamentally they don’t want all of the things that are better for our communities.” Her party planned to run about 70 candidates in the next general election she said.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

"Dáil returns: Febrile, fretful and intensely competitive few weeks lie ahead With an election on the horizon, politicians are focused on their constituencies and the relentless competition for votes TDs return to Leinster House on Wednesday for what many expect to be the final few weeks of the 33rd Dáil. Whenever it comes, the reality is that both parties and individual politicians are in election mode now. That will make the coming term even more febrile, fretful and intensely competitive than the last one. Faced with the prospect of electoral mortality, politicians will be living on their nerves. It’s possible, though, to envisage a number of themes and questions that will inevitably surface in the coming weeks. Already debate is dominated by the forthcoming budget. The Government will have a lot of money to spend, and it is already clearly signalling aspects of the great giveaway. There is already fierce competition between the three Government parties to claim credit for aspects of the budget. And although that has the advantage for them of squeezing out the Opposition, it won’t do anything for relations within the Coalition that are looking increasingly frayed. And there’s nearly two weeks of hard negotiations left within Government. During that time, watch Sinn Féin seek to elbow itself into the political conversation. That party – and its leader – have endured a difficult year, with pressure piled on by tumbling poll numbers. But in recent weeks the shape of an aggressive “back to basics” campaign is emerging with a strong focus on housing pushed through a familiar left-populist critique of the current Government. It’s worked before. Whether it can work again is one of the chief political questions of the pre-election election. In the Dáil, once the budget is presented on October 1st, the Government will soon afterwards introduce the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill to give effect to many of the measures. How quickly that is done will be a firm indicator of a likely 2024 election; normally the Finance Bill would be cleared by the Cabinet a few weeks after the budget. Sources now say it could go to Cabinet the following week, and be tabled in the Dáil shortly afterwards. There will be other important Bills in the Dáil. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has told his Cabinet colleagues that the mammoth planning Bill will be passed by the middle of October – a significant step, the Government hopes, in speeding up the planning process in order to deliver more houses. Likely the parliamentary guillotine – a motion that ends the debate and completes the Bill if passed – will be used. The Government also intends to bring the Defamation Bill to the Dáil. This may not be completed, but its second-stage debate will give Government TDs and Ministers an opportunity to recall the large number of Sinn Féin TDs who have taken defamation proceedings against the media, including Mary Lou McDonald, who is suing RTÉ. Expect the hate crime Bill – probably in heavily amended form – also to make the list of “things that have to be done”. But in truth, legislative affairs will be pretty far down most people’s agendas. Whether the election comes in November or early next year, politicians in all parties are now focused on their constituencies and the relentless competition for votes under way everywhere. “I’d prefer to be at home canvassing,” one confessed at his think-in. In the US, the presidential race will be decided by a handful of states; in the UK, many Westminster seats are safe for one party or another. But Irish elections are intensely competitive in every constituency and frequently decided by wafer-thin margins of a few hundred votes or fewer. Politicians know that every door knocked on increases their chances of winning – voters are quite receptive to being asked personally for their vote. That reality will overhang politics in the coming term.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,1.0,False
"Stripping back of hate crime legislation was inevitable but marks a dark day for targeted communities Politically, the move forward will inevitably be construed as a clearing of the decks in advance of an election The news that the Government is to strip controversial elements from its hate crime legislation was, in some ways, inevitable. First of all: what is happening? The Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022 had a relatively uneventful passage through the Dáil, culminating in April 2023. However, since then, a range of criticisms have emerged, including around the prohibition of incitement to violence or hatred – which makes up part two of the Bill as passed by the Dáil, and which creates a range of offences. The Government has been accused of “playing to the woke gallery”, with opposition coming from across the political spectrum – and indeed from overseas, where even Elon Musk has weighed in. This gathered pace after the shellacking of the family and care referendums in March, with Government TDs and Sinn Féin reversing ferret on the legislation and calling for it to be radically overhauled, or dropped entirely. Since then, it has been in a sort of legislative limbo, with the Government promising amendments in the Seanad to soothe concerns – but without saying exactly what it will do. Now we know. Earlier this summer, Helen McEntee quietly received approval from Coalition leaders to remove the parts of the Bill that deal with incitement to violence and hatred, and proceed only with the elements that deal with hate crime. So, it will still provide for higher prison sentences for certain crimes where it is proven that the motivation is hatred or hatred is demonstrated. Assault or damage to property can be aggravated by hatred and there will be tougher prison sentences for this, and if hatred is not proven, a conventional charge can be brought. Old laws dealing with the prohibition of incitement to hatred, dating to 1989, will remain in force. Government sources said on Friday that where people are targeted because of who they are, perpetrators will get higher prison sentences. “We have to stamp out the sort of vile racist attacks we have seen on our streets, and on our television screens, and higher prison sentences is part of that,” one said. But the underlying reality is that the political threshold for proceeding with the Bill in its original form is not reachable. A Coalition source conceded: “While there was significant consensus in the Dáil for hate speech laws, with proposals from the Opposition to expand the law further, that consensus was lost.” The Government will assure victims that they are “determined to stamp out hate motivated crimes” and to protect vulnerable communities from hatred being incited against them, and the justice committee may look at the issue again – but that will be cold comfort to those who were hoping for more. Critics of the Bill will take this as a win, although hanging issues remain – including the inclusion of the term “transgender” and the phrase “a gender other than those of male and female”. This skirmish in the culture war may have some way to play out. For communities targeted because of who they are, it will be a dark day despite any pleas in mitigation offered by the Government, and they are unlikely to hold back with criticism. Politically, the move forward will inevitably be construed as a clearing of the decks in advance of an election. The Government will say it has achieved the art of the possible, and that may be a credible defence, but it also illustrates how certain things end up being expendable in the face of cold, hard, political realities.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend.

It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Hate crime Bill to retain special protections for transgender and non-binary people  Elements relating to hate speech to be shelved but gender definitions to remain despite opposition questioning idea of legislating for ‘multiplicity of subjective genders’ The slimmed-down hate crime Bill will retain special protections for transgender and non-binary people, the Department of Justice has said. The Government has confirmed that it intends to shelve the controversial hate speech elements of the Bill but the hate crime legislation – which provides for tougher sentences for crimes such as assault that are motivated by hatred – is expected to be brought to the Dáil in the coming weeks. A spokeswoman for Minister for Justice Helen McEntee confirmed to The Irish Times on Tuesday that the definitions of gender contained in the original Bill would remain. Unease over these aspects of the Bill among backbenchers was one of the things that caused the Government to rethink its approach. Anti-discrimination laws have established “protected characteristics” – race, colour, nationality, religion, national or ethnic origin, descent, gender, sex characteristics, sexual orientation and disability – and those protections are extended in the hate crime legislation. The legislation provides for tougher sentences for crimes which show hatred motivated by these protected characteristics. The proposed law extends the definition of gender to include, “the gender of a person or the gender which a person expresses as the person’s preferred gender, or with which the person identifies, and includes transgender and a gender other than those of male and female”. Leading a revolt against the legislation in the Seanad last year, Senator Michael McDowell asked “what is intended by the term ‘transgender’ and the phrase ‘a gender other than those of male and female’?”. The Department of Justice supplied no response. There is some disquiet among Government TDs about being pitched into a debate about how many genders there are. However, confirming that these definitions would remain in the Bill, the department said on Tuesday: “If someone is assaulted because they are transgender, that is a hate crime.” “People identify as non-binary. That’s a fact. If someone follows a non-binary person after they leave a gay nightclub, and then assaults them while shouting homophobic abuse, they would likely be charged with assault causing harm aggravated by hatred (carrying a max sentence of 12 years, instead of 10 years because of the aggravating factor). If it’s not found that it has been aggravated by hatred, then the person could still be charged with assault causing harm,” it said. “A definition is required to protect that person. It has absolutely no implications outside of this law.” The department also asked: “Does Michael McDowell believe that this person should be protected by this law, or does he believe this person should have to identify as male or female to be protected?” However, speaking to The Irish Times, Mr McDowell said: “The Bill suggests that there are genders (plural) other than male or female. It does not enumerate or describe such other genders.” Mr McDowell said that the law – in the Gender Recognition Act, which allows people to legally change their gender – currently recognised two genders. He said the Constitution also adopted a binary attitude, citing the Irish language text: “cibé acu is fir nó mná iad”. “If the Government wishes to provide heavier punishment for victims of crime committed because they are victimised as transgender, let them simply say that. There is no problem with doing so. There is no case or need for creating a multiplicity of unspecified subjective statuses described as genders,” he said. Mr McDowell also said that unspecified genders would raise questions “over statutory provisions providing for gender balance in judicial appointments, board compositions, etc”. “There is no case for legislating for an open-ended multiplicity of subjective genders the meaning of which is obscure,” he said.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons. Keep track of events on The Irish Times live story here."", ""Catherine Martin sticks to her guns over collapse in trust of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh Appearing before  Oireachtas media committee, the Minister threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim the board’s role in an exit package had been communicated to department At the heart of Catherine Martin’s Tuesday night appearance at the Oireachtas media committee was the total collapse of her relationship with, and trust in, the former chairwoman of RTÉ last week. Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department.

"Statutory inquiry into sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools agreed at Cabinet Work on preparations for the inquiry by officials, including legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas, will begin shortly  The Government has formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools. Work on preparations for the inquiry by officials, including legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas, will begin shortly and there is also expected to be extensive consultations with survivors of abuse. The proposals were brought to the Government on Tuesday morning by Minister for Education Norma Foley following agreement among the three Coalition party leaders on Monday night. It is understood that the Government intends to set up a Commission of Investigation, in line with the report’s recommendations. Discussions on the terms of reference will take place over the coming weeks, it is expected, but the recommendation from the scoping report is that all types of school should be included, rather than just those run by religious orders. A scoping report into the allegations of abuse at schools run by religious orders – prompted by accounts of abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin, which in turn prompted an outpouring of similar stories – is expected to be published by the Government, perhaps as early as this evening. Ms Foley and her officials have been considering the 700-page report, commissioned last year from senior counsel Mary O’Toole following allegations of historic abuse at Blackrock College. The scoping inquiry conducted by Ms O’Toole included religious-run boarding and day schools, and it is understood that the report features schools run by many different religious orders. Sources say that there may be thousands of cases of sexual abuse in the schools. Officials are continuing to work on proposals for a redress scheme for victims of past abuse with at least part of the costs being met by the religious orders. Ms Foley and her officials have been drawing up plans which are expected to be heavily influenced by the wishes of survivors. The terms of reference for the scoping exercise specifically required that Ms O’Toole, when making recommendations to the Government, should have regard to “alignment with outcomes sought by survivors of historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders”. It says this should be “informed by the survivor engagement process” which has been part of the scoping inquiry’s work. An advocacy group for victims of sexual abuse in Spiritan schools said the establishment of a redress scheme only after the conclusion of any inquiry would result in “further delays to urgently needed justice”. A statement released by the Restore Together group said any statutory inquiry “must be structured to reflect the urgency of the situation” and by “putting the best interests of victims/survivors first”. The group said this could be done by “the concurrent operation of parallel strands of any inquiry aimed at providing healing, redress and justice”. Survivors received communication from the Government’s Survivor Engagement Lead Kieran McGrath on Tuesday morning informing them a copy of the report would be made available to them before it was published. “We recognise that receiving the Report is significant and that there is likely to be media coverage and discussion of the contents in the coming days. We understand that this may be difficult for you,” Mr McGrath said in an email on Tuesday. He also said that up to six sessions with a qualified counsellor would be made available to any survivor who requested it, with longer term support available from One in Four and other organisations.",2,2_abuse_schools_religious_orders,"['abuse', 'schools', 'religious', 'orders', 'inquiry', 'report', 'survivors', 'scoping', 'sexual', 'redress']","['Labour calls for acceleration of divestment of schools from religious orders after abuse inquiry Ivana Bacik emphasises need for timely redress scheme and says her party willing to work with Government to make this happen The State should urgently reboot the process to divest schools from religious patronage, Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik has said. She said the process had been started by her party colleague Ruairí Quinn when Minister for Education in 2011 but had effectively stalled since he stood down as minister. The Labour leader made the call when responding to the publication of a scoping report which disclosed widespread sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders throughout the State. Speaking before the start of a special parliamentary meeting of her party at the Grand Hotel in Malahide, Ms Bacik also said it was vital that a Redress Scheme be run in parallel with the Commission of Investigation so that survivors are not waiting any longer for justice to be done for them. She also welcomed that the Garda had begun criminal investigations into some of the over 800 alleged abusers identified by victims in 308 schools. “We [need] to look at the divestment of schools from religious orders. For far too long, our school system in Ireland, uniquely in Europe, has been dominated by religious [orders].” She said that over 90 per cent of our primary schools still had religious patronage. “We need to ensure there’s divestment, that we see that the process initiated by Ruairí Quinn is now speeded up and continued, so that religious orders, complicit in such awful horrors in the past, no longer have authority over our schoolchildren in our education system.” She said a core “mission” of the Labour Party was to afford children the right to have an equal future and an equal start. She said in the last redress scheme – in relation to abuse which occurred in religious-run residential settings for children, the orders had not paid their fair share. “Far too many hid behind what we might describe as the developer’s wife system, where their assets were transferred to a trust. What we want to see with this new set of revelations is that the religious orders made to pay their share.” Ms Bacik told reporters it was her view that the Commission should begin its work by looking at the 308 schools included in the scoping inquiry and then extending to look at other schools. She again emphasised the need for a timely redress scheme and said her party was willing to work with the Government to make this happen. She said Minister for Education Norma Foley had worked very closely with other parties during the scoping inquiry and was very respectful of the wishes of survivors throughout the process. Asked if there was a means of ensuring that religious orders paid their share, Ms Bacik said there was nothing illegal about the trust system but there were “serious ethical questions” that had to be asked about why the orders had done so. Asked about the responsibility of the State, she said nobody was suggesting the religious orders should bear 100 per cent responsibility. “Clearly, the State was deeply at fault for failure to regulate, failure to ensure proper governance in schools, for really abdicating responsibility for running and governance of schools and management of schools to religious orders,” she said. Speaking about her party’s preparation for the general election, she said that it had already selected 16 candidates and was buoyed by strong results in the local and European elections. However, she would not put a figure on how many seats the party expected to win, other than to say she wanted to return with more seats than its present six. Ms Bacik said the party would not be involved in a vote transfer agreement with any other party before the general election. “After the election, certainly, we will look to sit down with those parties and representatives who share our vision, our centre left and social democratic values. “We will be looking to form a bloc for negotiations on any programme for Government to make sure that our Labour vision and values form the heart of the next Government.”', 'Major inquiry into sexual abuse in schools to be recommended by scoping report The scoping inquiry was commissioned last year after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by past pupils A scoping report on historical abuse at boarding and day schools run by religious orders is understood to recommend a statutory inquiry be set up to examine the sexual abuse of potentially thousands of children. The leaders of the Government parties discussed the issue on Tuesday night with the Minister for Education Norma Foley, whose department commissioned the scoping report by senior counsel Mary O’Toole last year. The report, which runs to more than 700 pages, was expected to be discussed by the Cabinet on Wednesday but that was postponed, three people familiar with the issue said. It is expected that officials will continue to work on a plan for publication of the report, and to work with survivors of abuse. It is likely to be approved by the Cabinet and published in September, after which a statutory inquiry is expected to be established. Once an inquiry has been concluded, it is likely that a redress scheme, to be funded at least in part by contributions from the religious order, will be established. The scoping inquiry was instituted last year by Ms Foley after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by a number of past pupils. The allegations first emerged when two brothers, David and Mark Ryan, spoke publicly of being sexually abused by priests at Blackrock College and its affiliate junior school, Willow Park. Both schools were run by the Spiritan congregation, formerly the Holy Ghost Fathers. The brothers first spoke about being sexually abused as boys in the south Dublin secondary school in an RTÉ radio documentary, Blackrock Boys, in 2022. They discovered each other’s abuse only in 2002, many years after it took place. Mark Ryan died last year in London after suffering a suspected heart attack. The documentary led to a wave of revelations and hundreds of survivors reporting they were also abused as boys in schools run by the Spiritans, as well as other congregations who ran day and boarding schools in the past. It later emerged that more than 140 people reported incidences of child sexual abuse involving 18 abusers to gardaí investigating such allegations at the schools in south Dublin. The scoping inquiry was set up by the Department of Education to advise the Government on the nature of the issue and the possible next steps. It was broadened to include allegations of abuse in religious-run boarding and day schools, and received more than 200 submissions. It is understood the report features schools runs by many different religious orders. The report was delivered to Ms Foley in early June. It is understood it has estimated that there may be thousands of cases of sexual abuse in the schools.

She said Minister for Education Norma Foley had worked very closely with other parties during the scoping inquiry and was very respectful of the wishes of survivors throughout the process.

The leaders of the Government parties discussed the issue on Tuesday night with the Minister for Education Norma Foley, whose department commissioned the scoping report by senior counsel Mary O’Toole last year. The report, which runs to more than 700 pages, was expected to be discussed by the Cabinet on Wednesday but that was postponed, three people familiar with the issue said. It is expected that officials will continue to work on a plan for publication of the report, and to work with survivors of abuse. It is likely to be approved by the Cabinet and published in September, after which a statutory inquiry is expected to be established. Once an inquiry has been concluded, it is likely that a redress scheme, to be funded at least in part by contributions from the religious order, will be established. The scoping inquiry was instituted last year by Ms Foley after allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin were made by a number of past pupils. The allegations first emerged when two brothers, David and Mark Ryan, spoke publicly of being sexually abused by priests at Blackrock College and its affiliate junior school, Willow Park. Both schools were run by the Spiritan congregation, formerly the Holy Ghost Fathers. The brothers first spoke about being sexually abused as boys in the south Dublin secondary school in an RTÉ radio documentary, Blackrock Boys, in 2022. They discovered each other’s abuse only in 2002, many years after it took place. Mark Ryan died last year in London after suffering a suspected heart attack. The documentary led to a wave of revelations and hundreds of survivors reporting they were also abused as boys in schools run by the Spiritans, as well as other congregations who ran day and boarding schools in the past. It later emerged that more than 140 people reported incidences of child sexual abuse involving 18 abusers to gardaí investigating such allegations at the schools in south Dublin. The scoping inquiry was set up by the Department of Education to advise the Government on the nature of the issue and the possible next steps. It was broadened to include allegations of abuse in religious-run boarding and day schools, and received more than 200 submissions. It is understood the report features schools runs by many different religious orders. The report was delivered to Ms Foley in early June. It is understood it has estimated that there may be thousands of cases of sexual abuse in the schools. Ms Foley and her officials have been working on proposals which will be heavily influenced by the wishes of survivors of abuse in the schools. The terms of reference for the scoping exercise specifically required that Ms O’Toole, in making recommendations to the Government, should have regard to “alignment with outcomes sought by survivors of historical sexual abuse in schools run by religious orders”. It says this should be “informed by the survivor engagement process” which has been part of the scoping inquiry’s work.', 'Statutory inquiry into sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools agreed at Cabinet Work on preparations for the inquiry by officials, including legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas, will begin shortly  The Government has formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools. Work on preparations for the inquiry by officials, including legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas, will begin shortly and there is also expected to be extensive consultations with survivors of abuse. The proposals were brought to the Government on Tuesday morning by Minister for Education Norma Foley following agreement among the three Coalition party leaders on Monday night. It is understood that the Government intends to set up a Commission of Investigation, in line with the report’s recommendations. Discussions on the terms of reference will take place over the coming weeks, it is expected, but the recommendation from the scoping report is that all types of school should be included, rather than just those run by religious orders. A scoping report into the allegations of abuse at schools run by religious orders – prompted by accounts of abuse at Blackrock College in Dublin, which in turn prompted an outpouring of similar stories – is expected to be published by the Government, perhaps as early as this evening. Ms Foley and her officials have been considering the 700-page report, commissioned last year from senior counsel Mary O’Toole following allegations of historic abuse at Blackrock College. The scoping inquiry conducted by Ms O’Toole included religious-run boarding and day schools, and it is understood that the report features schools run by many different religious orders. Sources say that there may be thousands of cases of sexual abuse in the schools.

An advocacy group for victims of sexual abuse in Spiritan schools said the establishment of a redress scheme only after the conclusion of any inquiry would result in “further delays to urgently needed justice”. A statement released by the Restore Together group said any statutory inquiry “must be structured to reflect the urgency of the situation” and by “putting the best interests of victims/survivors first”. The group said this could be done by “the concurrent operation of parallel strands of any inquiry aimed at providing healing, redress and justice”. Survivors received communication from the Government’s Survivor Engagement Lead Kieran McGrath on Tuesday morning informing them a copy of the report would be made available to them before it was published. “We recognise that receiving the Report is significant and that there is likely to be media coverage and discussion of the contents in the coming days.

"Norma Foley vows school sexual abuse commission will be set up ‘as quickly as possible’ Minister for Education says she has convened a high-level group ‘which will progress the work that is needed to establish’ a commission Survivors of sexual abuse in schools have been promised by Minister for Education Norma Foley that a commission of investigation will be set up “as quickly as possible” and that a group of senior officials would soon consider issues such as redress and commemoration. The pledge came despite uncertainty at the highest levels of Government as to what steps should follow the publication this week of senior counsel Mary O’Toole’s report on child abuse in the education system, which detailed some 2,400 allegation of abuse across more than 300 schools. “We can’t just jump straight into redress,” one senior figure told The Irish Times. Following the report’s publication, Ms Foley has moved to reassure survivors that their concerns will remain “central” to the next stages of the process. The Government has decided to set up a commission of investigation, and while no decision on a redress scheme for survivors has been made, there is a general acceptance in the Coalition that one will follow. In a letter sent to survivors yesterday, the Minister said she has “convened a high-level group which will progress the work that is needed to establish” the commission. She also promised to move ahead quickly with the next steps. “I am conscious that time is of the essence, and I am determined that this commission will be in place as quickly as possible,” she wrote. “There is some complexity in establishing a process such as this to ensure that it is robust, but I assure you, that process will be dealt with expeditiously. This group will also consider the other important recommendations in the report, including those relating to redress, memorialisation, and of course, child protection.” A spokesman for the Department of Education said the group was “comprised of senior officials from relevant departments with support from the Office of the Attorney General and chaired at secretary general level”. He said the group’s membership had not been finalised, but the department was “committed to moving quickly into the next phase with a meeting to be held in the next fortnight”. It is understood that one of the issues to be considered by the group will be the cost of the inquiry, with sources saying the Government had on Tuesday mandated the group to provide an estimate. Former rapporteur on child protection Prof Conor O’Mahony said the Government should consider changing the law to allow survivors of abuse in schools to sue religious orders as part of a strategy to encourage contributions from church bodies to redress schemes. A senior Government source also privately raised this possibility. Prof O’Mahony, of the University College Cork School of Law, told The Irish Times it could be effective to temporarily adjust the statute of limitations to allow survivors – many of whom are barred from taking a case, as too long has elapsed since the alleged abuse  – to pursue a case through the courts. He said the costs of defending and settling potentially hundreds of civil actions could eclipse the cost of paying into a redress scheme, and this could “focus minds” among the religious orders. “If the Government wanted to make the orders feel a bit uncomfortable, that would be a very interesting way to do it – [by] carving out some exemption to it which would allow people to pursue them in court if they were so minded.”",2,2_abuse_schools_religious_orders,"['abuse', 'schools', 'religious', 'orders', 'inquiry', 'report', 'survivors', 'scoping', 'sexual', 'redress']","['Labour calls for acceleration of divestment of schools from religious orders after abuse inquiry Ivana Bacik emphasises need for timely redress scheme and says her party willing to work with Government to make this happen The State should urgently reboot the process to divest schools from religious patronage, Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik has said.

"Dublin gets new councillors just three months after elections Independent and former MMA fighter Paddy Holohan to co-opt a martial arts coach who works in his gym after winning two seats on South Dublin County Council New councillors will be appointed to fill empty seats on two Dublin local authorities on Monday, just three months after the local elections were held. Vacancies have arisen on South Dublin County Council and on Fingal County Council, both of which should have 40 elected representatives, with the 39 councillors in each area expected to agree to the co-option of a new member at their meetings on Monday. In the South Dublin local authority area a seat has been vacant since the elections on June 7th due to former mixed martial arts fighter Paddy Holohan running and winning seats in two electoral areas. Mr Holohan topped the poll in Tallaght South and was also elected in Tallaght Central. He chose to take up the Tallaght South seat, and has the right to nominate a new member for the Tallaght Central seat. Mr Holohan was first elected in 2019 as a Sinn Féin representative, but resigned from the party in March 2021 and ran in the most recent elections as an Independent. His resignation from Sinn Féin came after the party twice took disciplinary proceedings against the councillor. It emerged in January 2020 that during his “No Shame” podcast Mr Holohan had said he had heard “loads of” underage girls were having sex with men in order to blackmail them. There were, he said “some f**king scum women out there”. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald subsequently described his comments as “beyond offensive” and “vile” and he was suspended for a number of months. Following the lifting of this suspension local Sinn Féin councillors in June 2020 nominated Mr Holohan for the post of county mayor, but he was not elected by the other South Dublin councillors to the position. The following March the party again said it was taking disciplinary action against Mr Holohan after he refused a request to take down a social media post supporting a salon owner who reopened in breach of Covid-19 restrictions. This time Mr Holohan said he was leaving Sinn Féin, citing “highly unfair” treatment by the party the previous year when he said he had been placed under investigation but the findings of the investigation had not been released “to the public, to the media and or to the members of Sinn Féin themselves”. He saw out the remainder of the council term as an Independent. People Before Profit (PBP) councillors had urged Mr Holohan to co-opt their nominee for the local elections, Kieran Mahon, who came seventh in the six-seat constituency of Tallaght Central. However, Mr Holohan said he was “not swayed at all” by their request and was instead nominating Dean Donnelly, a martial arts coach who works in Mr Holohan’s gym. “PBP co-opted a councillor last term, and all councillors supported that with no issue. There was no issue expressed with me running in this area until I got elected there,” Mr Holohan told The Irish Times. He said he would continue to work for the people of Tallaght Central. “I was elected in that area, I reached the quota, regardless of the outcome I will continue to do the work I do and be a voice in that area.” In Fingal, Sinn Féin has nominated Ann Graves to fill the seat vacated by its councillor Marian Buckley, who resigned a month after the local elections. Ms Buckley in July announced she was stepping down due to medical advice. Ms Graves had been a sitting councillor heading into the elections, but lost her seat by two votes to Ms Buckley. Ms Graves will also be a Sinn Féin candidate for the next general election.",0,0_minister_rté_committee_martin,"['minister', 'rté', 'committee', 'martin', 'mcdonald', 'time', 'ní', 'people', 'told', 'raghallaigh']","[""Dáil committee calls for Comptroller & Auditor General to oversee RTÉ Controversy over large exit payments for departing executives to take the political centre stage again this week as Minister to appear before committee and Dáil RTÉ should in future be subjected to new financial controls as well as greater oversight around contracts and big exit packages, a new report from the Dáil’s most powerful committee is set to recommend. Members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) are due to meet on Tuesday to finalise a 70-page report into recent revelations around events in RTÉ, with the report set to call for the State broadcaster to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). Three sources familiar with the contents of the document said it will recommend tighter financial controls within the station, greater transparency around exit packages, and fresh oversight of contracts. The committee is set to recommend that the broadcaster should: implement a new written policy on negotiations with agents with all discussions minuted and documented; provide an annual statement about activity in the barter account; and reveal the exact amounts paid out in exit payments every year. New financial controls should also be put in place for big projects. The report is being closely guarded and has yet to be circulated, with PAC members invited to view only the draft recommendations in person last week. Any move to bring RTÉ under the remit of the C&AG would mean RTÉ's accounts would be inspected and audited every year, and that any issues would be flagged with the PAC and wider political system. Such a move is now being seriously considered within the Government, a senior source said, adding that fresh legislation would likely be needed. It comes as the controversy over large exit payments for departing executives looks set to take the political centre stage again this week. Minister for Media Catherine Martin is due to appear before the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday to answer questions on what is being viewed politically as the forced resignation of RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh. Ms Martin last week accused Ms Ní Raghallaigh of providing misleading information about a confidential severance payment to former chief financial officer Richard Collins. Ms Martin said that on two occasions last week she had received assurances that the board had had no role in the approval of the exit package. Despite the assurances, the Minister said it had emerged that the remuneration committee of the board, which was chaired by Ms Ní Raghallaigh, had approved the package. In an interview on RTÉ's Prime Time programme, Ms Martin twice refused to offer confidence in the chair, precipitating her resignation later that night. A key consideration this week will be a claim made by Ms Ní Raghallaigh upon her departure that on October 10th last year she rang the former secretary general of the Department of Media Katherine Licken and told her the remuneration committee had approved an agreement with Mr Collins. Ms Licken is understood to be “emphatic”, sources say, that she was not told about the board approving the package. The Minister has been told by the Oireachtas Committee on Media that Ms Licken may attend Tuesday’s meeting if she so wishes, with committee members keen to hear from her in person. Sinn Féin has also called for Ms Martin to answer questions on the controversy in the Dáil this week. While the Minister has so far committed only to making statements in the Dáil, increasing pressure – including the looming threat of a possible no-confidence motion from the Labour Party – may change this. Members of the Oireachtas media committee also confirmed on Sunday that they may now also seek to reinvite Ms Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst before the committee to answer detailed questions about all exit or severance packages that have been approved in recent years. Such a meeting could happen in March, drawing the controversy out into the spring. The Minister’s spokesman sought on Sunday to downplay a report in the Business Post that officials from the Department of Media were told last October that the remuneration committee was approving exit payments. At a sitting of the PAC in October, an RTÉ executive said the remuneration committee was now covering exit packages. A spokesman said it was a “passing reference” which would not have made it obvious that the remuneration committee had new powers. The spokesman said that, on the contrary, the former chair told the Minister that this new responsibility would come into effect in the future."", ""RTÉ’s latest crisis: What further questions need to be asked? Catherine Martin, Kevin Bakhurst and the Department of Media are among those with more explaining to do   One of the hallmarks of the RTÉ crisis has been its capacity to rapidly shift in different directions, drawing in new controversies as it continues to unspool across the political system. After a dramatic Prime Time appearance  led to the overnight resignation of the RTÉ chair, the events of the last 12 hours have brought the crisis to the door of Minister for Arts and Media Catherine Martin. As of this morning, she is facing calls from the Labour Party to resign on grounds that she has “failed to ask the most basic questions” and “presided over a most damaging period for the State broadcaster where public trust has been totally demolished”. Quite the charge sheet – and surely others will follow as the crisis gathers pace. How did we get here, and what questions need to be asked? Ms Martin went on RTÉ's Prime Time programme to discuss the latest chapter in the continuing controversy at the broadcaster – exit packages for executives who left in the wake of the crisis over undisclosed payments to Ryan Tubridy that emerged last summer. The political system has, for the guts of a week, been agitating for more information on what was paid to Rory Coveney, formerly RTÉ's director of strategy, and its former chief financial officer Richard Collins. These deals took place as current director general Kevin Bakhurst sought to clear the house and put his stamp on the station, and therefore soured relations between him and the Government as well. But truth be told, it was a chapter of middling intensity in the wider saga, with nobody happy, relations damaged and no easy way out – but equally, no expectation that heads would have to roll to bring it to a close. And then, Martin went on Prime Time and told the nation that she had twice sought confirmation from RTÉ chair Siún Ní Raghallaigh that the board had not approved the exit packages this week, and had twice been told it had not. However, on Thursday, Ms Ní Raghallaigh had contacted the Department of Media and told them that the remuneration committee of the board had approved Mr Collins’s exit deal. Ms Martin said she was deeply disappointed, had written to the RTÉ chair and would meet her on Friday morning, and the Minister failed to express confidence in her. On the face of it, this is a most grave matter: Ministers must be able to trust the information being given to them by chairs in the teeth of a crisis. The assessment across Government was swift, shocked, angry and nearly unanimous. “Hard to see her staying on,” texted one senior source. “The whole debacle is getting more dysfunctional by the minute,” said a Minister. A second Minister texted: “When you couldn’t think things could get any worse ... the whole saga is a shambles.” A third: “It’s hard to see any scenario or explanation here that is good and this is a deeply concerning development”. The writing was on the wall – in the early hours of Friday morning, Ms Ní Raghallaigh resigned – but her statement has upped the political pressure. The timelines are important: a classic game of political “who knew what and when” is now under way. On October 9th, according to Ms Ní Raghaillagh’s statement, the exit package for Mr Collins was brought to and approved by the remuneration committee. The following day, she says she informed the department “about the process which led to Richard’s departure from RTÉ”. This is key as it suggests there was knowledge within the department for some months about the very matter that has precipitated the chair’s resignation. Ms Ní Raghaillaigh may have failed to recollect this detail when asked about it this week – that is a serious issue, as a chair must keep a minister abreast of correct information at all times. But if the information was known by the department, why was it not known by the Minister? Who in the department was told? What did they do with the information? Are there records of the meetings of October 9th and the disclosures of October 10th, and will they now be released? If the RTÉ chair failed to remember a key detail, it is bad for her. But if she had previously told the department that detail, and it failed to percolate up to the Minister, that is another thing entirely. There are many issues now for Ms Martin. It is worth remembering that she has faced significant criticism since last summer for failing to grab the crisis by the scruff of the neck, put a political stamp on it and assert her authority – for being passive, in effect, and for being behind the curve. As with all accusations within the Leinster House bubble, there is politics underlying those charges – and yet, that is the context in which she now faces key questions. Why, for example, did she not seek in October (or indeed in July, when Rory Coveney left) confirmation that the board had, or hadn’t, approved packages? She indicated last night that she had an awareness of some sort of package or legal issue – why did she not seek to equip herself with more information about what the board did or didn’t know? She was in the middle of a crisis that to no small degree focused on the board’s ignorance of key details around the Tubridy deal – did she not want to know more about what the board’s involvement was regarding executive exits? What she knew, what she did (or didn’t do), and when, are now key matters. She will also face questions over her decision-making in the last 12 hours: why did she bring matters to a head by going on Prime Time? Cancelling the interview would have sparked suspicions, but if she wanted to create a space for her and Ní Raghaillagh to have a dialogue on Friday morning, any chance of that was gone the moment she started speaking on air. It is clear the current chapter has taken some sheen off Mr Bakhurst as well, and he will face demands for more explanations. He was in the meeting this week with Ms Martin and Ms Ní Raghaillagh when the Minister was seemingly assured there was no board sign-off for either deal. Did he know that the remuneration committee had approved it? And if so, why didn’t he say as much in meetings with the Minister this week? Like all proper crises, this is sucking in not just Ministers, but their officials. It now must be asked what the department did with the information it received on October 10th – if it wasn’t passed to the Minister, why not? And what exactly was it told? And if officials knew there had been board approval for Mr Collins’s deal, why didn’t they speak up between now and then? Vitally, why didn’t they speak up this week if they were present when the Minister was seeking assurances? Ms Ní Raghaillaigh’s statement on Friday  pointedly said that she did “remind [officials] that I had previously appraised them of the matter in October”. The Department has some explaining to do. Another day of hectic developments beckons.

Time and again, Martin emphasised that her faith in Siún Ní Raghallaigh’s capacity to provide her with accurate information had been totally depleted – first by events that took place months ago, when she apologised for not passing on that former Director General Dee Forbes had been asked to resign. And then, in the course of the last week when Ní Raghallaigh again had to apologise for not passing on that former director of strategy Rory Coveney had been given an exit package (“I should have told you, and I’m sorry,” Martin recounted the RTÉ chair as saying), after which she provided inaccurate information over whether the board had signed off on an exit for former chief financial officer Richard Collins. This culminated in an extraordinary exchange last Thursday, laid out by Martin at the committee. After she expressed her shock and disappointment, through officials, the message came back to the minister that the RTÉ chair felt there was no need for a meeting to discuss the matter, that she did not want to receive a letter about it, and indeed, in effect threatened to resign if such a letter materialised. It amounts to an extraordinary exchange. “Astounding,” in Martin’s words. It was followed with a Prime Time interview that triggered the resignation. Martin came under sustained pressure from her fellow politicians on the committee over exactly what happened. As she arrived in RTÉ, she said media queries made clear that it was about to break that she had been given incorrect information by the chair. Her advisers flagged the issue to Prime Time, whose presenter Miriam O’Callaghan predictably probed it on air. Martin, it seems, was not expecting to be asked whether she lost confidence – and in her own telling to the committee, was trying to figure out ways to avoid saying she had lost confidence. But the political reality is that once you don’t express full confidence, the horse has bolted. That a Cabinet minister would be unaware of this appeared to stretch the credulity of the committee members. By the time she sat down in front of the Oireachtas media committee on Tuesday evening, the Minister for Media had been in the spotlight for four full days. Beforehand, the hope was that the under-siege minister could shift the spotlight off her, her actions and her department – and back to RTÉ, emphasising her own plan of action and in so doing laying down a gauntlet to Montrose. Martin was composed and stuck to her plan – an hour in, there was little in the way of commentary on what exactly the department knew about Collins’s exit package, one of the key points of vulnerability for the minister going in, who had faced accusations that she had in effect engineered the departure of the chair based on withholding of information which already resided in the department. Indeed, Martin threw further doubt on Ní Raghallaigh and RTÉ's claim that the board’s role had been communicated to the department, saying the former chair told officials last week she “imagined” she would have mentioned it. It is worth noting that two Senators directly targeted Kevin Bakhurst, the current Director General – the political consensus underpinning his stewardship of the broadcaster is now beginning to show cracks. Martin’s strategy – of putting such focus on Ní Raghallaigh and giving such a detailed account of the breakdown last week – is not without risk. Questions will remain over her decision-making on Thursday, and perhaps most importantly, Ní Raghallaigh will seemingly get her chance to put her version on the record with the committee after it agreed to invite her and Katherine Licken, the former secretary general in Martin’s department. If that happens, for the umpteenth time, all eyes will be on the committee rooms.""]",minister - rté - committee - martin - mcdonald - time - ní - people - told - raghallaigh,0.2710424731457148,False
