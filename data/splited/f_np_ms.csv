Stating that the impacts of climate change are increasing in Nepal, lawmaker Sonam Gelzen Sherpa emphasized that the government should address this issue seriously on the international stage and seek compensation. Due to the impact of climate change, the melting and outburst of glaciers in the Himalayas, landslides and droughts in the hilly regions, and floods in the Terai-Madhesh are becoming increasingly evident, he said. MP Sherpa further stated, ""The effects of climate change are becoming more evident in Nepal. I would like to draw the government's attention to how we should present this issue on the international stage."" He also urged the government to move forward on the issue of climate change in international forums. Sherpa demanded that the budget be allocated to work in the field of climate change and research to mitigate its effects. Another lawmaker, Jayanti Devi Rai, suggested that the residents of Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality-5, Thame of Solukhumbu, who were affected by the floods, should be relocated to a safer place. Stating that significant damage was caused by recent floods in Thame, Solukhumbu, MP Krishna Bahadur Rokaya emphasized the need to investigate the cause of the glacier outburst in the upper part of Thame. It is said that there are 21 glaciers in Nepal at risk of outbursts. Similarly, lawmaker Rukmini Koirala demanded that the government collect accurate details of the flood damage in Thame and compensate the affected victims. She also called for the government to study and provide information on whether the flood destruction in Thame is attributable to climate change. Lawmaker Gopi Bahadur Sarki Achami suggested that the government study the glaciers at risk and take preventive measures. He said, ""It is said that other glaciers are also at risk of bursting. However, whether the government is aware of this or not is unclear. The government should pay attention to the reconstruction of Thame and arrange for the rehabilitation of the victims.” Lawmakers argued that the damage caused by floods in Melamchi, Kagbeni, and Sudurpaschim was also attributable to climate change. Nepal's role in greenhouse gas emissions is negligible. However, Nepal is among the 19 countries in the world at high risk of the negative impacts of climate change. The United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP) is held every year to find ways to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change. The COP-28, held last November in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, made historic decisions, including the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era, the establishment of the Loss and Damage Fund, and various contributions to climate finance. Experts have argued that the Nepal government should inform the international community about the damage caused by the effects of climate change and lobby for compensation.",1,0
