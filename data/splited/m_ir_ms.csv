2024/1/1,"Leo Varadkar says he is not changing his life despite risks to politicians’ safety Garda protection was extended to Cabinet members after assessment found heightened risk to politicians Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he will not change the way he lives his life in response to risks to politicians’ safety that have arisen in recent years. There were serious disturbances outside Leinster House on September 20th, the first day back after the Dáil’s summer recess, as politicians from across the political spectrum were targeted by protesters. Last year saw a series of anti-immigration demonstrations, in part whipped up by far-right activists. Politicians, including Mr Varadkar, have seen protests at their own homes or offices in recent years. During an interview with political journalists, the Fine Gael leader was asked if he has changed how he lives or what he shares on social media as a result of the kinds of angry confrontations that have been happening involving politicians. “To be honest, I’ve kind of refused to change my life…” Mr Varadkar said. “I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that the threat is higher, and the risk to my personal safety is real and that is the case for other Ministers too.” Mr Varadkar said Garda Commissioner Drew Harris took the decision to extend Garda protection to all members of Cabinet, including the three “super-junior” Ministers, “based on security assessments that the risk to politicians... is heightened”. But, Mr Varadkar added: “I haven’t changed the way I live my life, nor will I. “First of all, I’m not going to give into it and, secondly… I see how other countries operate where politicians, ministers, prime ministers live in a security bubble and.... really forget what it’s like just to do normal things and live a normal life.” Mr Varadkar said he will keep going to cinemas, restaurants and bars as well as the gym. In a separate interview, Tánaiste Micheál Martin poured cold water on the prospect of Ireland following the UK in considering limits on children’s access to social media to protect them from online harm. There were reports last month that British prime minister Rishi Sunak was considering doing this, with a ban for under-16s believed to be one of the options being explored. Mr Martin said there is “merit” in restricting the use of mobile phones in schools and also in teaching children about the “challenges and opportunities” of social media. But, the Fianna Fáil leader said he does not see “any feasible solution” that would involve a ban “once you have the proper checks and balances and age status and so on”. Elsewhere, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan talked up his party’s election prospects in response to a suggestion from a reporter that small parties in coalitions suffer at election time. He said the Green Party has 106 candidates selected for June’s local elections, half of whom are women, and that “they’re really fired up, so we’ve never been in a better position to go into an election”.",0,1
2024/1/10,"Opposition to single men seeking asylum is increasingly a fact of political life in Ireland Far right actors may accelerate mistruths, but ascribing every protest to agitators is a fallacy There is, in the words of one person closely involved in sourcing accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers, “a major issue in relation to single men”. It is even more pronounced in the case of non-white single men, they say. This was captured in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo, on Monday when protests melted away after the Government committed to accommodating families in the former JJ Gannon guesthouse, rather than 50 single men. Those working on the ground say that many of those protesting are ordinary members of the community – that while far right actors may play a role, accelerating mistruths or propagating racist tropes online, ascribing every protest to agitators is a fallacy. TDs, who are closely attuned to what their constituents are thinking, say the same. Whatever factors are driving it, that is the blunt reality. Opposition to accommodation for single men seeking asylum is, increasingly, a fact of political life in Ireland. The chief criticism of the Government is that it is not communicating adequately. Eamon Ryan spoke on Tuesday about a campaign which will explain the “basic mechanics” of migration, and doubtlessly better communication is needed. But the evidence suggests that even if it was communicated weeks or months in advance that large groups of single men were being moved in somewhere, the outcome would not be any different: protests, maybe even blockades, perhaps even arson. The question for the Government, and those working to accommodate international protection (IP) applicants and those fleeing Ukraine, is what to do about it. And the answer may be that it is increasingly impossible to have a strategy which concentrates large groups of single men together in accommodation centres. This week in 2023, single men accounted for 47 per cent of arrivals seeking international protection. Arrivals declined during the following months, when accommodation could not be offered – before picking up again across the summer – in July, the figure was 55 per cent, in August 52 per cent, in September and October 50 per cent, and 43 per cent in November. In December that number dropped sharply – in the last week it was just 29 per cent. The verdict in Government is that this is down to word of mouth as news of the accommodation shortfall spread again. While the level of single men may ebb and flow, migration trends are such that one source involved in managing accommodation for the State predicts this will be an issue for at least a decade. Part of the answer, this source argues, is to allow for compromise with communities and to move away from centres that house only single men. This may involve toughening up with accommodation providers, demanding that they offer housing suitable for families, even if it is less profitable, in exchange for Government contracts. It will also involve planning more strategically, as opposed to fire fighting and taking every offer of accommodation that comes in. Sources say there are indications that this is beginning to happen, with a pipeline of larger scale centres in the medium term. Integration is difficult. At pace, it’s more difficult still. With migration politics forcing its way to the forefront in an election year, pulling up the handbrake in the face of opposition risks creating a blueprint that will be replicated elsewhere. Meanwhile, it seems that every opening of an asylum accommodation centre is now a flashpoint in waiting. The pressure is on the State to get better and be quicker in finding solutions that work.",0,1
2024/1/10,"Judgment of International Court of Justice against Israel will be ‘severe’ unless it immediately stops onslaught of Gaza, says Ryan   Minister for Climate Action says key sections of evidence being presented in case taken by South Africa against Israel are ‘irrefutable’  The judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Israeli over alleged genocide in Gaza will be “very severe” unless it immediately stops its onslaught on the Palestinian enclave, Minister for Climate Action and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said. He said key parts of the evidence being presented by South Africa, which is taking the case against Israel, were “irrefutable” and could not be defended. He said the evidence came from two highly respected United Nations agencies. He said the World Food Program (WFP) had found that the entire 2.2 million population of Gaza was under crisis and facing acute levels of food insecurity. He said the WFP had found that more than a quarter of the population had already exhausted their food supplies and had exhausted their coping capacities. “They face catastrophic hunger and starvation. That’s an immediate risk. That’s the World Food Program saying that’s the risk today.” Mr Ryan said the UN Commission on Human Rights had said on November 16th that the international community had an obligation to prevent atrocity crimes, including genocide. “It said we should immediately consider all diplomatic and political and economic measures to that end. That’s coming from UN organisations. That’s not something that you can put off. That’s not something you can be diplomatic and polite about. That’s an immediate urgent atrocity in the making unless they stop now.” Mr Ryan was speaking the opening day of the ICJ hearings in The Hague on a case being taken by South Africa alleging genocide by Israel. The Israeli government is defending its actions. Mr Ryan argued that Ireland as a country had consistently stood up for the rights of the Palestinian people going back decades. “But also in an immediate sense to stand (against) the actions the Israeli government and military are taking, which are putting Palestinian people in Gaza at risk of immediate starvation.” He said if the Israeli government did not change tack the rest of the world would deliver a “really harsh judgment” on what had been done to the Palestinian people. He said this did not undermine in any way the right of Israel to its safety. He also deplored the atrocity that occurred on October 7th.* “The scale of what Israel is doing, and the risk to the Palestinian people, absolutely has to stop, and if not the judgment in my mind against the Israeli government will be severe,” said Mr Ryan. *This article was edited on Friday, January 26th, 2024 to remove a clause that inaccurately summarised the events of October 7th.",0,1
2024/1/10,"Ombudsman for Children calls for reversal of recession-era downgrade of his role Office of watchdog for children’s interests was bumped down Civil Service salary scale from a maximum of €178,000 to up to €130,000 The Ombudsman for Children has written to the Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman asking for his “intervention” in reversing a post-recession cutback in his role from assistant secretary general level to principal officer higher. Dr Niall Muldoon wrote to Mr O’Gorman two months ago stating that he saw the reversal of the downgrade as being “in the best interest of children”. In the letter dated November 14th, Dr Muldoon said the role of Ombudsman for Children was downgraded from assistant secretary general to principal officer level in 2015 as part of Fempi, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. “I am writing to you now to seek the reversal of that downgrade, in line with the reversal of all other Fempi cutbacks across the civil and public service,” Dr Muldoon said. “I see this as being in the best interest of children.” According to Fórsa’s Civil Service salary scale, an assistant secretary’s salary ranges from €156,472 to €178,995 while a higher principal officer’s salary is €106,187-€130,951. Dr Muldoon said in the letter, which was released to The Irish Times under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, that he had been engaged in long-term discussions with the Department of Children regarding the repositioning of the role of Ombudsman for Children. “I understood the measures taken during a time of economic crisis in 2015, via Fempi, were set out on a legal basis and were always intended to be temporary,” Dr Muldoon said. “Indeed, at this point, I believe that all of the Fempi cutbacks have now been reversed across the Civil Service. However, I have been seeking the reversal of the decision to downgrade this role since 2021 and it has still not happened.” Dr Muldoon also said he had engaged with two secretary generals in the department who had both been “extremely supportive” of the argument to return the post to the level of assistant secretary. However, he said the Department of Public Expenditure had advised that the Senior Posts Remuneration Committee would be established and direct on remuneration arrangements for senior posts in the public service and chief executives of commercial State bodies. Dr Muldoon said it was his contention that “this is not about the ‘remuneration of senior posts” but instead about the “closing off of a process set in motion through Fempi”. Dr Muldoon added that he was asking the Minister to “step in and make that case” to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. He said since 2015 the office of the Ombudsman for Children had increased its activity levels and work for children “enormously” and there had been a rise in “innovative and important investigations and reports” published. Concluding his correspondence, Dr Muldoon noted he was in his second and final term as Ombudsman for Children and was committed to “doing everything in my power to ensure that the office is in the strongest position possible to work for the rights of all the children in Ireland”. A spokeswoman for the Ombudsman for Children said Mr O’Gorman had responded and acknowledged that Fempi legislation was intended to be temporary. The Department for Children said Mr O’Gorman had written to the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe regarding the issue. It added that the Ombudsman for Children’s office was also in receipt of a director’s allowance.",0,1
2024/1/11,"Taoiseach hopes ICJ makes interim ceasefire order while deliberating on Israel genocide case Sinn Féin TD says Ireland should have made itself a party to South African proceedings over Gaza Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he hopes the International Court of Justice might make an interim order calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, while it deliberates over South Africa’s proceedings alleging genocide against Israel. The case filed last month by South Africa, which has opened in The Hague, alleges that “acts and omissions by Israel are genocidal in character” with the specific intention to “destroy Palestinians in Gaza as part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnic group”. Asked about the matter during a visit to Pristina, Kosovo, Mr Varadkar said the Government was “deeply concerned that Israel may have committed war crimes in its actions in Gaza and we have made that very clear”. “When it comes to the issue of genocide that is a very particular matter and the International Court of Justice will now have to rule on that and it may take many years before they rule on that,” he said. “The South African case might allow the International Court of Justice to make an order calling for the fighting to stop while the case is considered over the next number of years, and I think that’s where Ireland could play a role, if the ICJ issues such an order,” he said. Mr Varadkar added that the ICJ had issued a similar order following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had been ignored by Russia. “I would be afraid that Israel would do the same,” he said. “The Irish Government is calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, that’s the most important thing, that the violence should stop and we can move towards a political solution and that will be a two state solution.” Mr Varadkar was speaking after meeting 13 Defence Forces troops stationed with the Nato-led peacekeeping mission in the west Balkan country. Earlier, Sinn Féin TD Matt Carthy said the Government should have made itself party to the South African proceedings against Israel. The party’s foreign affairs spokesman said: “Over 10,000 children have now been killed as a result of the Israeli indiscriminate bombardment. This is an important time for international leadership. Unfortunately, that international leadership has been sorely lacking in many quarters.” Mr Carthy said the Government has been “one of the more progressive voices” on the bombardment of Gaza and Sinn Féin has “acknowledged that and we’ve welcomed that”. However, he said Ireland “must go beyond words” at this stage. “What the Palestinian people require, what international law requires, and what humanity requires is meaningful action. The South African government has taken a meaningful action by bringing this case to The Hague this morning. And it is imperative in our view that the Irish government join them in that endeavour. He noted the Government’s decision to support Russia being prosecuted by the same court over its invasion of Ukraine but not in this instance. “There has to be a question asked as to why there is a dichotomy of positions in respect of the Irish Government with regard to taking meaningful actions when it comes to Israel.” Mr Carthy said it would be “untenable” for the Government to support the reappointment of Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission in light of her ongoing support for Israel since its invasion of Gaza. While supporting the European Union, he said Sinn Féin was not afraid to say when it had taken the wrong course of action in terms of austerity policies or foreign affairs policy. In what amounted to a call to the Irish Government not to support a further term in office for Ms von der Leyen, Mr Carthy said: “In my view, it would be absolutely untenable for any government that values international law and human rights to approve the reappointment of Ursula von der Leyen as European Commission president,” he said. He agreed there was no EU unity on the case. “The European Union collectively has yet to come to a position where it can call for a ceasefire. Therefore, it is imperative that member states within the EU, including Ireland, join with others from across the world and actually make sure that our voices are heard,” he said. “The Irish people in my view, are absolutely horrified by what they have seen in Gaza and are equally horrified by the failure of the international community to act accordingly. Ireland has to show leadership just as South Africa has shown leadership.”",0,1
2024/1/11,"‘Real fear’ people could be killed in arson attacks on accommodation for asylum seekers, says Varadkar Taoiseach anticipates arrests over the coming weeks in Garda investigations of incidents of arson Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he has a “real fear” that people could be killed in future arson attacks targeting accommodation for asylum seekers or buildings earmarked to be used as accommodation. There have been several occasions in recent months where fires have broken out in buildings being refurbished to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers, or that were rumoured to be planned for use. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Varadkar said it was a “big worry” that someone would be killed in arson attacks targeting such properties. “I do have a real fear that somebody could be very severely injured, or somebody could lose their life because of somebody attacking either a proposed centre or an existing centre,” he said. Buildings earmarked for accommodating asylum seekers could still have someone inside the property, even if it appeared vacant, he said. “Nobody engaging in arson can know for sure that there isn’t someone in there, whether it is a night watchman, a security guard or perhaps somebody sleeping rough,” he said. “It is a big worry that I have and very much on my radar and a concern for the Minister for Justice and also the Garda,” he said. The Fine Gael leader said recent suspected arson attacks were under investigation by the Garda. “There have been searches – we anticipate there will be arrests in the coming weeks and the full force of the law will be felt by anyone who engages in arson or engages in violence,” he said. “Gardaí are very much aware of the risks that arise, not just when we seek to establish a new accommodation centre but when it comes to existing ones as well that sadly are potential targets,” he said. Mr Varadkar said mainstream politicians had previously “shied away” from talking about migration policy for fear of stoking concerns. “I think we’re way past that point now ... those of us in centre-ground politics need to be willing to engage in the debate on migration to explain to people what our migration policy is, how it works and that migration in the round has been a very good thing for Ireland,” he said. “It’s not a surprise that migration has become a hot topic in Irish politics – it is all over Europe, all over the world. It’s really important that those of us in the centre ground are not afraid to be involved in this debate,” he said. Mr Varadkar was speaking at a press conference in Pristina following a meeting with Kosovo prime minister Albin Kurti, during a two-day visit to the west Balkans. The future of Kosovo was “in the European Union”, Mr Varadkar said. “I am very keen to be an ally, a partner, supporter of Kosovo in your efforts to become a member of the Council of Europe this year and to begin the process of negotiations with the European Union around membership,” he said. Later on Thursday Mr Varadkar is to meet some of the 13 Defence Forces personnel posted to a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. The mission, known as KFOR, has remained in place since the end of the 1998-99 war, where a Nato air campaign caused Serbian forces to withdraw from Kosovo, its former province. Mr Varadkar is also due to travel to Montenegro and then North Macedonia to meet senior politicians in both countries.",0,1
2024/1/11,"Michael McGrath faces renewed demands to scrap pay cap at AIB The Government resumes efforts this week to sell down its remaining 40.8 per cent stake in the bank to private shareholders Minister for Finance Michael McGrath is facing renewed demands to scrap the €500,000 pay cap at Allied Irish Banks (AIB), after the lender said private investors find the measure “untenable”. As the Government resumes efforts this week to sell down its remaining 40.8 per cent stake in the bank to private shareholders, the Department of Finance released private files showing how AIB chairman Jim Pettigrew told the Minister the cap was “front of mind” in his meetings with investors. “We have now reached a pivotal point where the group is in majority private ownership and we continually receive strong feedback from investors that these restrictions are untenable,” Mr Pettigrew said in a letter to Mr McGrath. “We believe that without it being addressed, it will ultimately impact on the value of the State’s shareholding in the bank.” The bank, Ireland’s largest by market capitalisation, has long pressed for the removal of the cap because of concern that top executives may leave for better pay in lenders where such restrictions do not apply. Still, Mr Pettigrew’s intervention goes further than before to seek action directly from the Minister. The cap was imposed in 2009 as most of the banking system was nationalised after the financial crash, imposing huge costs on the State that led to an international bailout. The State’s controlling interest in AIB ended only last June when a share sale put private investors in a majority for the first time since its €20.8 billion taxpayer rescue. Mr Pettigrew, AIB chairman since 2021, was formerly chairman of UK lenders Virgin Money and Clydesdale Bank. When the Minister met him in November, Mr McGrath said the cap was under consideration and “will be reviewed at the appropriate time”. Although the Minister has not moved since then, Mr Pettigrew promised AIB “would operate in a responsible manner” while he was chairman if the cap was lifted. Both the AIB board and private investors see the cap as a “material talent retention risk” that puts that bank at a “significant disadvantage” to competitors, the chairman said in his September letter to the Minister. With elections this year, however, any move to ease bank pay restrictions could expose the Government to Opposition attack from parties who argue the cap should be retained because of the legacy of crisis. A department briefing note for the Minister’s meeting with Mr Pettigrew said “the eventual removal of the remuneration restriction does not mean a return to the past” because pay governance had been strengthened. There was no comment from AIB or the department on the files, released under the Freedom of Information Act after a request for correspondence with retail banks. The files show the Permanent TSB chairwoman, Julie O’Neill, also questioned the cap when she met the Minister in November. There were no records on Bank of Ireland, where a pay cap was scrapped in 2022 when it returned to full private ownership after part-nationalisation. Bank of Ireland chief executive Myles O’Grady is on a salary of €950,000. The salary of AIB chief executive Colin Hunt is €500,000. On Tuesday the department extended its AIB share trading plan until July, continuing the process of selling down the Government stake that stood at 71.12 per cent two years ago. Mr Pettigrew recognised AIB owed taxpayers “an immense debt of gratitude”, saying it was crucial to repay the taxpayer investment “in full” as soon as possible. AIB has to date returned €13.6 billion to the State, leaving a €7.2 billion deficit from bailout costs. The State’s stake is valued at €4.26 billion. The State retains 57.4 per cent of PTSB. In a briefing note for Mr McGrath before his meeting with Ms O’Neill, the department said she would raise PTSB board concerns in relation to pay caps. “She will highlight the uneven playing field that is in place for PTSB in terms of attracting and retaining senior executives, when compared with Bank of Ireland.” The meeting minutes said Mr McGrath and Ms O’Neill discussed “risks, including remuneration”. PTSB declined to comment.",0,1
2024/1/11,"Taoiseach begins two-day visit to west Balkans Varadkar to discuss recent flare-up in tensions between Kosovo and Serbia during visit  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has begun a two-day visit to the Balkans where he is set to meet senior politicians in Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia to discuss matters including their aspirations to become members of the European Union. Mr Varadkar is scheduled to meet Kosovo’s prime minister, Albin Kurti, on Thursday, as well as the president Vjosa Osmani-Sadriu. He is then due to visit Irish peacekeeping troops posted in Pristina, the country’s capital. Ireland has 13 Defence Forces personnel posted to a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. The mission, known as KFOR, has remained in place since the end of the 1998-99 war, where a Nato bombing campaign caused Serbian forces to withdraw from Kosovo, its former province. It is expected that Mr Varadkar and Mr Kurti will discuss the recent escalation of tensions between Kosovo and Serbia. Issues have arisen over the past year in northern Kosovo, where there is a large concentration of ethnic Serbs near the border with Serbia. A police officer and three gunmen were killed when fighting broke out between Kosovar police and an armed group of ethnic Serbs at a monastery last September. A number of peacekeeping troops were also injured last May during clashes between ethnic Serb protesters and Kosovar police. Ethnic Albanians make up a majority of Kosovo’s 1.8 million people. However, the 50,000 Serbs in the north remain largely aligned to Belgrade, despite Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence. Ahead of his meeting with Mr Kurti, Mr Varadkar said he intended to “particularly encourage” the Kosovar leader to focus on efforts to normalise relations with Serbia, which he said was “essential” to both having a “path to EU membership”. Mr Varadkar is to meet the president of Montenegro, Jakov Milatović, and prime minister Milojko Spajić later on Thursday. He is to travel to Skopje in North Macedonia on Friday to meet president Stevo Pendarovski and prime minister Dimitar Kovačevski. The Taoiseach said he believed the future of the countries “lies within the EU”. “I know that all three countries are committed to implementing the necessary reforms. I look forward to discussing how we in Ireland, and our partners across Europe, can help these three countries to achieve full EU membership,” he said in a statement.",0,1
2024/1/11,"People Before Profit calls for ‘total dismantlement’ of Israeli state Party rejects idea of ‘two-state solution’ in newly published pamphlet and call for new ‘secular, democratic Palestine’ in place of Israel People Before Profit has called for the “total dismantlement” of the state of Israel and its replacement with a “secular, democratic Palestine”. In a pamphlet published on Thursday, the group rejects the idea of a “two-state solution” and says: “The only way out now is a one-state solution, requiring the total dismantlement of the racist, Apartheid Israeli state and all of its repressive capacity, its military, its courts, police and prisons. Replacing it, a secular, democratic Palestine where equal rights are guaranteed to individuals regardless of their religious or ethnic identity.” The group has five TDs in the People Before Profit-Solidarity alliance, which include Richard Boyd-Barrett and Paul Murphy, and has been an outspoken critic of Israel in Dáil debates since the attacks on Israel by Hamas on October 7th and the huge military response by the Israeli Defence Forces in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. In the pamphlet, entitled From the River to the Sea: The Struggle for Palestinian Liberation, the group rejects “western mainstream media” portrayals of Hamas. “Israel is a settler colonial society and inevitably this leads to a violent response from its subjects. The people of Gaza have been locked in an open prison for 17 years and so it is hardly surprising that some will try to break out and inflict suffering on their oppressors,” it says. It goes on to say: “The brutal realities of Zionism in its late stage of expansion are the backdrop for the events of October 7th when Hamas launched a do-or-die operation to break the 17-year siege on Gaza and to disrupt the complete colonisation of Palestine.” It also predicts that the Israeli assault on Gaza will add to the support for Palestinian armed resistance. “The loathing of Israel and the US will continue to result in increased Palestinian resistance. No matter how many Hamas fighters Israel executes, a new generation of fighters will arise. These in turn will be emboldened by the new wave of support for Palestine in the region and around the world.” The document dismisses Israeli opponents of the prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu government, and says that “Israeli democracy” is “a contradiction in terms”. Of protests against proposed judicial reforms in Israel, it says that “When half the population in historic Palestine is disenfranchised, these protests cannot be said to be about democracy. Instead, this was a case of the two wings of Zionism going up against one another to fight over how best to administer the oppression and dispossession of the Palestinian people.” “From the River to the Sea” is regarded by many Israelis and Jews as an anti-Semitic slogan, as they say it calls for the destruction of the State of Israel and of Israelis. At the launch of the pamphlet, Mr Boyd-Barrett was critical of the “ethno-nationalist supremacist ideology” of the Israeli state, but he has always rejected charges of anti-Semitism.",0,1
2024/1/12,"Taoiseach cannot ‘envisage’ sending Ukrainians home before war ends Decision to extend future protection to Ukrainians needs to apply across EU, Taoiseach says Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the Government could not “envisage” sending Ukrainian refugees back to Ukraine until the war with Russia was over. Under a European Union-wide directive, Ukrainians fleeing the war have been entitled to emergency accommodation, access to the labour market, education and social welfare. While the directive has been extended until March 2025, Mr Varadkar said the EU would need to agree on a way to continue to provide protection after that point. “I can’t envisage sending anyone back to Ukraine until it’s safe and anyone can see it is not safe ... I can’t envisage us being in a position to do that until the war is over,” he said. More than 100,000 Ukrainians have come to the Republic since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, with experts projecting the conflict to potentially last for at least several more years. Mr Varadkar said it was not possible to consider letting the directive offering Ukrainians protection in EU countries expire. “I would be of the view for as long as this war is raging the European Union should continue to allow people from Ukraine to take refuge in our countries,” he said. “There are some parts of the country where the war is raging every day, there are other parts where they are subject to intermittent rocket attacks, but I don’t think it is true to say there is any part of Ukraine that is safe enough to go back to,” he said. “About 20,000 of the people who came to Ireland from Ukraine have now either gone back to Ukraine or gone elsewhere, but that’s a very different thing to sending somebody back to Ukraine,” he said. The Fine Gael leader said there needed to be a joint decision taken at EU level on the arrangements to continue to provide protection to Ukrainians. “A decision will have to be made on whether or not we extend the Temporary Protection Directive, I anticipate we will,” he said. “What we want to do is to continue to act as a European Union, as 27 [member states], because what wouldn’t really work for anyone is having different countries [having] different rules in relation to Ukraine,” he said. “We should try to stick together as 27, if different countries start doing different things that will create all sorts of problems that are hard to anticipate,” he said. Mr Varadkar was speaking to reporters in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, after meeting the group of 13 Defence Forces troops stationed with the Nato-led peacekeeping mission in the west Balkan country. Earlier on Thursday he held separate meetings with Kosovo prime minister Albin Kurti and president Vjosa Osmani-Sadriu. Later that evening he travelled to Montenegro to meet prime minister Milojko Spajić, before a meeting the country’s president Jakov Milatović on Friday morning.

2024/1/12,"‘Complex’ genocide case against Israel ‘far from clear cut’, says Varadkar Taoiseach expresses concern attacks on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen could escalate into ‘severe regional conflict’ The International Court of Justice (ICJ) case accusing Israel of genocide in its war in Gaza was “far from clear cut”, despite some portraying the matter as such, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. On Friday Israel rejected the accusations in the case brought forward by South Africa to the United Nations’ court as “grossly distorted”. Israel said it has a right to defend itself following the October 7th attacks by Hamas militants, in response to allegations its subsequent bombing and ground offensive was aimed at bringing about “the destruction of the population” of Gaza. Mr Varadkar said some people were suggesting the case against Israel was clear cut. “I think this is actually quite a complex case and there are some people making it out to be much more simple than it actually is,” he said. “I do genuinely think we need to be careful about the use of the term genocide and accusations of genocide,” he said. “We should not forget that there are two or more parties in this conflict and I think sometimes people have a tendency to forget that,” he said. Earlier this week, Mr Varadkar said the Government was “deeply concerned” Israel may had committed war crimes in Gaza. Speaking on Friday, he said that the Government did not believe Israel’s response to the initial attacks by Hamas in southern Israel had been proportionate. “It is possible that the International Court of Justice may make some orders against Israel, calling for it to desist in certain activities that might lead to genocide,” he said. “There is no mechanism by which ICJ rulings can be enforced but I think it would strengthen the case for the UN and others to take a stronger position on this,” he said. “We’ll see how the court decides in the next couple of weeks in terms of any preliminary orders and then we’ll act at that point. We are already beginning conversations with like minded countries in the European Union about how we may act together,” he said. Mr Varadkar said he was worried about further escalation in the conflict, following US and British air strikes on Iran-backed Houthi forces in Yemen, in response to their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. “It is one of our greatest concerns that this could escalate into a much more severe regional conflict involving players like Iran and others,” he said. “We are seeing terrible violence against Palestinian people being perpetrated by extremist violent settlers in the West Bank. We are seeing clashes between Israel and Hizbullah over the Lebanese border and we’re now seeing these actions taking place in the Red Sea,” he said. Mr Varadkar was speaking in Skopje, North Macedonia, after a meeting with the country’s prime minister Dimitar Kovačevski, as part of a two-day visit to the western Balkans. The Taoiseach said he would like to see North Macedonia and a number of other small states be accepted into the European Union within the next five years and “certainly” within the decade. European institutions needed to do more for countries undertaking reforms in the hope of joining the bloc, he said. “I think the fact that no country has joined the European Union for more than 10 years now is causing some people to lose faith,” he said. “I would like to see a number of countries joining the European Union in the period of the next [European] parliament and commission, I think that would send a very strong message to countries in the region,” he said. Commenting on the current pay talks, Mr Varadkar said he was “very disappointed” the Government and public sector unions had not reached an agreement. The proposed 8.5 per cent pay rise over 2½ years had been a “good offer”, but that both sides would now need to show “some degree of flexibility” to reach a deal, he said.",0,1
2024/1/12,"Roscrea: Michael Lowry says Government has no plan for picking asylum accommodation Protest staged at Racket Hall which is to house 160 international protection applicants as local Independent TD says town is ‘overburdened’ Independent TD Michael Lowry has accused the Government of having no policy or plan for sourcing accommodation for asylum seekers and has said the country is “making it up as we go along” Protests have been staged at a hotel in Roscrea, Co Tipperary, which is set to house 160 international protection applicants in Racket Hall on the Dublin Road. Mr Lowry, a TD for Tipperary who frequently supports the Government in key votes such as confidence motions, said the town of Roscrea is “overburdened”. Asked if the matter was serious enough for him to retract his support, he said: “All I can say is that I am not impressed with how the Government are performing. I don’t think they understand that this is chaotic and it is going to get worse.” He said he would consider his support for Government on an “issue by issue basis”. “I raised this four times in the Dáil already because this has been brewing in Roscrea for some time. Hundreds of asylum seekers were put in the Sean Ross Abbey site. They did a complete overhaul and it is literally bulging with asylum seekers, it is full. On top of that we had 400 Ukrainians relocated to Roscrea,” he said, referencing the former Sacred Heart Convent site. “Roscrea is overburdened, all of the facilities are stretched to the limit. You can’t get a doctor. Limerick Hospital is in the Roscrea catchment area, and there is a waiting list to get access to services. It is the same with schools, you can’t find a teacher in the country. Schools in Roscrea are under enormous pressure. You can’t just spring up additional classrooms overnight,” Mr Lowry said. “Overall what has happened is a transformation of the local community. This lodgement of another 160 asylum seekers is a step too far. It is too much. The people of Roscrea are saying enough is enough. The people of Roscrea have been very welcoming and supportive but everyone is overwhelmed.” A protest is due to take place on Saturday afternoon in Roscrea town centre. Speaking on Friday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the opposition and protests in Roscrea were “disappointing”. “Whether people are single, married, or have families or not they need to be accommodated somewhere,” he said. “I know in a number of cases where a decision was taken to prioritise families the protests have ended. What we need to do now in Roscrea is engage with the local community,” he said. Mr Varadkar said he acknowledged that the town had already welcomed “a lot of people” from abroad who were seeking protection. “What we’ll do now through our community engagement teams is to engage with the local community and try to give them any reassurances that they may need,” he said. Meanwhile, the number of international protection applicants awaiting State accommodation is now 569, according to the latest figures from the Department of Integration. Since December 4th, a total of 720 new arrivals have presented seeking accommodation. Accommodation was offered to 82 applicants after an “availability and vulnerability triage”. The Department said 638 international protection applicants received a contingency payment in lieu of accommodation while 69 people were subsequently offered accommodation.",0,1
2024/1/13,"Irish leaders in demand? Government figures linked to top jobs abroad Leo Varadkar, Micheál Martin, Paschal Donohoe and Michael McGrath have all been the subject of job speculation but any departures would deal a severe blow to the Coalition The surprise decision by Charles Michel to step down early as European Council president has set tongues wagging across Europe, and has led to speculation that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Micheál Martin are in the running for the top job. Last weekend, Mr Michel announced that he will run as a candidate in the European Parliament elections in June and if he succeeds – as he is widely expected to – he would take up his seat in July. The job as head of the European Council is an important one: Mr Michel is the convener of the EU’s most powerful body and his role involves mediating between member states and brokering agreements on big global issues. He also represents the bloc on the international stage. EU leaders want to agree a successor by the summer. In this context, the appearance of Varadkar and Martin’s names as potential candidates was not surprising, especially as both have served as taoiseach. But the departure of either party leader from domestic politics would be a hugely significant development that would trigger a potentially divisive leadership campaign in either party. It didn’t take either long to talk down such a prospect. The Taoiseach summarily dismissed speculation that his name could be put forward by saying: “I don’t think I’d be even on the shortlist, even if I wanted to be.” The Tánaiste said: “I’ve made it very clear my ambition and commitment is to lead Fianna Fáil into the next general election.” The comments seemed to put the matter to bed – but sources close to both leaders do not believe the situation to be as black and white. One well-placed source, speaking to The Irish Times, said that if the role was a real possibility for either man, they would genuinely “have to consider” it. While neither has given it any significant degree of thought yet, this could change if they were actually approached in any meaningful way, the source said. As with all top European jobs, there are a number of moving parts that all need to fall into place before the final picture emerges. Firstly, Irish Government sources believe that the European Commission presidency will remain with the European People’s Party, and that Ursula von der Leyen will seek a second term at the helm, which could tilt the European Council job in favour of a socialist or liberal candidate. There is a growing sense within the Coalition that the route to the European Council presidency is clearer for Micheál Martin than it is for Leo Varadkar. Among Mr Martin’s liberal Renew group in Europe, his potential rivals could include Estonia’s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, Luxembourg’s Xavier Bettel, and Belgium’s prime minister Alexander De Croo, who did not rule himself out when recently asked about the role. There may also be a push for a candidate from southern or eastern Europe, which could further dent Mr Martin’s chances. The convoluted processes and behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing make this path to Europe a difficult one to chart. Although the Fianna Fáil leader is increasingly viewed in Government as the Irish candidate with the clearest run, it still appears, for now, an unlikely prospect. There is one certainty in the race for the EU top jobs, however, and that will be the appointment of a European commissioner for the 2024-29 term, after the summer elections. A few names have been bandied about on the international stage, including Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe and current EU Commissioner for Financial Services Mairead McGuinness, who has publicly expressed her willingness to stay on in Brussels for a second term. The Republic’s next European commissioner will be a Fianna Fáil nominee when the Government makes its selection this year, according to an unwritten agreement reached between the Coalition parties in 2020 when they formed the Government. One name believed to be in strong contention for the commissioner role is Minister for Finance Michael McGrath, who has been coy when asked if he would take the job if it offered it. In an interview with The Irish Times after Christmas, Mr McGrath said: “Who knows what the future holds?” Any such move could take him off the pitch as a potential future Fianna Fáil leader, and his is a name that often comes up in such conversations. The speculation about the myriad Irish candidates vying for top EU and international jobs doesn’t end there either. Late last year, Bloomberg reported that Paschal Donohoe’s name was being mentioned as a successor to IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva, should she not continue into a second term in the role. Sources close to Leo Varadkar believe the Taoiseach is very cool on this prospect, and believe that the wider Fine Gael family thinks Donohoe shouldn’t entertain any such move especially given his stature in the party and the proximity to a general election. As is the case for Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin, should either of these job offers come the way of Michael McGrath or Paschal Donohoe, they would have to seriously consider them, and would likely find it hard to wrestle themselves away from a huge opportunity abroad when the tide looks to be turning for Sinn Féin at home.",0,1

The former Government chief whip said support from family and friends has encouraged him to share the news. “As I look forward to 2024 I am sharing with you something a little different but it’s something I wanted to do for a while,” he said in a post on Instagram. “As a politician it can sometimes be difficult to speak about my own personal life and that can lead to things drifting. “However, it’s important for me to be true to myself firstly – and to you all in my public service role. “I am starting 2024 by telling you all that I am proud to say that I am gay. “As a politician and citizen I want to share this today as part of who I am. “Having shared it with many of my close family and friends, their support and love has given me the confidence and courage to share this publicly today. “I am fortunate that Ireland is a country that has made so many strides in recent years,– becoming a much more inclusive and equal society to the extent that the sharing of this information is becoming increasingly unremarkable. “I’m looking forward to a busy, productive and hard working year ahead as a TD for Dublin West along with my Ministerial responsibilities and helping colleagues across the country as Fianna Fáil’s Director of Local Elections 2024.” Mr Chambers is the current Minister of State with responsibility for road safety.",0,1
2024/1/15,"Labour questions whether UK’s Rwanda Bill breaches Belfast Agreement Aodhán Ó Ríordáin has written to Tánaiste after concerns raised with him by British Labour Party Labour has questioned whether the UK government’s contentious Rwanda Bill breaches the Belfast Agreement. In a letter to Tánaiste Micheál Martin, Labour’s justice spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin wrote that concerns had been raised with him by the British Labour Party about “the impact of this proposal on – and its compatibility with – the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol”. Britain is seeking to seek to send asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing. The Conservative government has said that anyone entering the UK illegally could be sent there, with no limit on numbers – but no asylum seeker has been sent yet. The bill would declare Rwanda to be a safe country to which to send migrants, overcoming a key legal obstacle after a previous attempt to set up an immigration deal with the African country floundered in the courts. The bill, Mr Ó Ríordáin wrote, is covered by a note from UK Home Secretary James Cleverly that he is unable to make a statement that in his view the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. “This is because the purpose of the Bill is to severely restrict access to the courts by asylum seekers who want to contest their transfer to Rwanda,” the Dublin Bay North TD told the Tánaiste in a letter sent on Friday. “The Bill would apply throughout the UK, including Northern Ireland.” Mr Ó Ríordáin wrote that there were two “major concerns”. Firstly, there is the compatibility of the Rwanda approach with guarantees in the Belfast Agreement on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity. He also argued that the Northern Ireland Protocol – the deal that governs Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit status – is implemented in part by legislation on the UK’s withdrawal from Europe, under which “EU rights must be recognised and given legal effect in UK law, with access to appropriate remedies”. Mr Ó Ríordáin has asked the Tánaiste if he interprets the Bill as raising any issues of concern in relation to either the Belfast Agreement or the protocol. “If the proposal is of concern, I would like to know if it was discussed with the Irish Government before its introduction or has ben raised by you with your counterparts at any stage since then.”",0,1
2024/1/15,"Latest round of political talks aimed at restoring Stormont ends in deadlock On Thursday more than 170,000 public sector workers will stage mass workout in dispute over pay, a dispute the Northern Secretary says is a ‘devolved matter’  The latest round of political talks aimed at restoring Stormont ahead of unprecedented strike action by public sector workers in Northern Ireland has ended in deadlock. Emerging from the gates of Hillsborough Castle on Monday, Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O’Neill was downbeat, and said there was no “chink of light” following her party’s meeting with Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris. “That being said we still think that there is an opportunity for the DUP to step up to the plate, there is an opportunity for them to end their (Stormont) boycott, and there is an opportunity for the DUP to join the rest of us and form an executive.” Representatives from the North’s five main political parties held separate 45-minute meetings with Mr Heaton-Harris throughout the day, with all filing past dozens of trade union protesters representing teachers. A busload of parents whose autistic children attend special schools were also protested at the gates and loudly heckled Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Jeffrey Donaldson and his entourage as they drove through the castle gates, chanting “you’re paid, pay them”. Next month marks the two-year anniversary of the DUP collapsing the powersharing executive over its concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements, leaving the North with no functioning government. On Thursday more than 170,000 public sector workers – 80 per cent of its workforce – including nurses, teaching assistants and bus and train drivers will stage a mass workout in a dispute over pay. The latest Hillsborough talks took place a month after negotiations between the parties and Northern Secretary ended without resolution despite the UK government offering a £3.3 billion funding package, dependent on Stormont’s return, towards tackling Northern Ireland’s budgetary pressures and public sector pay row. The DUP insisted that separate talks with London on post-Brexit trading were ongoing, and that it could not re-enter the devolved institutions until issues were resolved. The UK government said the talks had “effectively concluded”. Asked on Monday what had changed four weeks on, Mr Donaldson told reporters he was “glad to report” that “further progress” had been made post-Christmas on the “outstanding issues that relate to Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom and its internal market,” The DUP leader spoke to trade union protesters following his meeting with Mr Heaton-Harris, and said that he had pressed him to release public sector funds (around £580 million of the £3.3 billion package) in order to end the pay row and avert Thursday’s strike. “The secretary of state and the treasury have indicated that there is funding available and we’re saying they should now bring that forward and make those public sector pay awards,” he said. Asked by media what will happen if the UK fails to intervene amid threats of civil disobedience by one trade union, Mr Donaldson said: “If the government doesn’t intervene then it looks as if the strike action will go ahead; that is not an outcome I want. I will continue working and I’m going to Westminster later today, and I will engage with ministers specifically on this issue.” He added that he was “working every day” on the political impasse. “I want to see the political institutions restored, I’ve made that absolutely clear, but it has to be on a stable and sustainable basis.” But the Northern Secretary told reporters on Monday that public sector pay was a “devolved matter” and the UK government would not step in to settle the dispute. He added that London had done “everything we can” in talks with the DUP over post-Brexit trading, and that it was “time for decisions to be made”. “It is time for the talking and debate to finish. It is time for Stormont to get back to work,” he said. If Stormont is not restored by this Thursday Mr Heaton-Harris will be legally obliged to call a fresh election. “Various decisions” will have to be made, he said, adding that he would set out his next steps in due course. Tánaiste Micheál Martin also appealed for the restoration of the devolved institutions ahead of an assembly recall by Sinn Féin on Wednesday, the seventh attempt to do since May 2022 but which has been blocked each time by the DUP. “I’m always hopeful of a breakthrough. I think it’s come very close. And I would hope that we would see the assembly restored very quickly,” Mr Martin said on Monday. However, Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie was pessimistic about a return to powersharing following his party’s meeting with Mr Heaton-Harris, and said there was “absolutely no movement whatsoever and nothing has changed”. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long urged the DUP to return but said she realised that her pleas may fall on “deaf ears”. She also warned that patience with Northern Ireland in London was “running out”. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called on the UK government to release funding to make a pay award to public sector workers and said it was “scandalous we’re still at this point”, adding that people were in a “twilight zone waiting for the DUP to make a decision”.",0,1
2024/1/15,"Fine Gael selects James Geoghegan as its candidate for Dublin Bay South Fine Gael has not had a seat in the constituency since Ivana Bacik won Eoghan Murphy’s seat in a byelection in 2021 Fine Gael councillor James Geoghegan has been selected by his party as a general election candidate for the Dublin Bay South constituency. A one-time heartland for Fine Gael support, the party has been without a sitting TD in the constituency since former minister Eoghan Murphy resigned as a TD in 2021. Ivana Bacik, now the Labour Party’s leader, won the seat he previously held in the subsequent byelection that summer. Mr Geoghegan, a councillor in the Pembroke local electoral area, came second in that contest. Party leader, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, said at the time that Mr Geoghegan held the Fine Gael vote in the constituency and is “very well placed to gain a seat in the next general election”. The Dublin Bay South selection convention on Monday night, chaired by Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris, was the first such event held by Fine Gael for the next general election. The election must take place by March next year, though there has been much speculation it will be sooner. The convention saw four councillors compete to get the chance to run in the general election for the party in the usually hotly contested constituency. Emma Blain, a Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown councillor, Fingal councillor Punam Rane and Dublin city councillor Danny Byrne who is based in the southeast Inner City were the unsuccessful candidates. Ms Blain, who currently represents Sandyford-Glencullen, is originally from Rathmines and she is hoping to switch Council in the upcoming local elections in June. She is running in as a candidate in the Pembroke local electoral area of Dublin city Council and she told The Irish Times “my heart lies in Dublin Bay South”. Ms Rane, currently representing Blanchardstown-Mulhuddart, has been living in Dublin Bay South since 2021 and said before the selection convention: “I would like to continue my political career representing Fine Gael in the area that I live in.” While Mr Geoghegan was the only Dáil hopeful selected on Monday night, the party may run more than one candidate in the constituency and could add to the ticket in Dublin Bay South at a later date. Fine Gael had two TDs in Dublin Bay South between 2016 and 2020, Eoghan Murphy and Kate O’Connell. Ms O’Connell lost her seat in the last general election. She did not put her name forward for the byelection nor was she a candidate for selection on Monday night.",0,1
2024/1/16,"Asylum seeker accommodation: Areas most ‘under pressure’ to get extra resources, says Varadkar Ten districts with most international protection applicants and people from Ukraine will get more health, education and policing aid, Taoiseach says The 10 areas most “under pressure” due to the numbers of refugees and asylum seekers being accommodated are to receive extra resources in health, education and policing, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. Speaking to reporters on his way into Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting, Mr Varadkar said he would be asking all Ministers to come together and take the 10 districts in the country that have the highest proportion of people from Ukraine and international protection applicants and “put together a special package to help those areas that are under pressure”. The Taoiseach said the Government now needed to go beyond measures already announced in the Community Recognition Fund – a €50 million cash pile allocated last year for communities hosting large amounts of migrant accommodation. He said he was “very disappointed” at the scenes on Monday in Roscrea, Co Tipperary, where 17 international protection applicants were accommodated at the Racket Hall hotel but were met with protests on arrival, which saw some scuffles between gardaí and protesters – including when children were walking into the hotel. “Ireland is a republic, we’re a democracy and we’re a free country and in a republic and a democracy and a free country people have a right to protest and they have a right to hold views that other people may find objectionable,” Mr Varadkar said. “However, nobody has the right to engage in violence against other individuals, to damage property or to prevent people getting to their home or their work. That’s anti-democratic, that’s anti-freedom, that’s against the spirit and the values of our nation.” He said he understands how people in Roscrea feel, acknowledging that “hundreds of people” had been accommodated in the town in recent years, either from Ukraine or through the international protection programme. “That has put the town under pressure – and I can understand the frustrations that everyday people feel and some of the public reps feel as well,” he said Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman is to hold meetings with local representatives from Tipperary and Roscrea in particular in the coming days, beginning on Tuesday afternoon.",0,1
2024/1/16,"British Labour Party urges Tánaiste to clarify if State has concerns over impact of Rwanda Bill on Belfast Agreement Labour Party wrote to Tánaiste last month raising concerns over effects of Rwanda Bill The British Labour Party has urged Tánaiste Micheál Martin to clarify if the Irish Government has any concerns over Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda Bill jeopardising rights protected by the Belfast Agreement. Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, told The Irish Times that she had not “heard a peep” from Mr Martin, despite writing to him seeking the Coalition’s views over a month ago. The UK Labour Party, and its Irish counterpart, has raised concerns that the terms of the UK’s Rwanda Bill – which seeks to declare the African state to be a safe country to send migrants who enter the UK illegally for processing – could contravene parts of the Belfast Agreement. On Tuesday, Ms Creasy said there was “growing concern” in the UK parliament that the Rwanda Bill “undermines the rights protected by the Good Friday Agreement”, arguing that the DUP has put down an amendment “to ensure that it does”. “That’s why as soon as the bill was published last December we asked the Irish Government for their view because it’s an obligation on us all to act if it’s at risk. Despite all of this, we’ve still not heard a peep as to whether they’ve even asked the UK government about it,” she said. “Time is running out to protect the Good Friday Agreement so I urge them to speak up now to ensure this bedrock of peace in Northern Ireland is not put at risk.” The legislation is at the centre of a political row in London, with the Conservative party split between camps that endorse the new law and two separate groups who respectively feel it is too harsh, or doesn’t go far enough. It is due for a third reading in the House of Commons this week, with Mr Sunak facing the possibility of a rebellion by backbench MPs that could seriously undermine his leadership Ms Creasy wrote to Mr Martin in December saying the legislation would change the role of the European Court of Human Rights as refugees facing removal would be unable to rely on ECHR rights in UK courts, which in turn will “not be able to pay any regard to [ECHR] interim rulings”. “As such, this legislation changes how the UK Government intends to interpret the role of the ECHR in our jurisdiction,” she wrote, asking how the Irish Government would view the approach to the UK’s obligations under international treaties such as the European Convention on Human Rights, which she said has a “key role” in both the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement. She said that the Belfast Agreement explicitly sets out that the British government will incorporate the law of the ECHR into Northern Irish Law “with direct access to the courts and remedies for breach of the Convention”. “I am keen to ensure that as parliamentarians we are able to consider the full impact of this proposed legislation in considering whether it should become law. Given this is being treated as emergency legislation, an urgent response clarifying the position of the Irish Government on this matter would be most welcome,” she wrote to the Tánaiste. On Tuesday, she said no response had been received.",0,1
2024/1/16,"Roscrea standoff: Government agrees ‘in principle’ to purchase disused hotel in town as ‘community hotel’ Purchase part of attempts to defuse tensions over accommodating asylum seekers in local hotel The Government has agreed “in principle” to support a plan to purchase a disused hotel in Roscrea as a “community hotel” as part of moves to defuse tensions over the accommodation of asylum seekers in the town. Jackie Cahill, the Fianna Fáil TD for Tipperary, presented the plan to Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman at a meeting today. Speaking on Tuesday evening, Mr Cahill said that Mr O’Gorman had indicated that there was agreement in principle among the Government parties to support the project and to examine mechanisms, including funding mechanisms, that could be used to support it. Mr O’Gorman has been holding talks to local representatives against the backdrop of tensions in the town after resistance to a plan to accommodate up to 160 asylum seekers in the hotel. “We put forward this proposal today that a community-based hotel would be an ideal solution, with the profits of the hotel going back into the community,” Mr Cahill said. “To me this ticks numerous boxes as regards Government policy, and putting a hotel back in the town centre which can only help with the commercial revitalisation of the town centre,” he said. Mr Cahill said that Fianna Fáil councillor Michael Smith had held discussions with the auctioneer appointed to oversee the sale of the closed hotel with a view to the State purchasing it, refurbishing it and reopening it as a community hotel. “We put it forward and have got agreement on our proposal today,” he added, saying the next step was to try to reach an agreement with the vendor. Protesters have said that the loss of the town’s only remaining hotel  is among their chief grievances arising from its planned use as accommodation for asylum seekers. The proposed site of the community hotel is the former Grant’s Hotel in Roscrea town centre, formerly a 24-bedroom business which has been vacant since it was shut down with the loss of 20 jobs in 2013. There have been calls in recent years for the council to bring the building back into use. Local reports in 2013 said that the hotel building had been sold at auction to a Co Cavan businessman. The proposal  cites the example of a community-owned and managed hotel in Knockatallon, Co Monaghan – the Sliabh Beagh – which was opened in the year 2000 with funding from post Good Friday Agreement funds, as well as other sources. Earlier today Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the 10 areas most “under pressure” due to the numbers of refugees and asylum seekers being accommodated are to receive extra resources in health, education and policing.

2024/1/17,"Businesses with warehoused Covid-era tax liabilities to face relaxed deadlines, lower interest rates Michael McGrath says expectation is that interest rates will fall but scale of these remain to be seen Businesses who warehoused tax liabilities during the Covid-19 pandemic are to be given relaxed deadlines and lower interest rates for repaying their debts under plans being developed by the Government. Speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Minister for Finance Michael McGrath said that around €1.75 billion in back taxes was owed by firms who took advantage of Covid-era scheme to defer some tax liabilities for payment at a future date. Around 7,000 businesses owe money to the Revenue Commissioners. Mr McGrath said the Government was “really anxious” to ensure viable businesses were supported and would remain in operation. “We are going to make some changes to the tax warehousing regime with a view to being as flexible as we possibly can,” he said. “I’ve been engaging with the Revenue Commissioners and a proposal is currently being developed which we hope to finalise very shortly to introduce further flexibility in relation to the specific terms associated with the tax warehousing regime.” The Minister urged businesses to engage with the Revenue Commissioners, who he said would be flexible, and to put in place a repayment plan which could run over an extended period of time “and on attractive terms”.  He added that existing tax liabilities and returns must be kept up to date but warehoused taxes would be treated differently. He said that there was a recognition that entering into a “onerous” repayment plan would be challenging.  Around €1.5 billion of the total is owed by 5,000 of the businesses, typically owing more than €50,000. “Those are the businesses that we’re most concerned about, and we want to make sure that they are supported provided they engage in a genuine and open way with the Revenue Commissioners,” the Fianna Fáil TD said.  The duration and interest rate of repayment plans was being considered and it is hoped proposals can be finalised within the next fortnight, he added. Asked about comments by Christine Lagarde, managing director of the European Central Bank, who said she expected interest rates had peaked this year barring any unexpected shocks, Mr McGrath said Ireland would take its guidance from market expectations which were that there would be rate reductions. However, he said the timing and scale of these remained to be seen. “Overall I’m optimistic for the outlook for the Irish economy this year,” he added. “I do believe we will have economic growth this year, it will be at a more modest level than we have had in recent years but against the backdrop of international uncertainty, conflict, geopolitical tension, the impact of inflation and high interest rates.”",0,1

On Monday, a motion was passed at Mayo County Council calling on local authority staff to immediately cease co-operation with the Department of Integration in relation to housing refugees and asylum seekers. It was passed unanimously with councillors from Government parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, among those backing the motion. However, management at the local authority has not given a commitment to implement the non-cooperation demand with a statement saying: “the content of the resolution adopted by Council remains under consideration.” The Department of Integration said it will continue to work with Mayo County Council. Fine Gael leader Mr Varadkar said: “my understanding is that the motion was non-binding so it’s a motion that was passed by the councillors but has no effect”. Asked for his response to the motion and Fine Gael councillors supporting it, Mr Varadkar said: “I didn’t hear about this until the motion passed and had gone through. “But certainly what I’ll be saying to the Fine Gael team in Mayo and everyone at Mayo County Council is it’s not the case that you can have an a la carte relationship with Government departments, refuse to co-operate with some when you’re asked to do something, and then apply for funding from five others. “That’s not a tenable position.” He said local authorities get funding from central Government Departments such as Transport and Environment and “Mayo County Council is one that would receive very significant grants”. Meanwhile, Mr Varadkar said he has asked Ministers to put together a package to support places that are under the most pressure due to the arrival of refugees and asylum seekers. The intention is for the plans to be ready in time for approval at the first Cabinet meeting in February. Ten locations around the country are to be provided with a special package of supports that could see extra resources given for health, education and policing. It comes amid concern within Government about the increasing number of protests outside buildings due to be used to accommodate asylum seekers and refugees. Mr Varadkar did not offer an indication of the funding involved. He noted there is an existing Community Recognition Fund and said: “one option is opening that to new applications or finding ways to make it more flexible because there has been some difficulty in drawing down some of the existing money and getting some of the existing projects off the ground.” He said he has also asked the departments of Health, Education and Justice in particular to see what they can do in relation to primary care access, schools and policing resources.",0,1

Farming organisations were very happy on this occasion with the news that beef exports to China could resume immediately, after they were suspended last November due to a case of atypical BSE. The reopening market was one of the “tangible” outcomes of the talks, Varadkar said. Li, seen as the second most powerful politician in China after president Xi Jinping, arrived fresh from the World Economic Forum in Davos on the biggest passenger jet ever to land at Dublin Airport on Tuesday evening accompanied by a legion of officials. A frozen Phoenix Park was closed to traffic for 24 hours due to the engagements in Áras an Uachtaráin and Farmleigh. Some 28 journalists also travelled. Chinese state news organisations present included the People’s Daily, the official organ of the Chinese Communist Party. With less than 24 hours in Dublin the Chinese press corps did not have much time for sightseeing. However, the media bus passing the Guinness brewery prompted a murmur of excitement and the odd mobile phone snap. There was not a great deal of interaction between the Irish and Chinese press contingent, some of whom at least were reluctant to offer views on their impression of Ireland and the visit of their prime minister. But then, freedom of the press is not exactly something that China is known for. Human rights matters were broached by President Michael D Higgins and Varadkar during their respective meetings with Li. Varadkar said he “raised our concerns about the situation in Xinjiang, in Tibet and Hong Kong ... and also the forthcoming trial of [Hong Kong newspaper publisher] Jimmy Lai”. The Taoiseach said afterwards the Chinese government was willing to have the issues raised but “would have a very different view of the facts and would dispute a lot of what has been said about China in the media”. Human rights were not the main focus of talks. Bilateral relations, trade and economic ties, climate change, the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine were all discussed. In his toast before lunch Varadkar hailed 45 years of diplomatic relations, “flourishing people-to-people ties” and “cultural exchange”. Chinese students studying the works of WB Yeats and Riverdance performing in China this spring got a mention later. Varadkar told the Chinese prime minister: “Of course we won’t find agreement on everything but I hope we’ll always speak frankly and respectfully to each other and candidly as we did today.”",0,1
2024/1/18,"Varadkar says there will be arrests over recent arson attacks on asylum seeker accommodation Taoiseach insists that Ireland is not a racist country and that the political climate around migration has changed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said there will be arrests in relation to the recent spate of arson attacks on properties linked to asylum seekers in Ireland. There have been almost 20 attacks or threats of violence on accommodation for asylum seekers in total since 2018, with about half of them having occurred in 2023. Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr Varadkar also insisted that Ireland was not a racist country or that the political climate had changed in response to the arrival of more than 100,000 refugees fleeing war-torn Ukraine. “There are a number of Garda investigations under way [into the attacks] and there have been people questioned and searches have been carried out,” he said. “The gardaí have told me that they anticipate there will be arrests in relation to arson attacks around the country,” Mr Varadkar said. “Arson is a serious crime and comes with a sentence of up to 10 years and I have a real worry that an arson attack might occur in a building with somebody inside it,” he said. Mr Varadkar’s comments come following increasing tensions and arson attacks on proposed accommodation centres for asylum seekers. On Thursday, it emerged that a disused convent in Co Longford will no longer be used as a centre for Ukrainian refugees following an attempted arson attack this week. Lanesboro Convent was targeted on Tuesday night by suspected anti-immigrant protesters who used accelerant to start the fire. Longford Fire Brigade doused the flames quickly and there was little damage done to the convent, which is in the middle of the town. The Longford attack is the latest in a string of attacks and vandalism on accommodation centres. At the beginning of the new year, arsonists destroyed the disused Shipwright pub in Ringsend, south Dublin, after it was falsely linked to asylum seekers. Two weeks earlier, Ross Lake House hotel in Rosscahill, Galway, which had been earmarked for asylum seekers, was largely destroyed by a fire. During the riots in the capital in November, two premises previously used to house asylum seekers were attacked. Asked if these attacks or the recent riots in Dublin had tempered the appetite, among business leaders, for investing in Ireland, the Fine Gael leader said the topic had not been raised with him in Davos. However, he acknowledged there was rising concern about migration in Ireland. “Some of that is understandable and [involves] legitimate concerns, that shouldn’t be dismissed ... in somes cases it’s not, in some cases, there’s an element of racism to it, quite frankly,” he said. He also denied political climate around immigration had changed, saying “this issue has been rising for some time and it’s not something that’s just changed overnight”. “I don’t think by any means Ireland is a racist country, the vast majority of people in Ireland are willing to judge people by the content of their character, to see them as individuals, not as a group,” he said. Mr Varadkar is due to speak on a panel about the potential and risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI) while meeting various political and business leaders. On Wednesday night he gave the keynote address at an IDA-hosted dinner and was seated beside Sam Altman, chief executive and founder of ChatGPT company OpenAI. Mr Varadkar said it was very nice to meet Mr Altman but would not disclose the content of their conversation.",0,1
2024/1/18,"China confirms resumption of Irish beef exports and easing of travel rules Higgins and Varadkar raise Irish concerns about human rights in China during visit by Chinese premier Li Qiang Irish beef exports to China can resume immediately after the Chinese government confirmed it would reopen its market during the visit to Dublin of premier Li Qiang. The announcement was made by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar after his meeting with Mr Li, who is widely seen as the second most powerful figure in China after president Xi Jinping. Bilateral relations including trade and economic ties, EU-China relations and issues such as climate change and wars in the Middle East and Ukraine were on the agenda for the talks between Mr Varadkar and Mr Li during his one-day visit to Ireland. Both President Michael D Higgins and Mr Varadkar also raised Irish concerns about human rights in China with Mr Li. The Chinese market was closed to Irish beef last November after the detection of atypical BSE in a cow during a routine check by the Department of Agriculture. The reopening has occurred much more quickly than a previous 2020 scare related to BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease, which saw exports to China suspended for 2½ years. The news that exports can resume was welcomed by the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA). Irish beef exports to China are a small fraction of the more than €2.7 billion worth of beef Ireland shipped internationally last year, though the Government hopes the business there will grow. The exports to China were worth €38.8 million in 2019 before the May 2020 suspension and some €25 million between April and October, the short period during which access to the market had been restored. The Taoiseach said China had accepted Ireland’s scientific data that the BSE case was an atypical case. “That allows us to reopen that export market which is important for Irish farmers ... the more markets we have, the better price we get and the less risk of volatility as well,” he said. Mr Varadkar said the resumption of market access was one of two “tangible outcomes” from the meeting with Mr Li. The other was China liberalising its travel rules for Irish citizens, who will be allowed to stay for up to 15 days without a visa. Mr Li began his engagements in Dublin with a meeting with Mr Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin which featured a discussion on climate change, global poverty, food security and conflict. Speaking through a translator during a brief exchange open to the media, Mr Li told Mr Higgins that co-operation between China and Ireland “has made steady progress and produced rich fruits”. He added: “Our relations have set a good example of mutually beneficial co-operation between countries that are different in political systems, cultural divisions and geographic size.” Human rights organisations have long criticised China’s treatment of the Muslim Uyghur people of Xinjiang province and a crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong. Áras an Uachtaráin confirmed that human rights matters were discussed during the talks, with Mr Higgins referencing points likely to come up at this month’s Universal Periodic Review on China by the United Nations Human Rights Council. After his meeting with Mr Li in Farmleigh Mr Varadkar said he had “raised our concerns about the situation in Xinjiang, in Tibet and Hong Kong ... and also the forthcoming trial of [Hong Kong newspaper publisher] Jimmy Lai.” Mr Varadkar said the Irish concerns over human rights relate to issues in China’s Special Autonomous Regions and Ireland’s view is “we needed to be frank about these things, that China is on the UN Human Rights Council and has international responsibilities”. Mr Varadkar added: “Any country, including our own country, should be judged by the way it treats minorities.” Asked about Mr Li’s response Mr Varadkar said the Chinese delegation were willing to have such issues raised but also said: “It’s fair to say that they would have a very different view of the facts and would dispute a lot of what has said about China in the media.”",0,1
2024/1/18,"Germany seeing Israel-Gaza conflict through ‘prism’ of Holocaust, Tánaiste says Micheál Martin calls on Israel to focus on ending conflict quickly and says Hamas must ‘lay down their arms’ during visit to Berlin Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has described Germany’s position on the Israel-Gaza conflict as “evolving” but “still constrained by the historical prism” of the Holocaust. He was speaking in Berlin where his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, praised the two countries’ “close and deep” bilateral relationship but acknowledged that each had “because of its own history, its own particular gaze” towards the Middle East conflict. At a joint conference Mr Martin insisted that Israel must “focus on how you end this as quickly as possible” and Hamas must “lay down their arms”. “The danger is you create so much hate ... which does not augur well for the future and trying to build peace,” said Mr Martin. “We are horrified to see the children of Gaza dying in this manner.” Ms Baerbock agreed that everything must be tried to “end the suffering on both sides” but that 130 Israeli hostages – including children and people with disabilities – remained in the hands of Hamas. “At the moment we are in a terrible dilemma in which one’s suffering can only end when the other’s ends,” she said. “If we are to reach peace it can only come when Hamas lays down its weapons so the people of Israel are safe and such terror can never recur.” Using the friendly “du” form with her guest, the German foreign minister recalled with “heartfelt thanks” Operation Shamrock, Ireland’s postwar aid effort for German children, and its modern echo in generous Irish help for Ukrainian refugees. Mr Martin thanked Germany for its “steadfast solidarity” during the Brexit process and promised closer co-operation on climate and green energy. His German host agreed that close bilateral co-operation at Cop28 in Dubai secured an “ambitious result” on the so-called “loss and damage fund” to compensate those most affected by climate change. Speaking earlier, Mr Martin said the “appalling acts of Hamas cannot be condemned enough” but he criticised, too, the “collective punishment of Gaza civilians” by Israel in the last three months. Three months after the October 7th attacks, he observed a “growing consistency in the EU towards a cessation that wouldn’t have been there at the beginning”. “If the EU is not consistent in how it responds to the appalling acts of violence perpetrated on entirely innocent people in both conflicts,” he said, “then no amount of internal reforms or institutional changes will undo the irreparable damage which we will – and indeed may already be inflicting – on the European Union’s international reputation and credibility.” During a keynote address and discussion in Berlin, he pushed back against efforts to reduce the number of European commissioners as part of a reform package linked to further EU enlargement. He told his Berlin audience how Ireland’s first Lisbon Treaty referendum in 2008 failed due to political “complacency” over voter concerns stoked up by the No camp, including the potential loss of the Irish commissioner. While Berlin and other capitals believe having 30-plus commissioners, one for every member state, would make an enlarged EU administration unwieldy, Mr Martin said “there are lots of areas you can have commissioners working on”. “I’m not sure we have to concede our commissioner because in Lisbon that proved to be an issue in retrospect,” said Mr Martin. He predicted “harder decisions” ahead over whether to shift further towards majority voting rather than unanimity. While smaller countries such as Ireland fear being outvoted with so-called qualified majority voting (QMV), Hungary’s use of vetoes over EU aid to Ukraine had increased pressure for change. Personally, Mr Martin is “cautious but open” to change as he had “seen in the case of Hungary at the moment that it is the wrong use of the veto”. Asked if he favoured new tools to expel renegade member states from the union, the Tánaiste said the idea was “worth exploring, I wouldn’t say no to that”. Even countries with populist anti-EU governments, he warned, might have large numbers of pro-EU citizens. During his Berlin visit Mr Martin met members of the Bundestag European affairs committee and attended the opening concert of Zeitgeist Irland 24, a year-long programme of Irish arts and culture. More than 110 events involving more than 400 artists and arts professionals are scheduled to take place around Germany throughout the year, co-funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Culture Ireland. Thursday night’s concert at Berlin’s historic Metropol theatre brought together artists including composer Jennifer Walshe, dancers Sheena McGrandles and Tura, and musicians Aoife Ní Bhriain and Ye Vagabonds. The evening had a touch of showbiz drama when mezzo-soprano Tara Erraught was called away at short notice. Stepping in was Irish tenor Dean Power, who lived in Munich for 11 years. “In my line of business you get used to dropping things and changing your plans,” he joked. “Germany has been so welcoming to generations of Irish people over the years, it is wonderful now that Zeitgeist gives us a platform and a chance for our work to be performed.”",0,1
2024/1/18,"Number believed to have received Pandemic Unemployment Payment while working more than doubles  Up to 60,000 may have received PUP while in employment, Public Accounts Committee told The number of people believed to have received the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) at times they were working has “increased quite significantly”, with the estimate more than doubling to between 50,000 and 60,000 people. A report published last year by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) outlined how the Department of Social Protection estimated that about 20,000 people received the PUP at times they were working and there was the possibility of recovering up to €70 million. Department secretary general John McKeon told the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that more than €16 million has been recovered so far. He also provided an update on the number of instances of overlap with people receiving the PUP while they were working. Mr McKeon said it had “increased quite significantly” after a detailed analysis that involved cross-checking all the payments of the PUP week by week against employment records. He said: “We’re now looking at between 50,000 and 60,000 cases where there is an overlap.” Mr McKeon said that in some cases that’s a “legitimate overlap”. He said: “Pandemic Unemployment Payment was paid on a full-week basis. “If somebody went back to work on a Monday, that was the legislation, they still got the payment for that week. “So there’s a bit of filtering still to be done. “But we’d estimate that – and this would be a very cautious estimate – if every single one of them was a legitimate overlap you’re looking at about €200 million. “It won’t work out at being €200 million. But we’re now setting up a unit in our office in Sligo where they’ll spend the next year contacting all the people involved, making checks with them.” Fianna Fáil TD Paul McAuliffe raised concern that people who had never received social welfare before the PUP, and were then overpaid, might be faced with the repayment in a lump sum when they next engaged with the department. He gave the example of when they become entitled to their State pension. Mr McAuliffe said it would not be appropriate to write off the debt but a lump sum being sought upon retirement would not be appropriate either. Mr McKeon told him: “You’re singing our tune.” He noted that the C&AG report highlighted “the need to communicate with people to let them know their status in terms of debts and so on, and that’s something we’re continuously looking at”. He said the department intends to automate that process with a yearly reminder to people that they have a debt related to an overpayment. Mr McKeon added: “We mightn’t be chasing you for it now but remember the next time you come in we might.” He confirmed that if people did not repay the debt during their working life, the intention would be to recoup the money when they next engaged with the department. He said letters on PUP overpayments will be sent out “fairly soon” and people will be offered and opportunity to repay in full or agree a repayment plan in instalments. He said “most of the overpayments are probably a couple of hundred euro rather than thousands”. Mr McKeon there is an online option for repaying with bank cards, not credit cards, and if people were paying in instalments, it would be low amounts. Earlier C&AG Seamus McCarthy outlined wider welfare overpayments where a claimant either receives a payment they are not entitled to, or the level of payment exceeds their entitlement. He said: “The total value of overpayments raised in recent years has been relatively stable, in the range €100 million to €125 million per annum.” Mr McCarthy said his report on the matter “recommended that the department seek further opportunities to engage with claimants, to make them aware of their responsibilities to inform the department of any changes in their circumstances that could affect their payment entitlements”. He said: “At the end of December 2022, the department had total outstanding overpayment debt of €495 million.” Mr McCarthy said he recommended that the Department carry out a formal review of the reasons why debt may not be recoverable in an effort to reduce the requirement for debt write-offs in future periods. His report also recommended that the department expedite the raising of overpayment debt arising from excess payments issued under the PUP scheme. Mr McKeon said his department has accepted the various recommendations in the C&AG report.",0,1
2024/1/18,"Government seeking to delay Bill that would provide paid leave for women who experience early pregnancy loss Minister of State says Government wanted Bill to be debated in 12 months to allow time for development of legislative proposals The Government is seeking to delay for a year progressing a Bill that would provide paid leave for women who experience early pregnancy loss. The Labour Party’s Bill sets out for up to 20 days paid leave for any woman who experiences an early pregnancy loss and up to 10 days for all people seeking to access fertility treatments such as IVF. The Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021 was debated in the Dáil on Thursday. Minister of State Neale Richmond said the Government wanted the Bill to be put forward for debate at second stage again in 12 months time to allow sufficient time for the development of legislative proposals. Mr Richmond said it was not a decision the Government had come to “lightly”, but there were steps “we have to take in order to ensure this is done properly”. The Dublin-Rathdown TD said a research study commissioned by the Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman, which examined the workplace experience of people dealing with pregnancy loss before 24 weeks gestation, had only just been completed. Labour leader Ivana Bacik said it is estimated that around 14,000 women experience pregnancy loss each year and that maternity protection law currently only offers leave to those who endure this experience after 24 weeks. Ms Bacik said there had been an “outpouring of correspondence” since the Bill was first introduced in 2021 from women across the country who had suffered pregnancy loss and couples trying to balance work commitments with IVF treatment. “I’ve received such personal and poignant messages from women struggling to conceive, having to undergo successive cycles of IVF without success, from women who’ve experienced miscarriage early and not so early, up to 24 weeks is simply not recognised in our workplaces, there’s no entitlement,” she said. “Women have to take sick leave, had to take unpaid leave in order to recover from their experience.” The Dublin Bay South TD added it was a “widespread issue” but also “an unspoken one”. Ms Bacik said the Bill passed all stages in the Seanad, and had Government support there, while hoped it would accept the Bill at second stage and work with her party to bring it into law. “We’re very disappointed to see the Government seeking to delay this Bill by 12 months, when we know that an election likely have taken place in 12 months, certainly within 14 months will have had to take place and yet the second reading of the Bill is to be delayed by 12 months,” she added. “There’s no reality therefore if the Government’s amendment is accepted of this Bill becoming law in the term of this Government. That’s deeply disappointing, not for us in Labour so much but for all of those who are so clearly and desperately affected.”",0,1
2024/1/18,"17,000 Ukrainians now in full-time employment in Ireland, TDs told Figure described as an ‘extraordinarily high’ rate given the proportion of refugees that are women with childcare needs Some 17,000 Ukrainian people are now in full-time employment in Ireland, an “extraordinarily high” rate given the proportion of refugees that are women with childcare needs, TDs have been told. Department of Social Protection secretary general John McKeon told the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that around 30 per cent of Ukrainian adults in Ireland are in employment. He also told the meeting that the Department’s case officers would say Ukrainian refugees are “more eager to engage [with employment support services] than perhaps some of the other people that we would deal with.” Mr McKeon told said that the Department’s Covid-19 related work has abated but it continues to “devote significant energy, time and resources in response to the Ukrainian crisis and inflationary pressures.” Around 103,000 personal public service numbers (PPSNs) have been issued to Ukrainian people since the Russian invasion of their home country in 2022 with an estimated 80,000 of the refugees believed to still be in Ireland. Around a quarter of this number are children, with the Department paying child benefit for 21,000 children. The PAC was told that most of the welfare payments to Ukrainian refugees must be collected in person at post offices. Total expenditure to date on welfare supports and services to Ukrainian refugees is estimated at €650 million. The Government has signed off on plans to significantly reduce social welfare payments for future arrivals from Ukraine who are allocated state-provided, serviced accommodation as part of the response to the shortage of housing for refugees Adult Ukrainians are offered employment support service and around 35,000 are attending, Mr McKeon said. A further 8,000 referred to programmes such as Community Employment, Back to Education and Tús. Mr McKeon said that Revenue figures suggest are 24,000 employments among Ukrainian people including part-time jobs. He said the number in full-time employment is 17,000. Fine Gael TD Colm Burke said he had heard of cases of people who are not inclined to take up employment due to the benefits they are receiving. Mr McKeon said: “That’s not our experience I have to say.” He said three quarters of the refugees are women and children adding: “You’ve got women living in hotel rooms in the west of Ireland, three to a room, a woman and two children, who has child care responsibilities and so on. “The employment rate is about 30 per cent. That’s an extraordinarily high employment rate for people in that situation.” The PAC was told that 5,500 Ukrainians are working in the hospitality sector, just under 3,000 in retail, 2,000 in manufacturing, just over 1,500 in support sectors and 1,000 in construction. Mr McKeon said there are around 100 Ukrainians working in the Department of Social Protection “and we’re delighted to have them” with 36 more moving from there to permanent jobs elsewhere in the Civil Service. He added: “I suspect the construction firms that have the 1,000 Ukrainians are delighted to have the construction staff as would be the [more than] 5,000 in hospitality.” He said there was “no evidence” for the scenario Mr Burke described adding “if I was to say anything our own case officers would say they’re more eager to engage than perhaps some of the other people that we would deal with.” Separately Mr McKeon said some €2.4 billion has been spent on the increased welfare payments and one-off supports introduced by Government to ease the cost-of-living crisis caused by inflation. He said (Economic and Social Research Institute) ESRI research has shown the measures have “substantially” cushioned people on low incomes form the effects of inflation. He added: “While there are differing views on the appropriate balance between base-rate increases and one-off payments the approach taken to date has increased incomes of people reliant on welfare by more than an inflation-adjusted amount with a significant proportion of the increase timed to coincide with he winter/spring period when cost pressures are highest.”",0,1
2024/1/19,"Varadkar warns over previous ‘false dawns’ of Northern Ireland power-sharing return Talks among senior DUP figures on whether to back a deal to return to Stormont end without decision Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned that there have been several “false dawns” in the past when it came to hopes power-sharing would be restored in Northern Ireland. Senior Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) figures’ discussions on potentially ending their Stormont boycott ended on Friday without reaching a formal decision. The calling of the party officers meeting came amid mounting speculation that the DUP is preparing to make a call on whether or not to accept a UK government deal on post-Brexit trading arrangements, to restore the Northern Ireland Executive. The devolved institutions at Stormont have been collapsed for almost two years as a result of a DUP boycott in protest at the Brexit-linked economic barriers on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Speaking in Galway on Friday, Mr Varadkar said he could not shed any light on internal discussions within the DUP. “I don’t want to raise expectations, there have been quite a number of false dawns in terms of getting the executive operating again,” he said. “I think what we would all like to see is the Assembly and the executive up and running, [there are] really serious issues that need to be dealt with in Northern Ireland, so we would like to see devolution working again ... Of course the Irish Government is ready and willing to help out in any way that we can,” he said. The Fine Gael leader said the Government was not involved in recent talks around the post-Brexit trading rules in Northern Ireland. “No changes have been sought to the Windsor Framework from the UK side and there is no negotiations underway in that regard,” he said. “There could be maybe things that could be done on a bilateral level within the United Kingdom that might give some reassurance to the DUP, but that’s a matter for the UK government,” he added. Downing Street expressed hope the Stormont impasse could soon be resolved. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said before Christmas that his negotiations with the DUP over the terms of the Windsor Framework had concluded. Although the party has been holding out since then for more clarification on the British government’s proposals, it appears to be approaching the juncture when it decides whether to reject or accept the deal that would end the powersharing deadlock. One senior DUP source said: “It is clear that the time for a decision has arrived. The negotiation is over.” Senior civil servants are currently running devolved departments, with limited powers, in the absence of local ministers. Any proposed return to Stormont would be expected to be strongly opposed by some of the DUP’s 12 party officers who have made clear that devolution should only be restored when all of their concerns over the Irish Sea trading border have been addressed. The officer board includes senior figures such as party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, deputy leader Gavin Robinson, senior peer Lord Dodds and longstanding MPs Sammy Wilson and Gregory Campbell. A DUP spokesman declined to comment on the meeting. “We understand that there has considerable interest in our meeting today,” he said. “We will not give a running commentary on our position, save to say, we will continue to engage with the government.” Expectations had been raised before Christmas that the DUP could be poised to return to powersharing, but it did not materialise. The UK government has offered a £3.3 billion package to stabilise Northern Ireland’s finances, including £600 million to settle public sector pay claims in Northern Ireland. However, Mr Heaton-Harris has made clear that the funds can only be released when the powersharing institutions return. Thousands of public sector workers took part in strike action on Thursday, where calls were made for Mr Heaton-Harris to release the funds for pay claims and for the DUP to return to Stormont. On Thursday, a legislative deadline passed for the restoration of the Stormont Assembly. As a result, any imminent return of the Assembly would first require new legislation to be tabled at Westminster. A Downing Street spokeswoman said she would not speculate on political party meetings. “Our focus has always been on delivering for the people of Northern Ireland who rightly expect locally elected decision-makers to address the issues that matter to them,” she added. “We also think we have a strong basis for the restoration of powersharing, so we hope this can be fixed soon.” A DUP spokesperson said: “We understand that there has considerable interest in our meeting today. We will not give a running commentary on our position, save to say, we will continue to engage with the government.” - Additional reporting PA",0,1
2024/1/19,"More than 500 new student beds to go into construction this year Extra beds come as Government announces €61m for first phase of new student accommodation scheme More than 500 new student beds will go to construction this year, as the Government announced new long-term plans to develop student accommodation. On Friday, Minister for Higher and Further Education Simon Harris announced new State funding for student accommodation with €61 million being made available for the first phase of the scheme. Up to 1,000 student beds will be supported under the first phase across Dublin City University (DCU), Maynooth University, University of Limerick and University of Galway. Some 521 of those beds – 405 in DCU and 116 in Maynooth University – are at tender stage and are expected to go into construction this year. These are part-funded by the State and Mr Harris said the Government will work with each university with regard to how much State funding is needed to make the development viable. Funding is to be provided on the basis that a portion of beds will be ring-fenced for disadvantaged students and provided at below-market rents. There will also be a standardised design which, Mr Harris said, could speed up the delivery of accommodation. The second phase of the scheme will see technological universities submit proposals for the development of student accommodation. “This policy will help increase the supply of student housing in campuses across the country but will also help prevent students competing with families for private rental accommodation,” Mr Harris said. Speaking at the launch, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien said supply is key to addressing housing needs. “Today’s announcement points to even more supply and is the result of close collaboration across Government,” Mr O’Brien said. “We know that for every student space that is created it helps to ease the pressure in the private rental market and both I and my department will work with Minister [Simon] Harris and his department in significantly scaling up this supply.” Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said the policy is designed to “better meet students’ housing needs”. “This, in turn, aims to improve the level of housing stock for others in the community; families, couples, other workers, as they will ultimately not be competing for the same premises,” Mr Donohoe said. “It should also provide students with greater certainty and affordability when it comes to securing a place to live during the academic year.”",0,1
2024/1/2,"‘Utter nonsense’: Eamon Ryan criticises false stories about him that spread online – and in the Dáil A Limerick TD claimed the Green Party leader sent a State car to the city with his bicycle in the boot Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has criticised “utter nonsense” false stories about him which went “viral” and were accepted as “gospel”, while warning of the challenge of disinformation online. In pre-Christmas remarks given to political reporters, Mr Ryan criticised two stories which had circulated in recent years that had no factual basis. Mr Ryan referenced a claim made in the Dáil by Independent TD for Limerick County, Richard O’Donoghue, that he had come to Limerick by train and sent a State car with his bicycle in the boot – something the Dublin Bay South TD later dismissed. Mr Ryan said the story was “utter nonsense and it went viral”. The Green Party leader also raised a story published by an outlet about him in 2021 which claimed a nephew of his had run a bike hire service in Offaly, which was not correct – the person concerned not being related to Mr Ryan. “There’s another story in the midlands and Offaly that I was responsible for someone losing their bike franchise. It was absolutely accepted as gospel. Complete and utter nonsense, untrue,” he said, adding: “There is an issue at the moment in the disinformation, viral world where ‘what is the truth, where does the truth lie?’ – and you won’t counter that.” Mr Ryan suggested he would not spend time on social media battling against the claims and that the “antidote” was to invest in “good quality journalism”. “The disinformation and the kind of conspiracy theories that are out there is a real part of the thing we have to challenge, have to meet,” he said. He said some of the commentary online was “really toxic” and not reflective of Irish people’s views. He said that the issue of climate had become divisive in the United States and elsewhere, which had been accentuated by social media – something he said had to be avoided in Ireland. “It’s difficult because you have an online world where it’s used in this toxic, divisive, polarising way,” the Green Party leader said. He argued that it is the job of the political system to counter disinformation, promising more engagement on climate topics in 2024 – including with the agricultural sector, which he said was the “most difficult” area facing the Government. During these engagements, he promised to admit to some of the uncertainties regarding issues such as land use and the measurement of carbon in soil. “Let’s sit down and work together to work out a way in which we can benefit Irish farming by doing this. Starting by admitting that the science keeps changing, on land use particularly, and have a conversation. And I think that approach would see us avoiding going down the American divisive way.”",0,1
2024/1/20,"On the frontline on immigration: the tensions between local and national politics Ministers expect their local election candidates to put some water between themselves and the Government An unorthodox proposal which landed on Tuesday during a meeting about accommodation for asylum seekers in Co Tipperary took Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman by surprise “[It] knocked him off balance,” said a person familiar with the meeting. “He expected a shopping list for various organisations in the town.” Fianna Fáil representatives for Tipperary – Jackie Cahill TD and Cllr Michael Smith – outlined something different altogether – a plan for a “community hotel” in Roscrea. The town had been the centre of controversy and protests – including clashes with gardaí – since the previous weekend over plans to accommodate 160 asylum seekers in the Racket Hall hotel. There were criticisms about a lack of consultation but also about the town being left without a functioning hotel. The “community hotel” plan – modelled after a similar scheme in Co Monaghan – was for the State to fund the purchase of a disused hotel in Roscrea – to be run by locals, with profits reinvested in the town. It was quickly escalated through Coalition ranks. O’Gorman briefed the three party leaders and he had sent Cahill a text by that evening to say there had been an agreement “in principle” to support the proposal. The announcement seemed to go some way to breaking the fever that had developed in the town – although some protesters remained at Racket Hall, with some expressing scepticism. As the State has scrambled to provide accommodation for thousands of refugees and asylum seekers, protests like Roscrea have become commonplace. Local concerns have been fanned by far-right actors, online and in person. The previous week it was in Carlow town – before that, Ballinrobe. In an election year, migration politics is being imprinted on daily political life. “My phone has been hopping for the last two to three weeks,” said Cllr Tom O’Neill, Fine Gael mayor of Carlow, who saw protests dissipate only when the Government said it would accommodate families, not single men, at a building in the town. People call to his house, they ring late at night and while the majority are reasonable, a small element can be difficult, he said. Cahill agreed: “Some people will be very polite and ring and disagree and be fine. Others would be malicious and threatening, and some wouldn’t have the gumption to put their name to their threats.” Cahill said he was told in no uncertain terms he had to go to protest last week. He said a caller also told him: “We’ll burn Racket Hall at the first opportunity and we don’t care whether there’s people in it or not.” The TD reported the warning to An Garda Síochána, and stayed away from the protest. The demonstrations have forced the Government to enter deal-making mode, promising extra money for communities hosting large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers. “I’ve been told by Cabinet Ministers: ‘Come to me with a shopping list for Roscrea,’” said Cahill. Amid unrelenting pressure, there is an imperative for the Coalition to make it clear there is a dividend for communities – and for those politicians who hold the line. However, the underlying dynamic isn’t changing. “Accommodation is exceptionally tight and where it’s available it will be utilised,” said a senior source during the week. A new plan is promised, focused on larger centres. The hope is that politicians on the ground will be able to credibly argue the situation is not permanent, a plan is coming, and that improved communications will help. Privately, however, Government sources admit: “The problem is a plan is just a plan. The biggest factor is not really under our control – the number of arrivals.” Maintaining party discipline in the face of unrelenting pressure will be a challenge with local and European elections coming in the summer and a general election widely expected later in the year. Peter Flynn is a Fine Gael councillor and party whip on Mayo County Council, which this week passed a motion to suspend work with the International Protection Accommodation Services. The outworkings of this are unclear, but Flynn is sharply critical of the Government’s approach being focused on the private sector. “It’s being led by faceless opportunists,” he said, calling accommodation centres “profit centres”. “There has been no strategy on this,” he said, adding that he was coming under pressure over the impact on the tourist trade and from people associating the issue with the housing crisis (asylum seekers are not housed in social housing or the rental sector). Flynn has received no missive from Fine Gael headquarters about the motion. A senior party source indicated it would tolerate criticism and questions from within the party being expressed publicly – to a point. “The line is anything racist or spreading misinformation or conspiracy theories.” Fianna Fáil initiated disciplinary proceedings against two councillors who commented on an arson attack in Co Galway last year. Asked for an update on the proceedings, it said the matter is currently being examined by the party’s rules and procedures committee and it would be inappropriate to comment further. National politicians are sympathetic to the pressures their councillor colleagues are under. “They are very pissed off,” said one Minister, adding that councillors are “the last to find out”. This is often after officials in their local authority have been briefed, and they are left without answers to practical questions. A plan is coming, but this Minister confided: “It will take ages to put it together. How long is it going to take to build these places? How many of the modular units that were announced are built?” Ministers expect their local election candidates to put some water between themselves and the Government, with candidates looking for an angle to keep their seat. “We’re six months out from an election,” said one Minister. “We’re going to see a lot of this before June 7th.”",0,1
2024/1/22,"Norris makes impassioned plea for peace in Palestine in final speech to Seanad Veteran gay rights campaigner (79), retiring after 36 years in Leinster House, used last speaking opportunity to call for peace Long-time senator and gay rights campaigner David Norris has delivered an impassioned plea for peace in Palestine in his final speech the Seanad. Mr Norris is retiring after 36 years in Leinster House and he used his last opportunity to speak on the floor to advocate for peace. He told the Seanad: “What is happening to the inhabitants of Gaza is appalling and cannot be allowed to continue. “Man’s inhumanity to man is our greatest shame and I have to say also that it goes completely against the Jewish ethic which is L’Chaim – to life.” He criticised the Israeli government led by prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu saying it has instead of to life, it has committed to “to death in overwhelming numbers for the unfortunate, trapped citizens of Gaza. “I deplore it completely,” the 79-year-old added. He urged Seanad colleagues to “to continue to continue to push for peace in our times.” Mr Norris also used the speech to voice his support for Yes votes in the upcoming referendums on the family and care. The care referendum includes a proposal to delete the controversial “women in the home” language in the Constitution. Mr Norris said: “It is important that [the referendums] succeed. “Even though I will be retired, I will be to the best of my ability, campaigning for their success.” There was a standing ovation from other Senators who then began paying tribute to their departing colleague. Cathaoirleach of the Seanad Jerry Buttimer read out sections of letters of tribute to Mr Norris from President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. He said Mr Higgins predicted his legacy will be “as a champion of equality and diversity” who will continue to inspire future generations. He noted that the President also acknowledged Senator Norris’s “pride in our nation’s rich heritage that you fostered through your love, care and performance of and devoted passion for James Joyce”. Mr Buttimer added: “I know that the House will agree with the President’s aspiration and hope that you will have a well-deserved rest in the knowledge that your work has helped to make Ireland a better place for all.” He said that Mr Varadkar highlighted Senator Norris’s work on human rights, LGBT people, women and minorities saying that “in your campaigns you showed true leadership standing for causes that were unpopular and poorly understood but above all appealing to our best instincts as human beings: kindness, compassion, tolerance and acceptance”. He said that the Taoiseach noted how there are now three members of Cabinet who are openly gay. Independent Senator Michael McDowell spoke of the senator’s “immense courage” in taking on the Ireland’s anti-homosexuality law. “Courage was one of the hallmarks of David Norris’s contribution to Irish public life but it’s always been done with a sense of fun and a sense of irreverence and he doesn’t take himself all that seriously,” he said. Senator Norris, a one-time presidential candidate, is the current longest serving senator, a position known as Father of the House. He was the founder of the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform and was the first openly gay person elected to public office in Ireland. He is credited as being instrumental in the abolition of Ireland’s anti-homosexuality law following a campaign involving court cases that lasted for more than 14 years. The law was finally overturned in 1993. Senator Norris plans to split his time between Cyprus and Dublin during his retirement.",0,1
2024/1/23,"Cabinet to consider plans for rent-a-room scheme, pill and access to ATMs Stephen Donnelly proposing income from renting out room in your house to be disregarded in calculation of elegibility for medical card Income from the rent-a-room scheme will no longer be counted as relevant for people applying for a medical card, under plans being brought to Cabinet by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. The Cabinet meets on Tuesday morning to consider the plans as well as separate proposals which would allow women to secure the contraceptive pill from pharmacies. Minister for Finance Michael McGrath will also outline plans to ensure sufficient access to ATM services across the country. Under Mr Donnelly’s proposals, people will be able to rent out rooms in their home without this income being counted towards assessments for medical cards. The measures will come into force under the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2024, which provides for a disregard of such income of up to €14,000 a year from medical card assessment. It will mean that medical card holders or people who want to apply for a medical card could have income of up to €1,166 a month without it being counted during applications for medical cards. The Government is hoping that the new income disregard will help to remove barriers towards a wider utilisation of the rent-a-room scheme, and this could help more properties to become available to rent. Under other legislation being proposed by Mr Donnelly, women will be able to benefit from better access to contraception. This will remove the need for GP visits in some circumstances, by expanding the role of pharmacists in the State. Mr Donnelly plans to amend previous legislation from 1995 to enable pharmacists to sell and supply approved medicines without the need for a prescription, such as for minor ailments like conjunctivitis. This would also allow pharmacists to supply oral contraceptive pills without prescription. He is also due to bring plans to Cabinet to mitigate against the impact of medicines shortages. This would see pharmacists allowed supply a specified therapeutic alternative medicinal product in limited circumstances where a prescribed medicine is the subject of a shortage. Mr McGrath will also bring plans to Cabinet to ensure adequate access to cash around the country. He will tell Ministers that there are currently only three retail banks in Ireland where previously there were 12. His memo will state that cash usage has also declined. In the year prior to the pandemic, just under €20 billion was withdrawn from ATMs in the State, while the figure for 2022 was about €13.5 billion, a decline of just under a third. In terms of ATM transactions, the decline from pre-pandemic to 2022 is nearly 45 per cent, while the average value per withdrawal has increased to €154. Mr McGrath will say that while there are changes in the use of cash, it is still an important means of payment especially for older people and those on low incomes. Sources have said the legislation will ensure that access to cash is maintained initially at December 2022 levels, accounting for the exit of KBC and Ulster Bank by placing an obligation in this regard on retail banks. The new legislation will define what reasonable access to cash is – but the Minister will put in regulations what the criteria is for eight different geographical regions. The legislation will set the minimum numbers of ATMs per 100,000 people, and will outline the proportion within 10km of an ATM and a cash service point, whether banks or post offices. Responsibility for compliance will rest with the designated entities who will be the three main retail banks in the first instance. Is is understood that the Bill will also provide for the remedying of so called “local deficiencies” – locations within a region where particular difficulties arise in accessing cash. The Central Bank will assess such cases and, where warranted, could require the designated entities to address the issue. The legislation will also for the first time require ATM operators and cash-in-transit companies to be authorised and supervised by the Central Bank of Ireland.",0,1
2024/1/23,"Donnelly concerned over finding that Oliver Bond House residents have higher asthma rates Minister to outline plans at Cabinet allowing pharmacists to sell certain medicines without prescription Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has expressed concern after new research that found that residents of Oliver Bond House flats in Dublin are 2.4 times as likely to have asthma in their medical records as other patients attending the same general practice in their area. Welcoming the report by Trinity College Dublin’s school of medicine Mr Donnelly said: “I think it’s important to see if it fits with the clinical advice we have and the public health advice we have that the physical surroundings matter in terms of healthcare and in terms of underlying conditions.” He said the Government will be looking at the report and responding to it. Mr Donnelly added: “We have to make sure that wherever people are be they in private accommodation or in public housing it shouldn’t matter. “We have to make sure that the physical environment is conducive to them being healthy and we would be very concerned about a situation where we’re seeing these significantly higher rates of asthma and other underlying conditions.” He was speaking ahead of a Cabinet meeting where he will put forward a number proposals on housing and pharmacists. Income from the rent-a-room scheme will no longer be counted as relevant for people applying for a medical card or a GP card, under plans being brought to the meeting by Mr Donnelly. He said the move is “particularly timely as over half the population for the first time have access to free GP care and this will mean that anyone can take in up to €14,000 to rent-a-room” without losing access to a medical or GP card. Mr Donnelly said it is difficult to know how much rental accommodation the measure could add to the market but said: “Every single room that becomes available is very welcome.” He said a second measure he is proposing is to allow pharmacists to sell certain medicines – including the contraceptive pill – without prescription. Mr Donnelly said this would lift “some of the burden off GPs who are very, very busy.” He said a new framework would be brought in to allow pharmacists to dispense medicines without a prescription. This is to be “done in a very controlled way under regulation and under an expert advisory group.” Another plan being brought to Cabinet is to put the Medicines Shortage Protocol on a statutory footing. Mr Donnelly said this would mean that “whenever there is a shortage of [a medicine] that the pharmacist again, within guidelines and regulation can substitute that for their patient.”",0,1
2024/1/23,"Subvention for large energy users introduced after 2008 crash was renewed every year despite charging error - committee hears Senator Lynn Boylan (SF) questions why subvention was continued after financial crash had ended The controversial rebalancing subvention for 1,000 large energy users (LEUs) including multinational corporations introduced after the 2008 financial crash was renewed every year for 12 years after cursory reviews, the all-party Environment and Climate Action Committee was told. Representatives of Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) and ESB Networks outlined on Tuesday how during the second year of its operation, an adjustment was made to a financial model operated by the electricity distributor, which meant LEUs got a percentage share instead of a fixed amount. The subvention was designed to ease high electricity prices for big employers but penalised domestic consumers. The subvention agreed by government, put in place by CRU and applied by ESB Networks was meant to be limited to €50 million but ended up costing €101 million as “more than the amount approved in the CRU decision was passed to LEU customers” and to €300 in total extra charges was applied to 2 million domestic users. After hearing details of how the error was made, Deputy Paul Murphy of People Before Profit-Solidarity said the subvention was supposed to be a “shock doctoring” measure but was made permanent with expectation it would continue indefinitely. Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications Ossian Smyth defended the government decision but criticised lack of effective reviews of its operation. “[It] was made at a time when the then global financial crisis and domestic banking crisis were both starting to take effect and competitiveness of large Irish firms, together with the employment implications, were a serious policy issue. It was made to help safeguard jobs in some of Ireland’s most-critical and export-orientated industries, at a time when unemployment was rising at a fast rate.” LEUs then were mainly in the pharmaceutical and tech sectors, he said. “While today when people hear large energy user they may automatically jump to data centres, this was not the case back in 2009 ... These companies represented jobs in our communities at a time when they were few and far between.” “While the Government decision outlined that €50 million was to be rebalanced in favour of LEUs, it was for the regulator to determine how this would be implemented,” Mr Smyth said. This was “a request” to the CRU, an independent body, and not an instruction. ESB Networks managing director Nicholas Tarrant said tariffs are submitted to CRU each year for approval, but there was an error in the calculation process relating to the subvention made by ESB Networks, for which he apologised. Senator Lynn Boylan (SF) believed the CRU and the Department should also apologise. She questioned why the subvention was not audited regularly. “Why was it continued after the financial crisis had ended?” CRU commissioner Aoife MacEvilly said it was not stepping away from its responsibilities and had taken a decision every year to continue it. “The government took a policy decision, and we implemented it,” she added. CRU chairman Jim Gannon said the regulator had asked ESB Networks to review its governance on tariffs while CRU’s internal annual review mechanism has been enhanced. Before the recent energy crisis it had signalled it would review the LEU arrangements. “In preparation for this review, ESB Networks became aware, and notified the CRU, of an error in implementing the rebalancing arrangements.” He confirmed domestic and small business users would be refunded “immediately and in full” and increased charges for LEUs over three years would add up to a 25 per cent increase in their distribution charges. Fine Gael TD Richard Bruton said the tariff adjustment was “a bit strange” when it was clear a fixed amount was involved, but the subvention was understandable, given 200,000 people were unemployed.",0,1
2024/1/23,"TV licence to remain in place in 2024, Minister says Minister for Finance Michael McGrath says plans by Government to overhaul RTÉ funding will take time  Households will be expected to pay their TV licences in 2024 as Government plans to overhaul RTÉ funding will take time, Minister for Finance Michael McGrath has said. His comments come as the broadcaster is braced for two fresh reports  on governance at the station, including an examination of how the organisation came to lose €2.2 million on the Toy Show the Musical debacle, and a second report examining whether staff severance deals were managed correctly. The reports are expected imminently. Mr McGrath has again said he does not support a direct exchequer funding model for RTÉ, as it could result in the station being “at the mercy” of the government of the day for funding. He also ruled out suggestions that the TV licence fee could be collected in broadband bills. “We don’t have 100 per cent broadband coverage so I don’t think that would be a fair basis either. Until we have an acceptable replacement which is workable, with an implementation plan and a timeline, then the existing licence remains in place and the Government stands behind it, as it reminds people of the obligation to pay the licence fee. I am more than happy to engage in discussion on what the alternative will look like, but it will take time. “Even if the decision was made on an alternative, it will require legislation and the system will have to be set up; it will take time, so we will certainly have the TV licence for the remainder of this year,” Mr McGrath said. The Minister said he  believes  the Government should make a decision this year on what the future funding model will be for RTÉ. “I think we should make the decision this year and put the plans in place because it is important that RTÉ and others who provide public service broadcasting have a sustainable source of funding into the future. “I think for our democracy, for the year that we are in, when you look at what’s going on around the world, I think it has become more important that this fundamental pillar of democracy is protected and supported. One of the reasons why I am opposed to 100 per cent exchequer funding is that RTÉ and others who provide public service content would be entirely at the mercy of the government of the day.” Mr McGrath said he did not think this would represent “a healthy relationship”. “I also know from my experience that finding the money within the annual estimates process is very challenging, so even in the worst of times when RTÉ's reputation had been battered, I think around €130 million would have been collected in 2023 for the TV licence fee. “That is an awful lot of money to find in the annual estimates process when you’re competing with health and education and other areas that will also be looking for funding. I am not wedded to the existing TV licence being the instrument in future. I think alternatives can be looked at. But I do think that while it is there, it is important our Government stands behind it. It reminds people of the obligation to pay the TV licence fee, because that is the law of the land,” he said.",0,1
2024/1/23,"Banks and ATM providers to face ‘big sting’ penalties under new cash access plans Michael McGrath’s Bill aims to halt decline in number of ATMs with country divided into eight zones and minimum quotas of ATMs per 100,000 people to be specified Banks which do not comply with new rules to ensure access to cash and ATMs in communities around the country can expect a “pretty big sting” with potentially large financial penalties, Minister for Finance Michael McGrath has warned. Mr McGrath received Cabinet approval for the Access to Cash Bill which will ensure there is no further decline in the number of ATMs in towns and villages around the country. It will also see ATMs regulated for the first time. Under the legislation, the country is broken into eight geographical areas and Mr McGrath will set out the minimum number of ATMs per 100,000 people as well as the percentage of the population within no more than 10 km of a cash service point. The level of access to cash will be maintained initially at December 2022 levels. Banks or ATM providers which do not provide adequate access to cash could face a range of sanctions. Mr McGrath said this would represent “a pretty big sting” as providers would be labelled as designated entities under the Central Bank Act 1942. This would mean that the Central Bank could issue a caution or reprimand, or a direction to pay a monetary penalty. The proposals come amid a sharp decline in the amount of cash being withdrawn since the pandemic. Under Mr McGrath’s proposals, he will also have the power to cap access fees which are imposed by ATM operators in the State. An access fee is usually a flat-rate fee to use a specific ATM. They are generally not a feature in Ireland but Mr McGrath will reserve the power to cap them. This is separate to normal bank charges. There will also be measures to address local deficiencies which would mean one of the three main banks would have to install a new ATM. These could come about due to challenges with local infrastructure or from large-scale increases in population due to several large housing schemes coming on stream within a short period. “I do believe there is a genuine risk of financial exclusion if we allow the market to determine what is an appropriate level of access to cash. And I think, over time, we would see more and more ATMs being withdrawn from communities across the country. That is not something that we want to see happen,” Mr McGrath said, explaining the rationale behind the legislation. “Another area where we are making a change here relates to the actual regulation of the ATM operators and indeed cash-in-transit providers as well. For the first time, there will be regulations for independent ATM deployers and for all ATM operators that will cover issues such as service standards, hours of operation and withdrawal limits, denomination stocking, outages and maximum downtime period as well as communication requirements,” Mr McGrath said. Separately, Mr McGrath has also promised flexibilities to the tax debt warehousing scheme to help businesses struggling with finances post Covid-19. An estimated €1.7 billion is owed in Covid-era warehoused tax debt. “We are engaging with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to changes to the warehousing regime. It has been a very important part in helping to sustain businesses during Covid-19. We are looking now at the terms of the warehousing regime in the context of the May 1st deadline. That May 1st deadline is not that the tax that has to be repaid by then, it is that businesses must have entered into an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners… My guiding principle here is to be as flexible as we possibly can be to facilitate businesses that are experiencing cashflow problems,” the Minister said. “We will provide an extended period of time for businesses to repay that debt. And we will also provide in-built flexibility as there will be times when the business has to step out of the repayment arrangement.” Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone",0,1
2024/1/24,"Legislation to get rid of triple lock being drawn up ‘without delay’, Tánaiste tells Dáil Micheál Martin says legislation will have to be approved by Dáil and Seanad Legislation to get rid of  Ireland’s triple lock mechanism governing military deployment overseas is being drawn up “without delay”, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said. Mr Martin said such legislation will then be brought to Government and would have to be subsequently approved by the Dáil and Seanad. He also said there could “very well” be a mission to the Middle East if there was an effective peace plan in place there. Under the triple lock system, 12 or more Defence Forces troops cannot be deployed on an active overseas mission without approval from the Dáil, the Government and authorisation from the UN. Mr Martin, who is also the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, announced last November plans to scrap the triple lock. He said he wanted Ireland to be able to respond to crises without waiting for approval from the UN Security Council, which has not authorised a new peacekeeping mission since 2014. Sinn Féin TD Matt Carthy asked Mr Martin in the Dáil what was the time frame in which he intended to bring forward “regrettable proposals” to remove the triple lock, and which missions he envisaged the Defence Forces participating in from which they are currently precluded. In response, the Tánaiste said any modification to the triple lock will continue to require Government and Dáil approval for the dispatch of Defence Forces personnel to take part in peacekeeping and similar missions. Mr Martin added it would “do nothing to change Ireland’s traditional position of military neutrality”. The Fianna Fáil leader said there “clearly” needed to be a new process to replace the current system, which effectively allowed UN Security Council members to bind “Ireland’s hands in its international engagement”. “While not being prescriptive about what changes will be made, I have instructed officials in my department to prepare legislative proposals without delay that would govern the future overseas deployments of our Defence Forces,” he said. “Work on the preparation of those legislative proposals is progressing, with a view to bringing them to the Government in due course. “Any proposals agreed by the Government will then have to be presented to, and debated and approved, by the Dáil and the Seanad, thus providing the Oireachtas with ample opportunity to scrutinise any such proposals. It is important to emphasise that any legislative proposals will remain fully consistent with the principles of the UN charter and international law.” Mr Martin also said the Government had no plans for the Defence Forces to participate in any further overseas missions at present. “Indeed, and extremely regrettably, however, no new peacekeeping missions have been approved by the UN Security Council since 2014,” he said. “Given the volatility in international security today, we need in the future to be able to deploy our Defence Forces to peacekeeping and crisis response missions speedily and with agility, irrespective of whether they are led by the UN, the EU or another regional organisation.”",0,1
2024/1/24,"Drug use more ‘a public health issue’ than ‘criminal justice matter’, Taoiseach tells Dáil Leo Varadkar says Government will give ‘careful consideration’ to Citizens’ Assembly’s drug proposals The Government will give “careful consideration” to any kind of legal change in relation to proposals put forward by the Citizens’ Assembly on Drug Use, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar said he will meet the chair of the Assembly Paul Reid on Thursday, who will present its report, which will subsequently be published. Speaking during Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil on Wednesday, the Taoiseach said he believed that drug use and misuse by individuals should be seen primarily as “a public health issue and not a criminal justice matter”. “That is very different from drug dealing, for example, and the production of illegal medicines and drugs, and I certainly think that shaming people and blaming people and criminalising people isn’t an effective policy and has largely been rejected by the public, particularly younger people,” he said. Mr Varadkar was responding to People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny, who said the overall sentiment of the Citizens’ Assembly on Drug Use was that the “status quo” of criminalisation of drug use does not work. “This policy of criminalisation has been the State’s default position for the past six decades, that has stigmatised, marginalised and criminalised, not only individuals, but communities across the country,” Mr Kenny said. “But now we have a better understanding of addiction and the reasons why people fall into addictions. It’s a very complex issue, we have a more holistic kind of approach as to why that happens.” The Dublin Mid-West TD said there was “a generational chance” to change the current course. “Ireland has one of the highest overdose drug related deaths in Europe,” he added. “In the north of Ireland, there is an explosion of people dying in relation to drug related deaths. So something needs to happen.” Last October, the members of the Citizens’ Assembly on Drug Use voted to recommend ending the prosecution of those caught with illegal substances for personal use. Just 11 (17 per cent) of the 87 members voted in favour of retaining the current criminal approach to personal possession. Some 74 or 85 per cent of members believe it should not be retained as it stands. A majority of members of the Assembly voted for a comprehensive health-led approach to the policy on illegal drug use. Mr Varadkar also said while he had previously been “a sceptic of Citizens’ Assemblies”, he had become a fan of them over the past five to 10 years. “We don’t always accept the recommendations nor do we have to, but we always consider them,” he said. The Fine Gael leader also said he had spoken with gardaí who said they would rarely prosecute people for possession of drugs and when they do, it’s because they suspect they may have been dealing.",0,1
2024/1/24,"Who is the Irishman elected Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner? Former head of Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission vows to defend rights of minorities in senior Strasbourg post Irish human rights lawyer and former priest Michael O’Flaherty was elected human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe on Wednesday, vowing to defend human rights law and institutions and stand up for the people of Ukraine. The role is the most senior non-judicial post ever held by an Irish person in the Council of Europe, the Strasbourg body of 46 member states that was founded in the wake of World War Two to prevent abuses, including through the European Court of Human Rights. The role of the human rights commissioner, a six-year non-renewable term that was instituted in 1999, involves being an international advocate for human rights who coordinates with national authorities and civil society, reporting and advising on how protections are upheld. “The role of the commissioner is particularly important today, at a moment when we don’t just have human rights abuses, but we have a rejection of the system,” O’Flaherty told the Irish Times. “If we reject the human rights system, we reject the only universally agreed roadmap to honor human dignity and that will be a disaster,” he continued. “So much of what we take for granted in terms of our freedoms and our rights in our societies, is because of the Council of Europe.” O’Flaherty (64) is the outgoing Director of the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency and previously spent 18 years in the United Nations in various roles, including setting up human rights operations in Bosnia-Herzogovina, Sierra Leone, and in the Asia Pacific. Originally from Galway, O’Flaherty was chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission from 2011 to 2013, and worked as a professor at the University of Nottingham and the University of Galway. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1987, but left the priesthood to take up human rights work in the 1990s. He was nominated by the Irish government to succeed the outgoing commissioner, Bosnian human rights expert Dunja Mijatović, and was formally recommended in a letter by Tánaiste Micheál Martin as someone with “extremely strong credentials” for the role. The Irish candidate won with 104 votes out of 211 in a vote of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly on Wednesday night, defeating rival candidates Meglena Kuneva of Bulgaria and Manfred Nowak of Austria. He will take up the post on April 1st. O’Flaherty said his experience in the North was essential preparation for the post, as he witnessed “the role of human rights in building bridges and establishing trust across divided communities”, and that it was significant for an Irish figure to hold the position. “Coming from Ireland means that the commissioner comes from a small country that doesn’t have a history of colonial domination. A country that has known enormous challenges throughout history, including starvation,” he after the result was announced. “We have the experience of the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement and the peace process which carries enormously relevant lessons for many other societies that are facing conflict.” He ran for the post on a platform of defending the human rights of people in Ukraine as they suffer a Russian invasion, upholding human rights law and institutions, and standing up for minorities. “In the first place, we have to stand up for the people of Ukraine, their human rights,” O’Flaherty said. “Then we have to then we have to tackle all the other problems: the shocking levels of hate in our societies, the rise in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, the inequalities between people, the backsliding on democracy and rule of law.”",0,1
2024/1/25,"Cocaine seizures a ‘headline’ trend for Revenue with workload having ‘exploded’ since Brexit Committee told agency seeking to educate social media influencers about tax obligations with many involved young people having no real understanding  Revenue’s customs work has “exploded” since Brexit and efforts to thwart cocaine smuggling into Ireland was the “headline” trend last year when it came to enforcement operations, the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has heard. Revenue processed some 79 million legitimate import entries last year, up from around one million per year before Brexit. The tax collection agency’s chairman, Niall Cody, said there is also contraband hidden within imports like counterfeit goods, drugs and cigarettes. Fine Gael TD Alan Dillon asked him about trends in customs and excise enforcement and whether any specific violations were becoming more prevalent. Mr Cody said last year was “kind of an exceptional” one, adding that “I suppose the headline was probably cocaine”. There was a record cocaine haul last September when the MV Matthew was seized off the south coast during an operation that saw Irish Army Rangers board the vessel from a helicopter. Some 2,253kg of cocaine was found on board worth €157 million – the largest seizure by weight in Irish history. Revenue was involved in the operation and Mr Cody called it “a really good example of inter-agency cooperation”. He said there as another big seizure at Foynes Port just before Christmas, with around €21 million worth of cocaine was found on that occasion. Mr Cody also highlighted that there had been “a very significant level” of drug seizures at Rosslare Port. He said the port used to have six ferries during the week in winter and 10 every week in the summer, but now there are 36 ferries coming and going weekly. The increase has occurred since Brexit with more services operating as hauliers seek alternatives to the UK land-bridge. “On one level our customs work has just exploded,” Mr Cody said, adding that Revenue’s staff levels at Rosslare alone have gone from 18 people to 80. The committee was told there was a successful recruitment drive in 2019 to prepare for the changes in customs arrangements that would occur as a result of the UK leaving the European Union. Mr Cody said Brexit has been “a big challenge” in terms of IT systems needed to deal with the related changes and “the significant increase in customs receipts as a result of our closest trading partner leaving the [European Union] Single Market”. Separately, the committee was told that Revenue is seeking to educate social media influencers on their tax obligations. Fianna Fáil TD Paul McAuliffe asked about Revenue letters issued to influencers and how their fees or gifts, such as hotel stays, are treated for tax purposes. Mr Cody said it is a new industry “but tax rules apply to them just like they apply to anybody else” and that influencers’ income - monetary or in-kind - comes under the self-assessment system. He said Revenue has gotten third party information from entities paying influencers and has written to the individuals involved. There have been some “level one interventions” which is essentially a reminder that a person may have a tax issue, he said. “I have seen some of the cases. Some of the people are actually very young and have probably no real understanding… so what we’re trying to do is educate people to get them into the system,” he added.",0,1
2024/1/28,"DUP executive to discuss potential deal on ending boycott of powersharing in North Executive members invited to briefing at ‘secure venue’ where party leader Jeffrey Donaldson will provide ‘update on the current political situation’ A meeting of the influential Democratic Unionist Party executive will take place on Monday amid calls by Sinn Féin for the party to end its “will they, won’t they” return to Stormont. In what is expected to be a critical week for Northern Ireland politics, the 130-strong executive members will gather at a secret location to discuss a potential deal with the UK government amid speculation the party is preparing to end its two-year boycott of the powersharing institutions. The DUP executive is the party’s ultimate ruling body. It is unclear if an executive vote on the deal and possible return to devolved government will take place on Monday night. In advance of the meeting, one insider told The Irish Times: “I do think the party is at the endgame of this; we’re at the point now of the party going back in within a short period of time or looking for a new leader.” Details of the gathering were leaked on social media on Friday evening. Executive members received emails inviting them to a briefing at a “secure venue” where party leader Jeffrey Donaldson would provide a “detailed update on the current political situation”. Information about the location will be given to them on Monday. A senior Sinn Féin TD said the time had come for the DUP to make a decision. “We’ve been here so many times, there’s been so many false dawns when it comes to the DUP, and the DUP really need to end this blockade of this Assembly and accept the fact that people in the Assembly election [in May 2022] voted for change and the dynamics are changing and have changed in the North,” Pearse Doherty told RTÉ on Sunday. “We have to get off this endless merry-go-round in relation to ‘will they, won’t they?’ “They should absolutely jump but the British government needs to stop facilitating them, they’ve told us that the negotiations are over. And they need to get back into the Assembly. There’s nothing more to talk about,” he said. The development comes in advance of next weekend’s two-year anniversary of the DUP collapsing Stormont when the party’s former first minister, Paul Givan, quit the powersharing executive in protest at post-Brexit trading arrangements. It also takes place before further strike action by bus and train drivers this Thursday. The latest action by Translink workers comes after a mass walkout by public sector workers earlier this month in a dispute over pay. Pre-Christmas talks aimed at restoring Stormont ended in failure after the DUP insisted that separate negotiations with the UK government on the Windsor Framework post-Brexit deal were ongoing despite northern secretary Chris Heaton-Harris saying they had “effectively concluded”. A £3.3 billion (€3.9 billion) funding package by London – of which almost £600 million would resolve the public sector pay row – remains on offer but is dependent on the executive’s return. Hardline unionist opposition to the DUP’s possible return to the Assembly chambers without the removal of the post-Brexit “Irish Sea border” ratcheted up over the weekend, with Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister urging those DUP members against the move to revolt against the party leadership. A paper co-authored by Mr Allister, former UK Labour minister Kate Hoey, former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib and loyalist activist Jamie Bryson titled “No Deal is Better than a Bad Deal” will be published in advance of Monday’s crunch executive meeting. “The perversion and constitutional obscenity of a partitioning border in the Irish Sea would be given permanency through its acceptance by the DUP, if they return to Stormont now,” the authors write. “We encourage unionism to stand firm and refuse to be either bought or bullied.”",0,1
2024/1/29,"Ireland will urge countries to restore funding to UN Palestinian refugee agency, says Martin Tánaiste says UNWRA has been ‘key humanitarian intervention’ to help Palestinians and withdrawing support ‘would be catastrophic’ Ireland will be urging countries which have suspended funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees to restore the support, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said. Mr Martin, who is also the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said he will be advocating for support to be restored to UNRWA, the UN relief and works agency, “with whomever I meet”. Several countries have suspended financing of the UNRWA after Israel accused a dozen employees of involvement in Hamas’s October 7th attack which saw 1,200 people killed and 253 abducted. The United States, UK, Finland, Italy, Australia and Canada have all suspended their funding for UNRWA while an investigation into the allegations takes place. The head of the agency, Philippe Lazzarini, vowed to hold “accountable, including through criminal prosecution” any UNRWA employee found to have been involved in “acts of terror”. Ireland and Norway are continuing to fund UNRWA – which provides services like schooling and healthcare as well as aid – amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Martin said UNWRA has been the “key humanitarian intervention” to help the Palestinians and withdrawing support now “would be catastrophic in the context of a terrible war”. Mr Martin said he understands the concerns about the alleged involvement of some UNRWA staff in the October 7th attacks and he believes Mr Lazzarini will deal with the matter. He added: “In my view given the size of the organisation – 30,000 people altogether in UNRWA, 13,000 working in Gaza – there has to be a sense of perspective in terms of what’s been alleged and the numbers involved.” Asked if he will be calling on the United States, the UK and others to restore funding to UNRWA he said: “I will be advocating with whomever I meet, yes, for the restoration of support to UNRWA.” On whether the issue funding of UNRWA will come up during Irish ministers’ St Patrick’s Day missions abroad, Mr Martin said: “I would hope it will be restored before then.” Separately, Sinn Féin has tabled a Dáil motion calling for Ireland to join South Africa in its genocide case against Israel. Mr Martin said he will discuss Ireland’s approach to the case with Opposition parties here saying the issue is “complex” and “They need to be apprised I think of what actually is involved here.” On Friday the International Court of Justice found that South Africa’s accusation that Israel has breached the genocide convention was plausible enough for it to order emergency measures to protect Palestinian lives. It also ordered armed groups in Gaza to release all hostages seized in the Hamas-led attack on Israel of October 7th that precipitated the Gaza war, and for Israel to allow sufficient humanitarian aid to reach the coastal strip. The full case as to whether Israel has breached the genocide convention will be heard at a later date. Mr Martin said there is a “strong unified position” in Ireland in the call for a humanitarian ceasefire. He said: “likewise, we want to hold Israel to account and Hamas to account for the conduct of the war in Gaza, and also in terms of the Hamas attack on October the 7th.” Mr Martin said he has had a preliminary briefing on the case from Department of Foreign Affairs legal advisers adding: “This is complex. It’s not at all simple.” He also said Irish officials in The Hague – where the case is being heard – have met South African government representatives. Mr Martin said South Africa hasn’t “filed any substantive case yet and the indications are that it will be some months before they do that. “The fundamental point with intervention [by Ireland] is the basis upon which one intervenes in a case of this magnitude and gravity. “So there’s a lot of work to be done yet.” The war in Gaza has killed more than 26,000 people since an Israeli bombardment and invasion was launched in response to the October 7th terror attack.",0,1
2024/1/29,"Jeffrey Donaldson briefs DUP executive on possible deal to end two-year powersharing boycott A small group of protesters holding banners emblazoned with ‘Stop DUP sell-out’ gathered outside Larchfield Estate The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) executive was being briefed by party leader Jeffrey Donaldson on Monday night on a potential deal with the UK government that could lead to Stormont’s restoration. More than 120 executive members met at Larchfield Estate near Lisburn, Co Down, following a day of intense speculation that the ground was being prepared to end the party’s two-year boycott of the powersharing institutions over post-Brexit trading arrangements. A small group of protesters holding banners emblazoned with “Stop DUP sell-out” gathered outside the venue and told arriving members to “do the right thing” and continue their boycott until the so-called “Irish Sea Border” is scrapped. Details of the location were not disclosed until Monday afternoon. Information about the planned meeting had last Friday been leaked on social media. Prior to his arrival, Mr Donaldson met his team of MPs and peers at DUP headquarters in east Belfast to discuss the outcome of protracted negotiations with the UK government over the post-Brexit Windsor Framework agreement. East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson and North Antrim MP Ian Paisley were among those to attend the two-hour briefing but made no comment to waiting media. Loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson live tweeted what he claimed was a “blow by blow account” of Monday night’s meeting. Mr Bryson gave a running commentary of the meeting, and in one of his posts said that it  descended into “mayhem” after Mr Donaldson told more than 120 members gathered that he was aware of the leaks. “Meeting now halted. Anger that meeting is being live tweeted,” he claimed. He added: “DUP meeting descends into mayhem. JD [Mr Donaldson] saying texts being sent to Jamie Bryson who is giving a blow by blow account to the meeting”. In another post, Mr Bryson claimed the meeting had been told that police were trying to “block phone signals” in the venue. In a statement, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said it “has no involvement in this”. The development comes just days after Mr Bryson  – one of the most vocal opponents of Stormont being restored until the so-called “Irish Sea Border” is scrapped – leaked details of an internal DUP email invite to Monday evening’s executive meeting. As a result, the DUP executive members were only informed on Monday afternoon about its location in what was supposed to be a “secure venue”. Meanwhile, DUP leader Mr Donaldson held a separate meeting with his Assembly team earlier in the day. However, there was no briefing with his 12 party officers, a powerful decision-making group that has the power to sign off on a deal before it is brought before the executive. Mr Donaldson was on Monday night expected to signal his support for a possible deal that would restore devolution and use the opportunity to get final concessions from London in coming days. In advance of the meeting, one insider told The Irish Times: “I do think the party is at the endgame of this; we’re at the point now of the party going back in within a short period of time or looking for a new leader.” A report in the Daily Telegraph last week suggested that British prime minister Rishi Sunak has sought to placate the DUP with an undertaking to introduce a requirement that all new laws are screened to ensure they will not create extra trade barriers in the Irish Sea. Earlier, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said he wanted to give the DUP “space” ahead of its meeting. Speaking at a Brexit-related press conference at Iveagh House, he reiterated the Irish Government’s position that it would like to see a restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly but added “less is more today” in terms of commenting as the DUP was meeting. He said it is a matter for the DUP “to take whatever decisions it feels fit”. However, Mr Martin said his own view was the restoration of the Executive and the Assembly “is in the best interests of Northern Ireland”. “What has been agreed over time now puts Northern Ireland in a very strong position to grow economically” The Tánaiste was speaking ahead of a meeting of the Brexit Stakeholder Forum in the Republic where he reiterated the Irish Government’s message to all Irish exporters to get ready for the new UK import controls starting on January 31st.",0,1
2024/1/30,"Varadkar and Sunak clash over UK Troubles law On Tuesday night, a spokesman for the Taoiseach played down the reports of the difficult aspects of the call British prime minister Rishi Sunak strongly criticised Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for Ireland’s case against the UK’s legacy act during a telephone call between the two men on Tuesday to discuss the breakthrough at Stormont. Mr Varadkar announced before Christmas that the Irish Government would take legal action in the European Court of Human Rights against the UK over the legislation, which allows immunity to be offered to the perpetrators of Troubles-era crimes In a call on Tuesday, Mr Sunak criticised the decision, and expressed the British government’s “disappointment” that Dublin would take the case at such a sensitive time in Northern Ireland. In a statement, Government Buildings in Dublin said the call with Mr Sunak had been “a good call” to discuss the political breakthrough in the North – which could see the return of Stormont by the weekend – and that the two men “agreed to keep in touch over the coming period”. But in a briefing to political correspondents, Downing Street confirmed that parts of the call had been much less harmonious. “The prime minister expressed his disappointment at the timing and course of action in December, coming at such a sensitive time,” a spokesperson said. “He noted that the Irish Government had yet to respond to important questions about its own approach to legacy issues, including with regard to investigations into the 1998 Omagh bombing. The UK government would continue to pursue answers to those questions which had been laid out by the Secretary of State, including with regard to the lack of criminal prosecutions in Ireland.” It was put to Number 10 by reporters at the briefing that the call between the two leaders sounded “testy”, and the readout was unusually blunt in diplomatic terms, although Mr Sunak’s spokeswoman played down these suggestions. She said it was a “good call” with the Taoiseach. However, she reiterated the UK government’s sense of “disappointment” with the Republic for taking the case. On Tuesday night, a spokesman for the Taoiseach played down the reports of the difficult aspects of the call. “It was a positive call focused on welcoming the good news from Belfast. It’s common knowledge that the two governments have different approaches on legacy issues. But we also agreed that it’s important that we continue to work together on other areas.” Regarding political developments in Northern Ireland, the text of the legislation which secured the DUP’s return to powersharing is to be published by the UK on Wednesday. The publication of the proposals is the next step in the process which will see the Assembly recalled and a Speaker nominated, ending the two-year limbo caused by the DUP’s boycott. Ministries and Assembly seats will be allocated according to the result of the 2022 Assembly election, and the Sinn Féin vice-president, Michelle O’Neill, will take up her position as first minister – the first time in the history of Northern Ireland a nationalist has held the role. The breakthrough was announced at a press conference on Tuesday morning following a five-hour meeting of the DUP’s executive, when the party leader Jeffrey Donaldson announced that “subject to binding commitments” being “fully and faithfully delivered as agreed” the package of measures provided a basis for the party’s return to Stormont. The Northern Secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, confirmed the UK government “will stick to this agreement” and said he now believed “all the conditions are in place for the Assembly to return.” The imminent restoration of powersharing was welcomed by the other main parties in the North and by trade unions, which repeated their call for the Northern Secretary to release the money to settle the public sector pay dispute and said strike action would continue until it is resolved. The full text of the deal is expected on Wednesday afternoon when Mr Heaton-Harris is due to lay a Command Paper before the House of Commons. He declined to be drawn on the detail on Tuesday, telling reporters the changes were “significant” and had not affected divergence from EU rules “in any shape or form.” In an interview on the BBC’s Good Morning Ulster, Mr Donaldson said it got rid of the border in the Irish Sea, saying there would be “zero checks, zero customs paperwork on goods moving within the United Kingdom”. His party colleague Edwin Poots said the legislation would require European agreement, saying “there’ll be no Assembly until that happens…. which indicates that it is significant changes, it’s not tinkering about the margins.”",0,1
2024/1/31,"DUP deal to provide ‘real change’ for North, says Donaldson, as restoration of powersharing looms EU to ‘analyse carefully’ agreement that pledges ‘unfettered access’ to Britain while removing most post-Brexit checks on goods Legislation by the UK government to break the impasse at Stormont will see the removal of almost all checks on goods between Northern Ireland and Britain. The UK government’s 88-page command paper, titled Safeguarding the Union, published on Wednesday envisaged “unfettered access” between Northern Ireland and the UK. The UK government intends to amend the UK’s Internal Market Act to prohibit exit checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Britain. This will replace the green and red lanes from the Northern Ireland protocol which unionists believed separated them from the rest of the United Kingdom. The publication of the proposed legislation by the British government has been widely welcomed in the UK, Ireland and the United States. The paper is likely to pave the way for the restoration of Stormont for the first time in two years as early as Saturday. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Jeffery Donaldson said he was proud that his party had secured changes which he believed met its seven tests for a return to Stormont. He added: “This is our achievement, after two years of hard work and negotiation.” He said it would provide “real change delivering progress for everyone in Northern Ireland” amid “long and protracted negotiations”. He spoke of a “a confident unionism, a forward-looking unionism ... that wants to make progress for everyone in Northern Ireland”. Mr Donaldson said he has not seen the figures, but he was sure the overwhelming majority of party delegates voted in favour of the deal on Monday night. However, Sammy Wilson, one of the DUP’s most senior MPs, criticised the British government as “spineless and Brexit-betraying” in “refusing to take on the EU and its interference in Northern Ireland”. The Northern Ireland Assembly’s role in having an “emergency brake” on any EU legislation has been expanded. EU law will no longer automatically apply in Northern Ireland. Before the deal, it would have taken at least half of the Assembly members to object before EU law could be scrutinised. The DUP and British government say the legislation will underpin Northern Ireland’s place within the UK. Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Chris Heaton-Harris said the deal “taken as a whole, is the right one for Northern Ireland and for the union”. “With this package it is now time for elected representatives in Northern Ireland to come together, to end the two years of impasse and start work again in the interests of the people that elected them.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said there would be “questions” about the deal and its effect on trading arrangements but that as things stood there were no major “red flags”. “We’ve only really seen the detail today, we’re going to have to study it. I think there are certainly going to be some questions we will want to ask, more particularly the European Commission will want to ask some questions about the trading arrangements,” Mr Varadkar told reporters. The deal would need to be faithful both to the Good Friday Agreement in ensuring no hard border between North and South, and also respect the Windsor Framework that was agreed between the EU and UK government, he said. Tánaiste Micheál Martin said advocacy from unionism has “paid dividends” in changing post-Brexit trade arrangements for the North. It is now a moment “we need to grasp” for the benefit of people in the region and across the entire island, he added. He said: “In many ways, the Windsor Framework was a significant advance on the protocol and what had been there from a unionist perspective, and I would say that advocacy from unionism paid dividends in respect of the Windsor Framework, and indeed, on other issues as well in respect of the trading arrangements.” In Brussels, the European Commission said it will “analyse carefully” the agreement to tweak Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit arrangements. The Commission’s vice-president, and lead man on deal making with Britain, Maroš Šefčovič held a phone call with foreign secretary David Cameron and Mr Heaton-Harris. In a joint statement after the call, they said both sides agreed “on the high importance of seeing the Northern Ireland Executive restored and delivering for the people of Northern Ireland”. Both sides have a “shared commitment to the full implementation of the Windsor Framework”, it said, and would continue talks together through the channels that the agreement set up. The two sides proposed a solution on tariff rate quotas earlier this week. The EU has previously said that Britain is free to tweak how it implements the Windsor Framework internally. In London, the deal was broadly welcomed across the political divide with no sign of any major opposition emerging to it. Labour confirmed in the House of Commons that it would vote for those elements of the plan that are due up for parliamentary approval on Thursday. Soon after the details began to emerge early in the afternoon on Wednesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson said that the agreement must not prevent Britain from having the ability to diverge from EU standards. He said Britain must “at all costs avoid a return to the disastrous Chequers model” of alignment on standards that his predecessor, Theresa May, tried and failed to implement. The European Research Group of Brexit hardliners held a low-key meeting in Westminster on Wednesday night. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a one-time Brexit “ultra”, told reporters outside the meeting that he believed the UK government had “done well” with the deal. The Scottish National Party welcomed the deal, as did Labour’s leader Keir Starmer. Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for prime minister Rishi Sunak said the deal made “changes to the operation of the Windsor Framework but not to its fundamentals”. The outgoing Stormont speaker Alex Maskey has contacted all Stormont MLAs telling them that they need to be ready to elect his successor and appoint ministers in the days ahead. In his letter to them, he stated that the last time the Assembly was convened in January 2020, it was convened with just 24 hours notice. “A similar time frame may be necessary on this occasion,” he said.",0,1
2024/1/4,"Pay talks ‘crucial’ to avoid strike ballots, says union chief Unions have said that if there is no agreement, they will meet next Thursday to begin the process of balloting on industrial action over pay Talks between Government and unions next week will be crucial if a round of strike ballots in public sector trade unions are to be avoided, a senior union leader has said. Talks between officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and union leaders on a new public sector pay deal adjourned without agreement before Christmas and are due to reconvene next week. But unions have said that if there is no agreement, they will meet next Thursday to begin the process of balloting on industrial action over pay. Kevin Callinan, the general secretary of the Fórsa union and former President of Ictu, said that ballots on a possible wave of public sector strikes are likely to go ahead unless there is agreement in the first half of next week. “I don’t see our meeting on Thursday being deferred,” he said. “If there’s no agreement, the ballots will go ahead.” Talks with Government representatives on Monday and Tuesday, he said, will be “really crucial”. But there has been little sign in recent weeks that an agreement on pay for 2024 – and perhaps subsequent years – is likely. After several weeks of negotiations, the talks were paused before Christmas, and while some progress on issues was reported, sources say that the two sides have not yet discussed the central issue of a pay increase for the State’s 385,000 employees. The existing pay deal expired at the end of 2023, leading the trade unions to announce they would ballot for industrial action next week if no deal was agreed. Before Christmas, the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said that the State side would make a pay offer once all other issues had been resolved. Union sources have complained that the Government has shown little urgency to conclude a deal. The prospect of public sector strikes would cause significant unease in Government, particularly with elections on the horizon. Sinn Féin called on the Government to “dedicate itself to negotiating a public-sector pay agreement as a matter of urgency”. The party’s spokeswoman on enterprise and employment Louise O’Reilly said the Government has “refused to conclude a deal before the Building Momentum agreement expired. “Resultantly, public sector workers have been outside of a pay agreement since January 1st. “This is a total failure of the Government, and this is incredibly destabilising for industrial relations,” she said.",0,1
2024/1/4,"Covid-19: Inquiry into Ireland’s handling of pandemic to hear from bereaved families Coalition wants to appoint independent chair who did not have role in managing crisis A new inquiry into the State’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to hear from frontline health workers and families who lost loved ones, but there may not be an entitlement to privilege if allegations against named individuals are made. The shape of the examination into the State’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic is now emerging, with the inquiry due to be set up in the next 12 weeks. It will likely take up to 18 months to complete its work. Senior officials are now finalising the terms of reference for the process. While the exact  way in which the inquiry will take place has not yet been finalised, officials are understood to have examined the pros and cons  of mechanisms such as a commission of investigation, a tribunal mechanism or a scoping inquiry. A senior source confirmed that while there will be a public aspect to the inquiry, where written or verbal submissions can be made, the intention is that individuals will not be able to make allegations and be automatically entitled to legal protection or privilege. The plans are due to be considered by Ministers at one of the first Cabinet meetings of the new political year, it is understood. The Department of Taoiseach has been leading the work for setting up the parameters of the inquiry. It is expected to comprise a panel and chair, although the Coalition could face difficulty in appointing members. This is because the Government wants to appoint members who are independent and who did not have a role in either managing the pandemic and who did not disclose publicly their opinion of the handling of Covid-19. Sources have also confirmed that the terms of reference will be broad and that the scope of the investigation could result in a lengthy process. It is hoped that it will be set up in the first three months of 2024 and will last between 12 and 18 months, although any delay in appointing inquiry members could potentially lead to further slippage. The inquiry will look at the public health response as well as the economic, social and educational aspects. It will consider the response and situation inside hospitals, in the community, and in nursing homes. “This will be about what happened, what was done well, and what could have been done better. It is not about blaming or exonerating anyone,” a source said. In the coming weeks, the Government intends to consult Opposition party leaders once the terms of reference are finalised. Sinn Féin health spokesman David Cullinane said his party wants the forthcoming inquiry “to fully examine the State’s preparedness and response to the pandemic”. “This has to include healthcare capacity, including ICU capacity and the response to Covid in nursing homes and in hospitals. The families of those who lost loved ones in healthcare and nursing home settings should be consulted through representative groups. Any inquiry must be about establishing the facts as to the State and the Government’s response to Covid. There must also be recognition of the heroic efforts of frontline and essential workers across all services and the economy.” Senior officials are understood to have considered the structure of Covid-19 inquiries in other countries as part of their scoping work. In Sweden, a government-appointed commission was set up and was made up of a panel of eight experts. The final report found that Sweden – which chose not to follow many other countries into ordering lockdowns – should have shut venues and taken other tougher measures earlier, although its no-lockdown strategy was found to be broadly beneficial. In Italy, one of the worst-hit EU countries at the earliest stage of the pandemic, a parliamentary inquiry was ordered last summer. In the UK, a public Covid-19 inquiry is under way and is not expected to conclude its work until 2026 or potentially later.",0,1
2024/1/4,"Shape of Covid-19 inquiry begins to emerge – but will it satisfy Opposition and public? Ministers want the inquiry to focus on learning lessons rather than finger-pointing. The public will likely expect it to shy away from neither Nearly four years ago, Covid-19 swept through the globe and became the only story on the political agenda. In Ireland, the Government assumed extraordinary powers that curtailed citizens’ freedom, shuttering the country with lockdowns that proved lengthy, costly and divisive. Ireland would go on to spend a €17.1 billion on the response to Covid-19 during the first 12 months alone, propping up businesses and employees and pumping money into a health service stretched beyond breaking point. After a number of different waves of the virus, and as the country wearied of onerous restrictions, it became inevitable that an inquiry would have to be held not only to examine how the political and public health decisions were made, but whether they were the right ones. After being promised for years, the shape of the long-awaited inquiry into the State’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic is finally starting to emerge. The inquiry will likely be composed of a panel of experts, led by a chair. Finding the right inquiry members will not be easy – ideally they will be leaders in their field who are also independent, and they must be knowledgeable about the Irish context without having ever cast any aspersions or opinions on the general response to the pandemic. For example, what would become of a panel candidate who was found to have commented on the sometimes rocky relationship between Leo Varadkar and former chief medical officer Tony Holohan, or the power dynamic between the National Public Health Emergency Team and Government? Would choosing a chair from outside of Ireland get around this? Inquiry members will also be expected to be in place for up to 18 months – and in reality probably longer – a  significant commitment and a  heavy workload. The exact mechanism through which the inquiry takes place has not yet been  finalised but senior officials have examined the pros and cons of a commission structure, a tribunal structure, or a scoping inquiry. There will likely be some scoping element before the main body of work. It is clear the Government wants it to be a non-adversarial process – Varadkar previously said it would be a search for truth and not a “witch-hunt”. That may be the case, but the process itself will stand or fall on whether citizens and the political system believe it has been an honest, sober, independent and transparent process that delivers a verdict that could ultimately make uncomfortable reading at times for the three governing parties. In the coming weeks Opposition leaders will be briefed on the terms of reference for the inquiry. They will want to know the legal underpinning to the inquiry, and whether senior figures who were at the fore of the pandemic response will be  entitled to lawyer up. We know now that there will be a public element to the inquiry where a person can make a verbal or written statement, but how much of the overall inquiry will be held in public? Frontline workers who bore the brunt of the toughest days will also want to know that they will have their voices heard, as will families who lost members in nursing homes, hospitals and the community. There will be questions too around the cost of this process, whether legal or otherwise. Ministers want the inquiry to be focused on learning lessons to enhance the response to future pandemics, rather than a finger-pointing exercise. The public will likely expect any inquiry to shy away from neither.",0,1
2024/1/4,"About 60,000 students in line for increased grants starting from this week Some college students will get up to €342 in extra funding between now and May, says Simon Harris  About 60,000 third-level students are in line for increased grants as changes to the sums on offer kick in from this week. Some college students will get up to €342 in extra funding between now and May, according to Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris. He also highlighted how maintenance grants for post-graduate students are to return for the first time in 13 years. He also said there is a need to look at how cost-of-living measures brought in by the Government for third-level students could be “potentially be made more permanent reductions as we go forward”. However, he added: “There’s a long way to go before the next budget.” Mr Harris said he is “very aware that the cost of college is significant for many families across Ireland”, adding that this is why college fees were reduced by at least €1,000 for about 100,000 people in the last budget. Mr Harris said that people in receipt of student grants will start to see an increase. “For some that can mean a total of €342 between now and May and a total increase of €615 in their grant rate for the year. “For others, it will see the return of post-graduate maintenance grants at all levels for the first time since the economic crash.” He said this will “put €2,384 into the pocket of those postgrads who will become eligible for the highest rate of increase between now and May”. Mr Harris also announced a once-off increase to the Student Assistance Fund of €1,476,541, bringing the total investment to more than €19 million. This fund is designed to support students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds with ongoing needs for financial support and provide emergency financial assistance for other students. Mr Harris also encouraged parents who pay for rental accommodation for their college-going children to avail of the €750 renter’s tax credit.",0,1
2024/1/6,"Michael Lowry says costs dispute with Moriarty tribunal settled more than decade after final report Tipperary TD, who was criticised in tribunal report, said his representation costs amounted to €2.8 million The Independent TD for Tipperary, Michael Lowry, has said his long-running dispute over costs with the Moriarty tribunal has finally been resolved. In a short statement on Saturday, Mr Lowry said a dispute over costs amounting to €2,869,338 “arising from representation on my behalf” before the tribunal has been resolved. In 2018 the Court of Appeal granted Mr Lowry’s appeal against the decision in 2013 of the tribunal to award him only one-third of his costs. The court sent the decision as to what costs should be paid to Mr Lowry back to the tribunal for reconsideration. The tribunal had originally decided to only pay the politician one-third of his costs because of findings of non-co-operation it made against him. The High Court had dismissed the former Fine Gael minister’s challenge to the costs decision which he then brought to the Court of Appeal. Mr Lowry has now said the matter has been resolved and that he will not be commenting further. “Although the delay in finalising this issue was inexcusable, unreasonable, and unfair, I am pleased with the final resolution and the discharge of the costs to those who represented me before the Tribunal,” he said. The payments to politicians tribunal was established in 1997 and issued its final report in March 2011. Among its many findings were that Mr Lowry, as Minister for Communications, had interfered in the awarding of the State’s second mobile phone licence to Denis O’Brien’s Esat Digifone, and that there had been payments by Mr O’Brien to Mr Lowry that were “demonstrably referable” to Mr Lowry’s conduct in respect to the licence award. Mr O’Brien and Mr Lowry said they did not agree with the tribunal’s findings. Among the tribunal’s other findings were that Mr Lowry and his accountant, Denis O’Connor, had been involved in a “choreographed falsehood” that was “orchestrated by O’Connor and Lowry with the objective of misleading the tribunal” in relation to one module of the tribunal’s inquiries. In its rulings on costs, the tribunal said it was important to distinguish between substantive findings – findings in relation to the matters covered in the tribunal’s terms of reference – and findings in regard to co-operation. People against whom negative substantive findings are made do not lose their entitlement to costs on that basis. The Court of Appeal did not find that the tribunal was in breach of fair procedures in relation to its finding of non-cooperation by Mr Lowry but did find that it was unclear why the tribunal had fixed on the very substantial reduction in costs (two thirds) that it decided upon because of that finding of non-cooperation. On the face of it, it said, it appeared the decision had been made to deprive Mr Lowry of part of the costs of representation at tribunal modules for which there was no allegation of non-cooperation. The reasoning behind this was hard to ascertain, it said. Mr Lowry was represented at the tribunal by solicitors Kelly Noone and a number of different counsel, including the Attorney General, Rossa Fanning. In its decision the Court of Appeal noted that the co-operation of Mr Lowry’s legal representatives with the tribunal had never been doubted. It said it was Mr Lowry’s position that the legal representatives had at that stage (2018) only been paid “a tiny, tiny fraction” of the fees that had been incurred a decade earlier. It also said Mr Lowry’s submission had been that his accountant, Mr O’Connor, had brought a claim for approximately €1.7 million, the bulk of which related to tribunal work. Mr Lowry “does not have the means to discharge such a liability”. In 2014 there was a brief legal dispute between Mr O’Connor and Mr Lowry over the payment of fees to the accountant, with the politician saying there was an oral agreement that the fees would be paid out of the costs he secured from the tribunal, with Mr O’Connor saying the fees were due from Mr Lowry because the tribunal had completed its work. The matter was settled on consent.",0,1
2024/1/7,"Taoiseach dismisses idea of ‘super-election’ in June Comments come amid rising speculation of autumn election Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he is “not planning” for a general election in 2024. There has been much speculation that an election could be called for the autumn after one last Budget delivered by the current Coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party. An election must be held by March 2025. The Fine Gael leader, Mr Varadkar, insisted he was focusing on the Government’s work when asked about the prospect of an early general election. Speaking on RTÉ Radio’s This Week programme, he said: “It is of course the Taoiseach’s prerogative to seek a dissolution of the Dáil and therefore to call an election but I’m not planning an early election.” Mr Varadkar said his focus is on “building more homes, it’s helping families with he cost-of-living, putting more money back into people’s pockets, it’s focusing on law and order, building safer and stronger communities and also safeguarding the economic progress we’ve made”. He said “we’ll fight elections when they come” but also that he has not set a date “nor do I have a date in my mind for the next general election.” Asked if he was ruling out a general election in 2024, he repeated: “Not planning an early election.” He dismissed the chances of a “super-election” in June that would see a general election occurring at the same time as the local and European elections, saying he was “not planning for that”. He denied that decisions by eight Fine Gael TDs not to contest the next election amounted to colleagues throwing in the towel. He said: “They all have their reasons – sometimes it’s age, sometimes it’s health, sometimes it’s other reasons, more personal reasons as well.” Mr Varadkar said retirements are being announced by TDs in other parties as well and it’s “normal in a political process that people will move on for all sorts of different reasons”. Fine Gael will this month start their general election selection conventions to decide on candidates. Mr Varadkar said Dublin Bay South will be first. “That’s exactly the kind of seat we would be planning to gain back at the next general election,” he said, saying not all of the selection conventions will be completed before the local elections. Mr Varadkar said councillors who are successful in the local elections “become the obvious candidate” to run in the general election. Meanwhile, Mr Varadkar insisted there is “no row” between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil over how Ireland’s next European Commissioner will be selected. He would not be drawn on whether he would like Fine Gael politician Mairead McGuinness to remain on at the Commission after her current term ends. Mr Varadkar said there is no written agreement between the Coalition parties on the issue. Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said last month that there is a clear understanding and agreement in the Coalition that the next commissioner will be a Fianna Fáil nominee. Asked about this Mr Varadkar said “that may well be the case but that’s something that we’re going to discuss when the situation arises”. He declined to say if he believed Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance Michael McGrath – upon whom much speculation has centred in relation to the Commission job – would fit the bill, saying: “I’m not going to get into that.” Mr Varadkar said he understood why the question is being asked but added: “there’d be absolutely nothing more than some people would love than to try and create some sort of fake row here between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and between me and Micheál Martin. “There is no row. There’s been no decision or discussion on this. “We will do that most likely June/July when the situation actually arises.” Mr Varadkar was also asked if he plans to stay on in politics if Fine Gael is not in Government after the next election. He said he thinks Fine Gael will be in Government, that its aim is to grow support, and he predicted the party will gain seats. He said he will be contesting the next general election and he is grateful to have been elected by his community on five occasions during his 21 years in politics. Mr Varadkar added: “It’s something that I don’t take for granted and I’m going to continue to work very hard in my job as party leader, as a constituency TD, also as minister and also as Taoiseach.”",0,1
2024/1/8,"UK writes to Irish Government to formally register regret at Troubles legacy legal case Northern Secretary questions move to challenge contentious UK legislation in European Court of Human Rights The UK government has challenged Ireland to set out its own record on tackling legacy issues, as it formally registered its regret at Dublin’s decision to take legal action against its Troubles legislation. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has written to Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin, questioning the move by Ireland’s Government to challenge the UK’s contentious legacy laws in the European Court of Human Rights. The British Ambassador to Ireland Paul Johnston issued the letter on Sunday evening. In it, Mr Heaton Harris again challenges Mr Martin to list the number of prosecutions mounted in the Irish state since 1998 related to Troubles incidents. Aspects of the recently passed UK laws include a limited form of immunity from prosecution for Troubles-related offences for those who co-operate with the new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR). The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 will also halt future civil cases and legacy inquests. The UK Government’s laws are opposed by many victims groups in Northern Ireland and all the main Stormont parties. Announcing the interstate case in December, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said his administration was left with “no option” but to legally challenge the UK Government over the Legacy Act. He said the “strong” legal advice was that the UK Legacy Act breached the United Nations Convention on Human Rights. Mr Martin said they were taking the case reluctantly after having spent time trying to change the UK Government’s mind. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) confirmed to the PA news agency that a letter had been issued formally registering “profound regret” at the interstate case. “The Secretary of State, in his letter, repeats his call for the Irish Government to clarify the number of criminal prosecutions brought in Ireland since 1998 relating to Troubles-related cases, and presses the Irish Government more widely to answer questions regarding its own record on tackling legacy issues in its own jurisdiction,” the NIO said in a statement. The letter criticises the timing of the Irish decision, describing it as a “delicate time” in Northern Ireland amid the efforts to restore powersharing at Stormont. The NIO added: “The decision also comes before the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery, led by Sir Declan Morgan as chief commissioner, is fully established and able to demonstrate its ability to discharge the UK’s international obligations. “The UK government reasserts its particular disappointment that the Irish Government has taken this course of action without, to date, any engagement with the ICRIR to understand better how it intends to implement the legislation and deliver for victims and survivors.” – PA",0,1
2024/1/8,"Spring cost-of-living package ruled out but McGrath hints at USC and income tax cuts in next budget Minister says ‘exceptional interventions’ cannot become the norm and will tapper off  Another spring cost-of-living package has been ruled out by Minister for Finance Michael McGrath who warned that other financial once-off measures must be tapered off as the Government plans to return to smaller-sized budgets. The Minister has also heavily indicated that taxpayers are in line for further USC and income tax cuts in this year’s budget, despite “volatile” corporation tax receipts, some €11bn of which he says cannot be relied upon this year as they could be windfall in nature. Last spring, the Coalition unveiled a €1.3 billion package of cost-of-living measures, including €200 bonus welfare payments and a €100 child benefit top-up. Later in the year, the Cabinet signed off on a €14bn budget which included three energy credits and a double payment of child benefit amongst a raft of other measures. In an interview with The Irish Times, Mr McGrath ruled out a spring package: “It is our intention that the next major fiscal intervention will be the budget later on this year. That is our intention, that there will be no spring package in 2024.” Asked about once-off budgetary measures, such as the €150 energy credits, Mr McGrath significantly dampened any expectation of further exceptional measures. “Those exceptional interventions cannot be the norm and in a more normal economic environment you cannot fund those interventions indefinitely. So it is our intention to revert to a more normal approach to budgetary policy in the future.” “All things being equal, we will see a further tapering off of the one-off exceptional supports that we’ve been providing. The expectation is that the cost of living pressures will ease across 2024 with some key costs that people face falling and incomes rising,” he said. He also said the Government intends to stick to its own spending rule, which sets out to limit the overall increase in spending to 5 per cent annually. “That is our intention for Budget 2025.” Mr McGrath said while he does not see the Universal Social Charge being removed from the tax base in the coming years, he believes “that further progress can be made in reducing the burden of the USC and income tax generally.” “We made good progress in the most recent budget. The full-year cost of the package was about €1.5bn and I do believe that we will be able to do more in the budget later on this year” although he said he could not state how much this year’s tax package would be worth yet. Asked whether he was under pressure to deliver a bonanza budget, given it will fall just before a general election if it is held in early 2025, he said: “the next budget will not be determined by the imminent general election.” “I’m not sure the Irish public rewards governments who bring in budget bonanzas in advance of elections. They want a government that manages the country’s finances responsibly. There are not many countries in the developed world that are in a position to run significant budget surpluses and that are setting up funds with an eye to securing the future for all of us.” The Minister said while inflation figures for December, which showed a monthly increase to 3.2 per cent from 2.5 per cent the previous month, were a “step backwards”, he expects inflation to track downwards this year. “I think we have much to be optimistic about going into 2024, the country is essentially at full employment and notwithstanding the increase in inflation in December, the overall trajectory is downward in nature.” “The December data was a step backwards, but it did come following a very significant reduction in inflation in November. I think you have to assess inflation over a number of months. You have to look at the trend. And the overall trend here is that inflation is falling.”",0,1
2024/1/8,"Tánaiste begins five-day visit to Mexico and Colombia aimed at strengthening relations between countries Micheál Martin says he plans to raise issue of the global drugs trade during trip The Tánaiste has commenced a five-day visit to Mexico and Colombia focused on strengthening relations between the countries and Ireland. Michéal Martin has already said he will also raise the issue of the global drugs trade during the trip. He will begin his visit in Mexico where he will meet foreign minister Alicia Barcena as well as other political figures. He will also deliver an address on foreign policy to senior members of the Mexican diplomatic corps. The Tánaiste will also meet Irish companies that have invested in Mexico. He will join members of the Irish community in Mexico City to honour the memory of the St Patrick’s Battalion (Batallon de San Patricio), a group of mostly Irish soldiers who fought as part of the Mexican army in the 1840s. The Tánaiste will formally open the new premises of the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico City and inaugurate Ireland’s new Office for Central America, which is housed in the Embassy. He will travel to Colombia on Wednesday where he will carry out a number of high-level political meetings, including with minister of defence Ivan Velasquez and deputy foreign minister Francisco Coy. The discussions will focus on big themes in the bilateral relationship, including Ireland’s long-standing support to the Colombian peace process. Commenting on the Mexican leg on the visit, Mr Martin said: “Next year marks 50 years since the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Mexico, although our connections go much further back. These links include Irishmen who fought alongside the Mexican Army in the 1840s, and I will attend, along with members of the Irish community, a ceremony to honour their memory. “I look forward to returning to Mexico, which I last visited as foreign minister in 2009, and discussing with minister Barcena what we can do together to build on the already very strong links between our two countries. Minister Barcena has invited me to address Mexican Ambassadors on foreign policy issues. “To underline Ireland’s commitment to our relationship with Mexico, I will formally open the new Embassy of Ireland premises in Mexico City and inaugurate our Office for Central America, situated in the Embassy. “I will hear from successful Irish investors in Mexico and other business people. Mexico is also Ireland’s largest trading partner in Latin America – with two-way trade in goods and services approaching €5 billion. One of the messages I expect to hear is that there is huge potential to build on this success. “I will also meet members of the resident Irish community and commemorate the actions of the St Patrick’s Battalion.” On the visit to Colombia, the Tánaiste said: “Ireland has long-standing links with Colombia, including the contribution of Cork-born General Daniel Florence O’Leary to the achievement of Colombian independence. “Today, and particularly since the opening of Ireland’s Embassy in Bogotá in 2019, there is an increasingly strong bilateral relationship including considerable Irish investment. “While in Bogotá, I will meet with senior members of the Colombian government, including for discussions on Ireland’s continued support to Colombian efforts to consolidate its peace process. “This has taken on a new emphasis in recent months since Ireland accepted an invitation from the Colombian government to become one of the guarantors in its ongoing peace dialogues.” – PA",0,1
2024/1/8,"Civil servants warned Government against tax breaks for landlords, documents show Officials said move would cause ‘unintended consequences’, records released to Sinn Féin show Department of Finance officials warned against introducing tax breaks for landlords in last October’s budget, documents released to Sinn Féin show. In official documents submitted to evaluate options for tax relief for landlords before the budget, officials warned of the “unintended consequences” of allowing landlords to pay less tax. The officials assessed seven options, argued that each of them had “relatively high associated tax costs” either up front or in the final reckoning and “could have contagion for other tax measures” as they were targeted to landlords specifically. They also had “substantial dead-weight elements” and carried a “risk of unintended consequences”, according to the records which were released following a Freedom of Information request by Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman Pearse Doherty. Opposition in the department to property-related tax incentives is deeply ingrained, with the briefing document recalling the effect of such tax breaks during the Celtic Tiger period. “Previous experience in the not too distant past was that such measures were ultimately disastrous,” the officials told Minister for Finance Michael McGrath, also warning that there was a “significant amount of tax relief” already available to landlords and that “Ireland’s past experience with tax incentives in the property sector strongly suggests the need for a cautionary stance in this area”. They said that a tax relief would only work if tax was a primary factor causing people to exit the market or influencing their decision on becoming a landlord. “The evidence available does not appear to support this case, as such, it raises the question how effective will tax relief be in achieving this aim.” The Government ultimately announced a tax break for landlords who agreed to stay in the market for the next four years, with the ability to earn between €600 and €1,000 each year – but the amount will be clawed back if the landlord doesn’t remain in the market for four years. The officials cited research by the Residential Tenancies Board which found that only 6 per cent of those exiting the market did so because of taxation, arguing that the strength of the housing market and the incentive to sell a property was a more important factor. Mr Doherty said that the tax break was “unjustified”, warning that as a result of the decisions taken on budget day, thousands of landlords would be able to reduce their tax liability to zero when the new tax breaks were combined with capital investments in property which can be written off. ”Officials were also right to warn that this tax break raised serious issues around fairness for our tax system – why should nurses, gardaí, teachers and other workers pay more tax than landlords will on their rental income?” the Donegal TD said. “Given what we and the Government know, recent comments by Minister Darragh O’Brien that landlords will need more tax breaks make clear how out of touch this Government is. “Despite all the evidence and advice from their own officials that this tax break was unfair, costly and ineffective, the Government pressed ahead with an unequitable sop to landlords that will do nothing to increase housing supply or improve affordability.”",0,1
2024/1/8,"Covid inquiry may go without judge as chair to avoid participants ‘lawyering up’ Coalition sources concerned appointment of judge to chair pandemic inquiry could set overly legalistic tone  Fears that leading players from Ireland’s Covid response may “lawyer up” could see plans to install a judge as chair of the pandemic inquiry dropped. With terms of reference for the inquiry being finalised, some Coalition figures are concerned that appointing a judge to chair the inquiry – which will also include an expert panel – could set an overly legalistic tone, leading individuals to frame their engagement around advice from teams of lawyers. Both serving and retired judges have chaired State inquiries and reviews in recent years, with the expectation being that one was to be appointed to lead the Covid review. While the concerns are not universally held, and a figure from the judiciary could still take the role, two Coalition sources said it was possible a person from a non-legal background could be appointed. One source said that appointing a serving judge had already been ruled out, although a second person involved in discussions said no final decisions had been taken and that a judge could still take up the role if they accepted it. It is understood that discussions have not yet been held about the potential for a retired judge to take up the role. Chairs from a judicial background are usually favoured due to the potential for adverse findings to be made by an inquiry, and the importance of adhering to fair procedure in formulating a report. Ireland’s pandemic inquiry has lagged behind other countries’ efforts, with concerns at senior level that choosing the wrong model could see it become bogged down, drawn out and costly, while senior figures involved in the pandemic response have warned against “revisionism”. The level of scrutiny and media attention on the Covid inquiry is expected to be greater than that of other recent inquiries, with the potential for public sessions also likely to attract attention. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said at the weekend that “in many ways” the chair of the inquiry will determine whether the inquiry will be held in public, but he said there will be a public element, with people who want to give public evidence facilitated in so doing – as well as those who would prefer to do so in private or in written form. “What it won’t be about is trying to ascribe blame to individuals or investigating individual decisions by people. We’re not going to go down that road,” he said. He said the purpose would be to examine Ireland’s performance in the pandemic, most importantly what could be learned for facing future disease threats in the future. Coalition figures believe it will be difficult to find someone to assume the responsibilities, with the work of the inquiry expected to take up to 18 months to complete its work. Draft terms of reference for the inquiry are still being worked on and a plan will not be presented to Cabinet on Tuesday, although one is expected in the coming weeks. The inquiry is expected to hear from frontline health workers and families who lost loved ones, but there may not be an entitlement to privilege if allegations against named individuals are made. It is expected to look at the public health response, as well as the economic, social and educational aspects. It will also assess the situation in acute hospitals, in the wider community and in long-term residential care facilities such as nursing homes, which were hit especially hard by Covid. Opposition parties are expected to be consulted over the terms of reference.",0,1
2024/1/8,"Troubles legacy legal case: Irish and UK governments may have to agree to disagree for now Dispute will not aid relations between states but it is unlikely to worsen them as both sides seek to restore Stormont Assembly The Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris had already expressed his “profound regret” at the decision by the Irish Government to take an interstate case against Britain’s controversial Legacy Act at the European Court of Human Rights. On Monday morning, he emphasised it again. In the letter to the Tánaiste Micheál Martin and issued by the British ambassador to Ireland, Paul Johnston, Heaton-Harris formally registered the UK’s opposition to the Irish decision by reiterating the points made in his public response to the announcement in December. In both cases the Northern Secretary criticised the timing of Dublin’s decision – taken, depending on which version you read, at either a “sensitive” or “delicate” time politically for Northern Ireland given efforts to restore the Assembly and Executive – and expressed the UK’s disappointment that it had not engaged with the new legacy investigations body, the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR). He also called on the Irish Government to “urgently clarify” the number of Troubles prosecutions brought in Ireland post-1998. All part of diplomatic choreography, up to a point; the Northern Secretary’s move is also evidence of the extent to which, politically, London is smarting over Dublin’s action and wants to make clear its discontent. In so doing, it has also hit back; a strategically-timed briefing to PA on Sunday night ensured the letter led the Northern news cycle on Monday morning. The initial, brief, response from the Tánaiste – beginning a five-day visit to Mexico and Colombia – was to confirm he was aware of the letter and that he would respond “in due course”. Dublin has already made its position clear; its feeling is that it – and many others – have repeatedly raised concerns about the legislation, which were not listened to, and it had no alternative but to challenge it in the European Court of Human Rights. As London has made equally clear, this is not its view. Behind its attack on the Irish Government’s approach to legacy is the conviction that, however imperfect, at the least the UK is doing something. Criticism of Ireland’s approach is not new; victims and survivors group the South East Fermanagh Foundation (SEFF) has long made this argument, stating as recently as September that many victims of the Troubles in the South “feel second class citizens [compared] with their northern counterparts” and that the Irish state has “refused ... to fully embrace the problem and legacy of the Troubles.” But this, for SEFF or anyone else aside from the UK government and veterans groups, does not equate to support for the Legacy Act; it is to state the obvious to point out that what another government is doing or not doing will not fly as an argument before the European Court of Human Rights. This latest war of words aside, in the short term the two states may have to settle for agreeing to disagree; though it will not help Anglo-Irish relations, it is unlikely to worsen them further, with both sides understood to be keen not to let it spill over and disrupt efforts to restore Stormont. But, with a judgment expected shortly on a legal challenge to the Legacy Act taken in the High Court in Belfast, do not expect this diplomatic row to go away any time soon.",0,1
2024/1/9,"Ireland ‘is not full’, Eamon Ryan says, as Cabinet discusses accommodation for Ukrainian refugees Ministers approved plans to limit accommodation and welfare payments for those fleeing Russian invasion Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said Ireland cannot turn its back on Ukrainian refugees, saying that Ireland is “not full”. Arriving to Cabinet on Tuesday, where Ministers approved plans to limit the accommodation offering to those fleeing the Russian invasion and to cut their welfare payments, Mr Ryan said the State could rise to the challenge of accommodating increasing numbers of refugees and asylum seekers. The Minister for the Environment said he “absolutely” backed comments by Tánaiste Micheál Martin, who argued that the Government had not done a u-turn on the plan to put single men who are seeking International Protection into a disused hotel in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo. He said the situation was “very challenging” but “we can and will manage that, as a Government, and as a country – we’re not full”. He said “we can’t turn our back” on the Ukrainian people and that shelter and refuge would be provided but “in a way we can manage”. It had to be done in a way that wasn’t a “chaotic system”. Mr Ryan said burning accommodation down when the number of beds were tight hinders the problem, arguing that solutions had to “work for everyone”, including local people and those arriving in. He said there would be an effort in the coming weeks to explain “basic mechanics” of what happens in the migration process and “why we have to play our part”. “We cannot isolate, shut our country off, say we’re not going to play our part in providing refuge where refuge is needed.” He said the Government’s job was to “address and to clarify” fears of communities. He said blockading, burning buildings and the idea that communities had a veto would not work for the country. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that roughly 100,000 Ukrainians have come to Ireland, and about 80,000 are still here.  “And we’ve been able to provide them with accommodation, education, healthcare, in many cases employment too. I think in 10 or 20 years-time we’ll look back on this and be very proud of what we’ve done as a country in welcoming so many people who have been fleeing war in Ukraine,” he said. Mr Varadkar said the Government expected that the numbers arriving from Ukraine will start to reduce. “It’s our expectation that because we’ve brought what we offer more into line with what’s the case in other western European countries that the numbers coming in will fall. But it’s not just about that. Let’s not forget why people are here. They’re fleeing a really brutal war in Ukraine and when we survey them and ask them why they come to Ireland’s they say there’s two main reasons: that it’s English speaking and very far away from Russia. Those things are not going to change.” “What I hope will change is the course of the war in Ukraine so that Ukraine can be successful in the war and the war will come to an end and then we can start to talk to people here in Ukraine about the possibility of going home but we’re not at that point at this stage,” he added. Separately Eamon Ryan said that increased policing and new laws would help reduce the number of road deaths, following a surge in fatalities on the roads in 2023, along with the deployment of more cameras in what he said was a “multilayered response”. He added that the fatalities recorded in the first few days of the new year was “deeply worrying”.",0,1
2024/1/9,"Varadkar and Martin circulated as names for top Brussels job after surprise resignation European Council president Charles Michel’s decision to step down prompts speculation Leo Varadkar and  Micheál Martin may be considered for role A surprise announcement by the president of the European Council that he will resign to contest the European Parliament elections has fired the starting gun on a race for top jobs in Brussels, with both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste mentioned as possible successors. The job involves chairing discussions of European Union leaders, setting their agenda and brokering compromises, and the national leaders prefer to elect former heads of government as they bring the desired experience and statesmanlike status to the role. Though neither is seen as a frontrunner, the names of both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Micheál Martin have been among those circulating in Brussels as potential candidates, sources close to the matter say. They would represent their centre-right European People’s Party and liberal Renew groups respectively, and their appointment would depend on how complex political negotiations play out. It is unclear whether either would be interested in the job. This weekend, Mr Varadkar said he intended to contest the coming general election due by March 2025, while Mr Martin said in November that he would lead Fianna Fáil into the next election. The current office holder is Charles Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium in the Renew group who has held the role since 2019. His decision to run for the European Parliament, announced this weekend, brings forward the end of his mandate as European Council president from November to June. The move has ignited discussions of candidates for all the top roles in Brussels, from the president of the European Commission to the European Parliament, as the jobs are typically divided up between political parties in a package deal between the largest political groups. European Union national leaders are set to discuss how to dole out the jobs at a summit in Brussels in June, and their decisions should reflect which parties emerge with the biggest mandates from the European elections that take place from June 6th-9th. Portuguese Socialist leader Antonio Costa had been considered a frontrunner to succeed Mr Michel before his official residence was raided by police in November and authorities said he was being investigated as part of a corruption probe, forcing him to resign though he has denied any wrongdoing. The Socialists, who make up the second-largest political group in the EU as the centre-left block, also have potential alternative candidates in the form of Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez, Finland’s Sanna Marin and Italy’s Enrico Letta. If the position is kept in the hands of the liberal Renew group, Mr Martin’s potential rivals could include Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, Estonia’s Kaja Kallas, Luxembourg’s Xavier Bettel, and Belgium’s prime minister Alexander De Croo, who did not rule himself out when asked about the position on Monday while saying his first focus was coming Belgian national elections. Tactful consensus-builders are valued for the role and Mr Martin’s modest personality is seen as a point in his favour. However, being associated with a pro-Palestinian position may make him controversial among a handful of EU member states, given the current prominence of the issue. The centre-right EPP has few clear candidates, making space for Mr Varadkar if he was interested, but the job is unlikely to go to someone from that political group if European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen retains her job for a second term as expected, as it would put too many top jobs in the hands of the same party. Mr Michel’s announcement has piled pressure on Dr von der Leyen to make her intentions clear. He told journalists he was entering the election race because it was important for European leaders to have public legitimacy, a subtle dig at his bitter rival at the head of the commission who was nominated by leaders without running in the European elections and may be so again.

2024/10/10,"Micheál Martin says he was never briefed about alleged Russian spy in the Oireachtas Peadar Tóibín says Senators ‘sniggered like giddy children’ as they denied being reported infiltrator during Seanad sitting Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said it is “unacceptable” for intelligence information to have been released to the media if reported allegations of a Russian spy in the Oireachtas are true. Mr Martin told the Dáil on Thursday that he did not know who the person was, or if the story was true, but that as Minister for Defence he had never been briefed about there being a spy in the Dáil or Seanad. The Fianna Fáil leader said he had “real concerns about how all of this has emerged into the public arena”. Mr Martin said he was taoiseach during the dates when this individual was allegedly recruited. “I received security briefings but I was never told and never briefed that there was a spy in the Oireachtas,” he added. A Sunday Times report alleged that an Oireachtas member, nicknamed “Cobalt”, had been recruited during Brexit talks but had not been paid and had not accessed sensitive information. Mr Martin said “there is an issue of accountability in terms of our intelligence services, because if this is true, then someone gave that information out and I don’t think that’s acceptable”. The Tánaiste was responding to Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín, who said it was “scandalous” to think that a member “elected to represent the interests of the Irish people would allow themselves to be manipulated to work in the interests of a foreign government”. “It is actually treacherous,” he added. Mr Tóibín referred to the Seanad, where the issue had been raised on Wednesday, and a number of Senators said in a tongue-in-cheek manner that they were not a spy. “Members of the Seanad sniggered like giddy children. It looked like an episode of Killinascully,” the Meath West TD said. He told Mr Martin: “You’re the Minister for Defence and you receive national security briefings. You know who the individual is. What are you going to do to ensure that this person is held to account?” The Tánaiste said he did not know who the person was and had received no briefing about any spy in the Oireachtas. “I’m actually very surprised at the degree to which everybody, herd-like, has just grabbed on to the story and said ‘who is the person’?” He said he was surprised that all the political interest was “in one direction and not in the other”. Mr Martin said there is a broader issue that future governments, TDs and Senators need to be very clear about, which was that “intelligence services have an accountability chain and are accountable” in a democracy. He said a national security strategy was being developed “and we lack that at the moment”. “I’m not comfortable with the situation pertaining to intelligence. It’s very important that we have intelligence. It’s very important in terms of the external dimension and our Defence Forces to a very good and necessary job in the protection of our country,” he said.",0,1
2024/10/10,"‘Intimidatory behaviour’ by Israeli forces to UN peacekeepers in Lebanon unacceptable, says Harris Taoiseach says ‘Israel will have to be judged on what it does and not what it says’ amid ‘concerning’ loss of civilian life “Intimidatory behaviour” by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) towards United Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon is utterly unacceptable and must be protested at the highest level, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. Speaking to reporters at Georgetown University on Thursday as his two-day visit to Washington DC concluded, Mr Harris said he had discussed the situation in the Middle East with Joe Biden just hours after the US president spoke with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. He said the conversation he had with Mr Biden had “left me in no doubt of the significance of what he had discussed with the prime minister of Israel”. The Taoiseach said that, more broadly, “Israel will have to be judged on what it does and not what it says.” “What happened today is extraordinarily concerning,” he said of the targeting of peacekeepers. “The loss of civilian life is concerning, the incursion into Lebanon, the bombing of Gaza is beyond concerning, it is despicable, but actually there is very clear international law about peacekeeping. And I think the intimidatory behaviour towards peacekeepers is utterly unacceptable and must be protested at the highest level.” Mr Harris gave an address in the Riggs library in Georgetown, attended by Ireland’s Ambassador to the United States Geraldine Byrne Nason and students, to conclude his visit. Before he departed, Mr Harris said he would meet the family of Aoife Johnston, who died of meningitis almost two years ago after being left untreated for sepsis in University Hospital Limerick’s overcrowded emergency department for more than 12 hours. “I have met with them before,” he said. “They are a beautiful family grieving the loss of a beautiful daughter in the most horrific, unacceptable and somewhat inexplicable circumstances.” The late 16-year-old’s family have been seeking a statutory inquiry into the failings that led to Aoife’s death, and Mr Harris said he would not rule out one taking place. “The family has said very clearly through their representative that they have questions to be answered. We have to work with them so I think the first thing to do is for myself and minister Donnelly to meet with the family. I am very happy for that to take place as quickly as possible.” The Taoiseach also referenced the uncertainty over the scholarship initiative named after Georgetown alumnus George Mitchell, which was set up in the late 1990s but is now in doubt because of an insufficient long-term funding model. He said the Government was having “active conversations” as to what the structure of the scheme should be going forward. He said resources will not be an issue but the Government will want a return for funding the scholarships. “I have spoken directly to Senator Mitchell about this as recently as last week in Dublin. But we do want to get this model right. Not to in any way besmirch anything that went before it ... And I think we could do something a lot bigger in relation to impact and numbers. And we just want to get that right. But it will be resourced.” The Fine Gael leader’s trip to the US was meant to mark the centenary of Ireland-United States diplomatic relations, but the impending arrival of Hurricane Milton caused a planned garden party to be cancelled on Wednesday. “I don’t yet know when the Rose Garden ceremony will be but I know president Biden would hope to have that during his time in office, whether I am here or another member of the Government, that remains to be seen,” Mr Harris said. “But the most important thing I wanted to do was to engage directly with the president of the United States and to have almost an hour of the president’s time in the Oval Office is important and significant.”",0,1
2024/10/12,"Miriam Lord’s Week: Fine Gael’s poster boys undercut party message on timing of election The temperature is rising in Leinster House: telltale signs of a late November election are mounting, despite the denials Evidence pointing to a late November election continues to pile up, despite the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste’s increasingly wan insistence that it will be happening next year. If the fervent wishes of all those in Leinster House were enough to influence a decision, it would be called tomorrow. RTÉ’s Fiachra Ó Cionnaith’s tweeted a telltale photo this week of pallets of Fianna Fáil election posters shrink-wrapped with hundreds of smiling Micheál Martins and a slogan on the front plaintively whispering “Moving Forward Together” and “With Whoever Will Have Us” on the reverse. And as the parties attempt to stuff as much money into the coffers as possible before the election is called, Fine Gael supporters are noting with interest that the date of its Superdraw money-raising lottery has been brought forward from December 5th. There is major deck-clearing going on in Government Buildings. Sinn Féin is currently banjaxed. Jennifer Bray reports elsewhere on its latest catastrophe where they’re tearing the party to shreds in Kildare. Oh, and here’s what some see as the clincher. The Late Late Toy Show airs this year on December 6th, with “insiders” swearing that programme planners in Montrose moved it back from its traditional slot at the end of November to avoid a possible clash with general election coverage. And all those Fine Gael posters and billboards appearing like a rash on gable walls and bus shelters throughout the land. Like the billboard promising “A new energy for Kildare South” with candidates Joe Neville, Evie Sammon and Bernard Durkan alongside high-wattage Simon Harris beaming down on the masses. FG’s runners in Kildare South must have been shocked to see it. The aforementioned candidates are actually standing in Kildare North. The sense of indecent haste continues with Cllr John Paul O’Shea, the party’s candidate in Cork North West, ending up on the side of a bus shelter in Listowel, birthplace of Billy O’Shea, Fine Gael’s actual candidate in Kerry. And hats off to Minister for Higher Education Patrick O’Donovan, spectacularly ignoring his Government’s line that the election will be next year with huge billboards in Limerick. Featuring one huge photo of Patrick’s smiley phizog, it bears a simple message, writ large: “Patrick O’Donovan TD. Your Cabinet Minister for Limerick.” Nah. It’ll be in February. With TDs and senators all of a dither this week over claims that one of their own is a Russian secret agent, we were surprised not to hear the stentorian tones of former soldier Senator Gerard Craughwell holding forth on this critical issue of national security. Members of the Upper House have seemed far more exercised on this matter than their Dáil counterparts. Rear-Admiral Craughwell, who recently put the wind up Putin by threatening to send out a flotilla of finger-wagging Irish parliamentarians to monitor Russian naval manoeuvres in Irish waters, takes a keen interest in defence matters and his observations on the unfolding espionage crisis were much anticipated. Gerard, however, has been deeply involved in manoeuvres of a different kind. He is busy ensuring his re-election to the Seanad. A member of the Seanad’s independent group of senators, he was first elected in 2014, unexpectedly winning a by-election on the Cultural and Education panel after Fine Gael’s shoo-in candidate became embroiled in a row over government stroke politics and withdrew from the race. Despite it being incredibly tough for an independent to win in a contest where elected local politicians control the vote, he has managed to keep his seat by keeping the councillors sweet. This year, he splashed out on over 940 lapel badges and posted one to every councillor in the country. The pins, produced by Abbey Badges in Blackrock, are attractive items and have been “well received” says Senator Craughwell. “You will note the pins are unique with the name of the council on top, the council coat of arms and ‘elected June 2024′ at the bottom,” he tells us. “They are a mark of recognition and a collector’s item.” Each pin comes with a card from Gerard congratulating them on their success. “Wear it with pride for all that you have accomplished. Keep up the good work!” He also encloses full details of his particulars in case anyone wants to take them down. The race for the next Seanad may not have officially started, but it’s already in full swing. “Be sure I will run!” parps the bullish Craughwell. Of the many tributes paid to Mary O’Rourke since her death just over a week ago, one of the more interesting ones came from Ivan Yates, who was Fine Gael spokesman on public enterprise when Mary ran the department. Speaking on his weekly podcast with Matt Cooper, Ivan was full of praise for the political acumen of his erstwhile sparring partner – but he didn’t rate her at all as a minister. He was very firmly on the side of Brian Joyce, the former chairman of CIÉ who resigned on her ministerial watch citing “interference”, among other things. After the bombshell broke, Mary was shocked, breathlessly telling Morning Ireland how she heard the news. Ivan spoke vaguely of the way “this pressure came up”, which led to Mary revealing to the nation that she was “in the bath listening to the totally unannounced, unexpected resignation of Mr Joyce”. He regaled himself with details of his heroic part in this affair – how he played a blinder on the same programme a short time later, noting that after she went on about her bath “she proceeded to completely drop the towel and put the knife into Mr Joyce in a quite outrageous way”. Then they clashed on Prime Time, where she continued “savaging” Joyce while “letting on she didn’t know anything about it [the resignation] but she absolutely garrotted him”. Mary O’Rourke may not be around now to contradict him, but Richard Moore, her media adviser at the time, offers a more detailed timeline of what happened all those ago. It’s a tale full of drama and intrigue and he has never spoken about it before. That memorable bath and resignation episode happened on a Tuesday morning in the year 2000. On the previous day, Monday, March 6th, Mary was due to appear on RTÉ's Questions and Answers. There would, doubtless, be a question on the ongoing rows between her and her CIÉ chairman over how the organisation and, in particular, the rail system was funded and run. Joyce was appointed by Fine Gael in 1995 and had been due to retire in November 2000. Relations between them were always poor and Mary had been demanding a meeting with CIÉ’s chief executive later that week to discuss the company’s performance. Sadly, in a heartbreaking turn of events, the programme was cancelled due to the unexpected death of the presenter’s son. On Tuesday morning, The Irish Times splashed with a front page exclusive by Arthur Beesley. The story, with its leaked details, was filed on Monday night. Brian Joyce had resigned because of Mary O’Rourke’s “interference”. This came as a bolt from the blue to the Department. The usual practice if the chair of a semi-state was going to resign (or write a stern rebuke) was to call the Minister’s office first to let them know to expect a very important letter. That never happened in this case, recalls Richard Moore. Instead, Joyce’s resignation letter was hand-delivered to the minister’s office in Kildare Street after 8pm on Monday evening when she would have been in RTÉ, had circumstances not intervened. It was accepted by the security/service officer on duty and the unknown individual who delivered it said nothing about alerting the Minister or the Department to its importance. It was eventually opened on Tuesday, well after its contents had been revealed by The Irish Times. And well after RTÉ led its 7am radio bulletin with a report based on Beesley’s scoop. When she heard it, a stunned Mary immediately rang her media adviser. He headed straight into the office, getting in at 7.30am to find her already at her desk. She spoke to Morning Ireland after the 8am bulletin, famously declaring where she was when she heard the shock news. Afterwards, some commentators described the sharing of this detail as a masterstroke. All anyone could remember was that she was in the bath when somebody resigned and the story quickly faded. But back to RTÉ, where the plot thickens. Had Q&A not been cancelled at the last minute, Mary would have been on the panel with Fine Gael’s Jim Mitchell. A view quickly formed in Fianna Fáil circles – one shared by Moore – that the Minister escaped an ambush that night. Inevitably, she would have been asked about her troubled relationship with CIÉ and answered it with her usual confidence, only for someone – possibly the late Mr Mitchell – to remark if she was such a great minister, how come her chairman had resigned? Cue bafflement, consternation ... carnage. There is a delicious final twist. Much later on that fateful Tuesday, the then minister of state Mary Hanafin contacted O’Rourke about a strange voice message someone had left on her mobile phone. Richard Moore says it went something like: “Hello Ivan, I think matters have worked out well; let me know what else I can do.” In those days, TDs were allocated phones with sequenced numbers. There was (and still is) a one-digit difference between the phone numbers of Ivan Yates and Mary Hanafin. Back then, she was used to people leaving messages placing bets on horses. Yates was a bookie as well as an ambitious politician. O’Rourke believed she had her “gotcha!” moment. Her team downloaded Hanafin’s recording on to cassette tapes with a view to releasing it to the media at a snap press conference. It would have been sensational, particularly as the man who thought he was ringing Ivan Yates (and who did not get on with O’Rourke) gave his first name. But in the end they decided against it. Moore, who went on to set up a successful communications consultancy, felt this would complicate the unfolding resignation commentary – which was going well for his minister, while it might be best not to remind people of Fianna Fáil’s past history with recording phone calls. It took a lot of persuading, but Mary agreed to say nothing. A hard ask for the woman concerned, but she kept her part of the bargain.",0,1
2024/10/12,"Gráinne Seoige: Can she reconcile her celebrity with parish pump politics? The GAA has traditionally provided Irish politics with instantly recognisable ‘names’ but more recently broadcasters have joined the fray The late US House of Representatives speaker Tip O’Neill’s famous dictum that “all politics is local” has always had a powerful resonance in rural Ireland. If you don’t mind your parish pump, you will be punished by your community. In 1987, Labour leader Dick Spring had been tánaiste in an outgoing coalition government and yet limped into the last seat with a margin of only four votes to spare. He never repeated that mistake again and become more attentive to the needs of his constituents. Gráinne Seoige caused a stir when she announced she would be contesting Fianna Fáil’s Galway West selection convention in September. A household name, a well-known national broadcaster and now a bona fide celebrity candidate. The Irish Times made an early bid for an interview with Seoige and a provisional arrangement was made for September 24th. It was put back, initially to early October and then to the middle of this month. It still hasn’t happened. Seoige commands attention, even though it has been more than a decade since she was at the summit of Irish broadcasting, when she had her own afternoon show on RTÉ. The critical tests of her electability, however, will not be colour spreads in national broadsheets or on the strength of her name. She has to show she is familiar with O’Neill’s mantra, specifically in her native Connemara. The first big test of Seoige’s mettle in that regard occurred last Tuesday on Raidió na Gaeltachta’s Adhmhaidin. Presenter Gormfhlaith Ní Thuairisg grilled her about the Government’s budget allocation of €107 million to the State’s Gaeltacht regions and the Irish language, which has been subject to loud local criticism. In effortless Connemara Irish, Seoige defended it to the hilt, saying that €107 million was a huge amount of money. When it was put to her that her party colleague Éamon Ó Cuív – the person whose shoes she is aiming to fill – had expressed acute disappointment at the allocation, she replied that their views differed on the matter. It was an important interview and one which she survived, but not unscathed. Seoige (50), is from Cnoc, a small Irish-speaking community a few kilometres west of An Spidéal. The eldest of four children, she has a sister and two brothers. She has a son, Conall (now 30) who was born while she was a student at the University of Galway. After completing a postgraduate course in broadcasting, Seoige was the main newscaster when Telifís na Gaeilge was launched in 1998. Subsequently she worked as a news broadcaster for TV3, Sky News Ireland and ITV before moving to RTÉ to co-present the Seoige show along with her younger sister, Síle. The show ended after three seasons. Her appearances on RTÉ became less frequent – she hosted the monthly Crimecall programme for a number of years. She has maintained a presence on social media platforms. She was married to former TV3 sports broadcaster Stephen Cullinane but the couple divorced in 2010. She married a former South African rugby coach, Leon Jordan, in 2019. Three years previously they had moved to South Africa where she had set up a diamond business. The couple returned to live in Ireland after the Covid pandemic. While she was born and raised in the Gaeltacht and has strong family connections from An Spidéal to Ros Muc she has lived outside of Connemara for most of her working life and some would say she no longer has that connection with the constituency, or to the language, that her Fianna Fáil running mate, long-serving city councillor John Connolly (another native speaker), has. “The thing that struck me about her RnaG interview is that Ó Cuív would never have defended the budget allocation,” said one close observer of Galway politics. “He has always had one foot in Fianna Fáil and the other foot in the constituency. “Perhaps, being new, she was being loyal and toeing the party line. She needs to learn she also has to be loyal to the constituency.” A former colleague in Irish-speaking media said Seoige has many attributes as a communicator but asked, would they be enough? “I just can’t see her doing what Ó Cuiv has done, going to the sheep marts in Maam Cross, to the many local meetings, and to all the matches and pony shows.” “Seoige is one of two parachute candidates” who will be standing in the general election for Fianna Fáil. The other, journalist and newscaster Alison Comyn, was added to the Fianna Fáil ticket in Louth. The party’s decision to run two candidates with profile but no experience in politics may well have been inspired by the success of former TV presenter Cynthia Ní Mhurchú, who took a seat in Ireland South in June’s European elections. Those elections were a celebrity-rich environment, with former Rose of Tralee Maria Walsh securing re-election, former RTÉ correspondent Ciarán Mullooly taking a seat and Niall Boylan, presenter of a late-night no-holds-barred radio show, putting in a respectable showing. And then there was jockey Nina Carberry, who did no meaningful or in-depth interviews during the campaign but was elected in the Midlands-North-West constituency largely on the back of her name. Comyn says she chuckles when she hears herself described as “a celebrity candidate”. Yes, she has been a broadcaster for Sky News, RTÉ, BBC and UTV, Comyn says, but she is firmly ensconced in her native Drogheda. “I think there’s a huge difference between being well known and being a celebrity,” she says. “I am well known in the area. I’ve been a hard-working journalist for 30 years, so a lot of it might have been on the telly, but I don’t think I swagger along any red carpets. “I have covered hundreds and hundreds of county council meetings, Drogheda Borough Council meetings, joint policing committee meetings. There’s nothing glamorous about those.” Comyn insists she was not dropped in, saying Fianna Fáil had no candidate in Drogheda, unlike the north of the county, where Senator Erin McGreehan is running. “It has happened a few times that a journalist will move to politics and you are really pinning your colours to a mast,” she says. “And I was always very proud to have been considered impartial. The fact that people don’t know what your politics are means that you’re doing your job correctly as a journalist.” Comyn felt the time was right. From a fifth-generation Drogheda family, she felt the town was slipping behind while still expanding. She wants it to be a city in its own right, not just a satellite of Dublin or Dundalk. The other motivating factor was that Drogheda has not had a Fianna Fáil TD elected for 70 years. “So now it’s tricky. I’ve had to take unpaid leave from my position. You can’t, obviously, be a journalist and run as a candidate. I think it’s a risk well worth taking. I’m embedded in the community so it does feel like a bit of a natural transition,” she says Traditionally, Irish celebrity candidates have tended to come from the GAA world. In 2010, journalist Conor McMorrow wrote a book on GAA stars who became TDs and was able to pick a full team of 15, with a few subs to boot. They included a 1916 hero, Austin Stack (Kerry football legend); a taoiseach, Jack Lynch (who won six All-Ireland medals for Cork in hurling and football); a tánaiste, John Wilson (a member of the Cavan 1947 and 1948 All-Ireland winning sides); and numerous ministers, including Jimmy Deenihan, who won five All-Ireland medals with Kerry. The phenomenon continues. Mayo TD and Minister of State Alan Dillon is a former Mayo intercounty star. Fine Gael’s candidate in Kerry, Billy O’Shea, is also a well-known former county player. The other big source of “names” has been broadcasting. EU commissioner Mairéad McGuinness was a TV presenter before her election in 2004. The RTÉ journalist George Lee won a byelection in Dublin South by a landslide in 2009 for Fine Gael, but was naive in his expectations as to what he could achieve. Within a year, he had resigned, complaining that Fine Gael had used him only as a “show pony”. Parachute candidates have tended to do better in European elections. As second-tier elections and with sprawling constituencies, national name recognition is more important. It doesn’t always work. Orla Guerin, then an RTÉ journalist, failed to be elected for the Dublin constituency in the 1990s. A few very prominent former GAA players – Barney Rock (Dublin), Graham Geraghty (Meath) and the legendary Mick O’Connell (Kerry) failed in their bids for the Dáil. And what about Gráinne Seoige? A colleague who worked with her in the past says: “She’s tough but if she was a man that quality would be admired. “In my experience, she is smart, she is focused and there’s no denying she is interested in politics. She also likes to be in the limelight. I would not discount her at all. She is a hard worker. We have had all sorts in the Dáil. If she gets elected, she could surprise you at how good she may be.”",0,1
2024/10/13,"Taoiseach defends reopening of Irish Embassy in Iran Simon Harris says staff safety of ‘paramount’ importance but stresses benefits of ongoing diplomatic relations with Iran The Taoiseach has defended the decision to reopen an Embassy in Iran. The conflict between Iran and Israel has escalated to direct missile strikes in opposing territory. Simon Harris said the safety of staff at the Irish Embassy was of “paramount” importance but stressed the benefits of ongoing diplomatic relations with Iran. “The safety of any diplomat or local staff who would work in any structure would, of course, be a factor in terms of deciding when to physically open a building, where to do it, how to keep them secure,” he said. The Irish Embassy in Tehran closed in 2012 due to the impact of the financial crisis. In 2021 then foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney announced the re-establishment of an Irish diplomatic presence in Iran. That year, a charge d’affaires was posted to Tehran, joined later by other staff. Ambassador-designate Laoise Moore arrived in the city at the start of last month but has yet to be offered a date to present her credentials formally to Iranian officials. The Department of Foreign Affairs has insisted it is normal for ambassadors to have to wait for weeks or months before a date is offered to formally present credentials. “This does not preclude the Ambassador-designate managing the work of the mission over the intervening period,” it said. “In this instance, a date for our Ambassador-designate in Tehran to present her credentials has not yet been fixed.” The department said the full embassy team was now in place and the embassy was in operation. In November 2022 a number of Fine Gael parliamentarians wrote to the then-minister for foreign affairs Simon Coveney asking him to stall or cancel the reopening of the Irish Embassy in Tehran. That was in the wake of the death in Tehran of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. She died after being arrested by morality police for not wearing her hijab correctly. Mr Coveney said, at that time, that the Government was “not ploughing ahead” with the reopening, which was “under review”. Mr Harris said there was a misconception that diplomatic relations with Iran were only being established now, adding: “They’ve already existed – the question now is the infrastructure you put in place on the ground and, of course, the security situation in the region will be paramount in our mind.” The Taoiseach said ongoing relations with Iran were “significant” in the release of an Irish national. Bernard Phelan, a 64-year-old Irish-French national originally from Clonmel in Co Tipperary, was jailed for seven months in northeast Iran after being arrested in Mashhad in October 2022. He was accused of providing information to an enemy country – charges he denied. He experienced significant ill health while in custody. Mr Phelan was released on humanitarian grounds earlier this year. Mr Harris added that having diplomatic relations was “not the same as agreeing with a country”. “I mean, we have diplomatic relations with Russia – we utterly deplore the actions of Russia,” he said. “We have diplomatic relations with Israel when I’m very clear Israel, in my view, is continuing to engage on a war on children in Gaza. “So, we can have diplomatic relations with a country and continue to call out that.” The Irish Embassy is operating in space provided by the embassy of Germany – with a view to opening a new premises early next year. – PA",0,1
2024/10/14,"Unifil forces to remain in place in southern Lebanon despite calls from Israel to move Defence Forces confirm all Irish peacekeepers accounted for and well, as Tánaiste condemns ‘war crime’ in northern Gaza The UN will reject calls by Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu for Unifil forces, including Irish troops, to withdraw from positions in southern Lebanon, according to Irish Government sources. Diplomats from countries contributing to the peacekeeping force have been advised that Unifil is determined, against the backdrop of a very difficult situation, to continue implementing the mandate given by the UN Security Council. The Defence Forces confirmed on Sunday afternoon that all Irish peacekeepers are accounted for and well, and that the situation around Irish positions in south Lebanon remains relatively calm. “This environment has allowed the successful resupply of food and water to UNP 2-45. Clashes between both parties to the conflict persist in both the Irish and wider Unifil area of operations. Irish peacekeepers continue to monitor and report any violations of UNSCR 1701 by all parties involved, maintaining an independent and impartial stance,” the Defence Forces said in a statement. But the wider situation remains fraught. Mr Netanyahu made his call on Sunday as Unifil said that Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops crossed the Blue Line into Lebanon early Sunday morning and entered a UN position. It said that Unifil troops suffered smoke-related injuries during one of the incidents at the UN outpost in Ramyah. Tánaiste Micheál Martin said that “the attacks on Unifil peacekeepers by the IDF we have seen in recent days are completely unacceptable and reprehensible”. Mr Martin issued one of his sharpest criticisms yet of Israeli actions when he called an Israeli assault on Jabilia in northern Gaza “a war crime”. Gaza’s health ministry said the eight-day-old Israeli incursions in the north have so far killed dozens of Palestinians, with dozens of others feared dead on roads and under rubble of their houses, beyond the reach of medical teams. “An entire population is being encircled and forced out, with nowhere for them to go. This represents a mass expulsion of people from their homeland. It is a war crime, and the international community must use every lever at its disposal to pressure Israel to stop this war,” the Fianna Fáil leader said. Taoiseach Simon Harris said: “This deliberate targeting and abuse of civilians must stop. Civilian populations are protected under international humanitarian law. Targeting them shows flagrant disregard for international law and all human rights norms and is a war crime,” he said. The comments from the two Government leaders come as updated advice from the Attorney General about the Occupied Territories Bill – which would outlaw imports from illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land – is expected to be presented to the Coalition party leaders this evening. The Attorney General, Rossa Fanning, has re-examined the issue in the light of a ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last July. The Bill was previously blocked as the Government said it contravened EU law, but that position may have changed since the ICJ opinion.",0,1
2024/10/14,"Safety of Irish peacekeepers in Lebanon is paramount, Taoiseach tells Israeli president Taoiseach Simon Harris speaks with Israeli President Yitzhak Herzog about ‘deteriorating situation’ in region Taoiseach Simon Harris spoke with Israeli President Yitzhak Herzog on Monday to relay the Government’s “serious concern about the deteriorating situation in southern Lebanon”. Speaking by phone with the Israeli President, the Taoiseach emphasised the Government’s expectation that Unifil’s role and mandate be “fully respected at all times”. He said the security of Irish peacekeepers serving in the region was “paramount”. The Taoiseach was “clear that the deliberate firing at Unifil posts is an outrageous and totally unacceptable breach of international law,” a statement from his office, sharing detail about the phone call, said. Harris’s phone call with the Israeli President comes after several Unifil peacekeepers were injured in recent days. Unifil said Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops crossed the Blue Line into Lebanon early Sunday morning and entered a UN position. It said that Unifil troops suffered smoke-related injuries during one of the incidents at the UN outpost in Ramyah. Ireland has cosigned, with 33 other Unifil-contributing countries, a statement initiated by Poland condemning recent incidents in Lebanon and calling for the safety of UN personnel to be respected. The Taoiseach’s phone call with the Israeli President “made it clear” that Unifil must be allowed to carry out its functions unimpeded, and explained the long tradition of members of the Irish Defence Forces serving in Lebanon. The Taoiseach called for an immediate ceasefire. He also “took the opportunity to express the Government’s sincere condolences to the Israeli people” on the recent anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel of October 7th, and expressed his solidarity with the family and friends of those who continue to be held hostage, who he said “should be released immediately and without condition”.",0,1
2024/10/14,"Sinn Féin says it told Brian Stanley to go to gardaí with concerns he raised during inquiry Party inquiry understood to have reached preliminary conclusion of gross misconduct against Laois-Offaly TD before he resigned at weekend Sinn Féin has said it told Brian Stanley to go to the gardaí with concerns he raised during an inquiry into a complaint against him. Amid a deepening controversy, the party last night hit back against suggestions from its former TD that it should have reported concerns he raised during an internal disciplinary process in September. Mr Stanley resigned as a Sinn Féin member on Saturday evening, citing a “kangaroo court” set up by the party after a complaint was made about him in late July. His resignation was followed by a referral of the matter to the garda by Sinn Féin, which has in turn been criticised for not doing so sooner in the process. During the investigation of that complaint, Mr Stanley said in a statement on Monday that he raised “serious matters” with the panel investigating the allegation on September 11th, and that “the party should have referred it to the Gardaí.” In a statement on Monday evening, Sinn Féin said that during the inquiry “a number of issues of concern were raised including one by Brian Stanley”. “He was advised to go to the Gardaí to report this matter but chose not to. He was accompanied by his barrister and solicitor and was fully advised of his rights and entitlements,” the statement said. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said the controversy raised “really serious questions that cut to the leadership approach of a party that is still aspiring to lead a Government”. Speaking on Monday at the opening of a new unit at the Mater hospital in Dublin, he said they raised questions about Ms McDonald’s leadership approach in the party who he was still aspiring to be Taoiseach. “Two very important questions have emerged from the different revelations across this morning. Firstly, the question should be posed to the leader of Sinn Féin, how is it you can be in an environment in which you become aware of a complaint against a very senior member of your party, somebody who is chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee, but you don’t know what that complaint itself is?” said Mr Donohoe. “That leads us to ask the question, did she not ask? And if not, why not? And if she did ask but didn’t get an answer, why did that happen?” In a statement issued through his solicitor, Mr Stanley said he welcomed the fact that “Sinn Féin has belatedly referred the ‘complaint’ and matters concerning it to the gardaí”. He said this approach had been advocated by him “for some time, including to a senior Sinn Féin official”. He said the matter should have been referred to gardaí “once both myself and my legal representative brought certain serious matters to the attention of the ‘panel’ on September 11th”. He said Ms McDonald had “stated correctly that the complaint made against me is not of a criminal nature”. However, he said that “statements by the party leadership now asserting that my rights were protected throughout this process are totally incorrect”. He said he refuted the complaint, which he said had been lodged on July 26th, the day that the nomination process opened for members to put themselves forward to contest the general election. “In my case this had the effect of preventing me of having a hope of contesting it as a Sinn Féin candidate for Laois,” he said, adding that he had “obtained written proof” from Sinn Féin of the date when the complaint was made. He claimed Ms McDonald had “given wrong information by stating that it was only received on the 2nd of August”. He said he made Ms McDonald aware of the complaint in person on July 29th “and that certain information regarding it had been circulated by party members”. “The information had been deliberately kept from me that there was a complaint or the nature of it,” he said, adding that he had to get his solicitor to write to the party on July 31st to ascertain “what was the nature of the complaint”. He said “an ‘omerto’ [sic] was in place.” Mr Stanley added: “In the intervening period, ie from July 26th, the process of character assassination was well underway by a certain party clique and has continued unabated since then. “These facts and others mean that there has been a significant abuse of process and when it was brought to the attention of the Sinn Féin ‘panel’ it was simply brushed aside,” he said. “I stand over what I stated two days ago regarding what the party refer to as an ‘inquiry’.” Speaking on RTÉ‘s Morning Ireland on Monday, Ms McDonald said a complaint was made against Mr Stanley on August 2nd by a long-standing member of the party. She said a disciplinary panel was set up, headed by a barrister who is a party member and two other senior party members, one from the South and the other from the North of the country. She said a counter allegation was made following the initial complaint, and that a preliminary report was circulated to both parties at the beginning of October. She said the internal party process had been suspended as Mr Stanley “walked away”, resigning from the party at the weekend – which was “of his doing, not mine”. The Dublin Central TD said it was at this point she was personally briefed about the nature of the initial complaint and was party to the decision of referring the matter to An Garda Síochána on Sunday afternoon. “The referral to An Garda Síochána was made in an abundance of caution because I was not happy nor would I be happy with the party left with a serious complaint and a serious counter allegation,” she said. Ms McDonald added that to her knowledge the complainant had not gone to gardaí but that was “absolutely their prerogative” and both parties were free to do so if they wished. The Sinn Féin leader also said she was not in a position to say whether or not the complaint or the counter allegation “meet the standard for criminal investigation”. Ms McDonald also insisted her party was more than fit for government and has procedures in place that work and hold people to account. On the question of her leadership, Ms McDonald said: “I lead from the front and I will not be deterred. She said she was “very much” in charge of Sinn Féin and the person “with whom the buck does stop”. As chairman of the powerful Public Accounts Committee, Mr Stanley was a one of the party’s best-known TDs, and was especially prominent during the committee’s hearings into the RTÉ scandals last year. Sinn Féin sources said they would quickly seek to remove him as chairman of the committee. His statement of resignation was scathing about the inquiry process. “In recent months a certain clique within the party have gone to extreme lengths to damage my reputation and character. No efforts have been spared by them in this regard,” he said. “On foot of a ‘complaint’ I was recently brought before an internal party ‘inquiry’. “Given what has transpired and the work of my legal team, what is very clear is this process lacked objectivity, was seriously flawed and was devoid of impartiality. “This ‘inquiry’ has been shown to have lacked any shred of credibility, not least due to a significant abuse of process. In many ways it resembled a type of kangaroo court. Legal examination of this matter will continue.” Mr Stanley said that “after 40 years of service to Sinn Féin, I will now continue working as an Independent republican TD of behalf of constituents, who have always treated me in a fair and respectful manner”.",0,1
2024/10/15,"What is the Occupied Territories Bill, why did it stall and can it be revived now? Proposed legislation introduced by Senator Frances Black long before current wars in Gaza and Lebanon began There have been calls for the Occupied Territories Bill to be passed in response to the war in Gaza. But what is it? Why did it stall? And can it be revived now? The proposed legislation – the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 – was introduced by Independent Senator Frances Black long before the current wars in Gaza and Lebanon. It is aimed at banning trade between Ireland and Israel’s illegal settlements in Occupied Palestinian Territories. While the Bill passed various stages in the Oireachtas, it has stalled at committee stage in the Dáil since 2020. Previous attorneys general had advised that the Bill was contrary to European Union trade law. However, there has been pressure from the Opposition and from within the Coalition for it to be reassessed. It is seen as a potential action Ireland could take in response to the huge loss of life suffered by the Palestinian people – more than 42,000 of whom have died as a result of Israel’s year-long war in Gaza, which was sparked by the Hamas-led attack on Israel last October. The Government has pointed to an advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as creating a “new context” to examine the issue. The UN’s top court ruled in July that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are in breach of international law and that Israel’s occupation of those territories amounts to long-term annexation which has undermined the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. These were the main findings of a non-binding advisory opinion issued by the ICJ. Taoiseach Simon Harris asked Attorney General Rossa Fanning to examine the Bill again following the ICJ’s opinion. Perhaps, in some form at least. The three Coalition leaders were briefed by Mr Fanning on Monday evening and his advice is to go to Cabinet next week. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said on Tuesday that the ICJ’s opinion “puts obligations on member states not to do anything that would support the illegal occupation of Palestine”. He said that offers a “clearer way forward” though there are “still challenges and the existing Bill would need to be redrafted and amended very substantively”. He also said “definitely the ICJ changes the context in which one can proceed now”. Mr Harris has said he wants to see the current Government “make progress” on the matter. He also said “every country must use every lever at its disposal to bring about a ceasefire in the Middle East, to end the humanitarian catastrophe”. There has been division at European Union level in terms of the approach to the war in Gaza. Mr Harris’s message to other leaders at a summit this week will be “we’re not going to wait for everyone in Europe to develop a consensus on this. If there’s more Ireland can do, Ireland will absolutely not be found wanting”. Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman said it is his party’s position that Ireland should not be trading with Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories and “we want to see that position advanced in the remaining lifetime of this Government”. Very little economically, in all honesty, but it would be a big political statement. The instigator of the Bill, Ms Black, said on Tuesday that it would only impact around €1 million in trade and “it’s not going to end the occupation on its own”. “It’s about saying that Ireland will no longer support this horrific injustice that’s happening,” she told RTÉ radio. She said she believed there will be a general election before Christmas, but she hoped it could be passed “very quickly in whatever new government is going to be formed in the new year or whenever that is”.",0,1
2024/10/16,"Will Sinn Féin lose a seat in Laois, and will Brian Stanley retain it as an independent republican? The senior TD may run against his former party, who have no obvious candidate to replace him Brian Stanley’s resignation from Sinn Féin has left the party with a dilemma on who it will run in Laois in the looming general election. As an incumbent TD that chaired the high-profile Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Mr Stanley would have been well placed to retain the seat for Sinn Féin before he fell out with the party over its handling of a complaint against him. He has said he will continue working as an “independent republican TD” on behalf of constituents and told RTÉ he intends to seek reelection. However, his efforts to retain his seat are unlikely to be made easier by the current controversy. There appears to be no obvious candidate to run for Sinn Féin and its chances of returning a TD – in what is now a tight three-seat constituency after last year’s boundary redraw – has been made more difficult with Mr Stanley’s departure. Sinn Féin is yet to set a date for the selection convention. It has just one elected representative in the county: Mr Stanley’s wife, Caroline Dwane Stanley. She has not made her own intentions known publicly on whether she intends to stay in Sinn Féin amid her husband’s dispute with the party. Ms Dwane Stanley did not respond to attempts by The Irish Times to contact her. Helen Campion, an unsuccessful Sinn Féin candidate in Laois in the local elections in June, has said she herself will not be running but added: “There’s a number of really good people here we have to talk to.” She did not offer the names of any potential candidates but said there had been “a good safe seat” in Laois for Sinn Féin and the party would “regroup” in the constituency in the wake of Mr Stanley’s departure. Ms Campion denied the local party was in disarray saying: “It’s being projected like it’s a big crisis here and it’s not really.” Sinn Féin had seven candidates in Laois running in the local election in June, but Ms Dwane Stanley and another councillor, Aiden Mullins, were the only ones to win seats. Mr Mullins resigned from Sinn Féin in August after the party notified him that he was to be suspended for three months following a complaint that was made about him. He had clashed with the party over his social media comments on immigration and he said the complaint related to his sharing of a post on trans athletes. Mr Mullins rejected the findings of the Sinn Féin investigation into the complaint about him and said: “My quotes are still up there ... so people can make their own minds up.” He said of his former party’s current woes in Laois: “They’re going to have to rebuild from the bottom up again and it’s going to be a very difficult task but there’s some great people still left there.”",0,1
2024/10/17,"EU deportation hubs not the same as ‘stupid’ UK Rwanda policy, Simon Harris says Taoiseach says Ireland has ‘open mind’ to idea for EU deportation sites for failed asylum seekers A proposal that the European Union would outsource elements of its asylum policy to countries beyond its borders was not the same as Britain’s “stupid” Rwanda policy, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. The leaders of the 27 EU countries are meeting in Brussels for a summit which will debate plans to further harden rules around migration and asylum, as well as discuss the war in Ukraine and the Middle East. One of the ideas being discussed is the possibility of setting up deportation “hubs” in countries outside of the EU, where asylum seekers whose claims were rejected could be sent, before they were returned to their home country. Speaking on Thursday morning, Mr Harris said it was important the proposal was not “misrepresented” and compared to the previous British government’s failed plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, “I deplored everything about the Rwanda policy, I thought it was downright stupid to be quite honest. It didn’t really work, it didn’t really result in anything happening ... In my view [it] was not in any way compatible with human rights law,” he said. “We need to be careful that bad examples don’t get conflated with what the European Union is actually trying to do here,” the Fine Gael leader said. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told leaders she would consider proposals to set up deportation sites outside of the EU, termed “return hubs”. The sites would be located in countries under agreements made with the EU, likely in exchange for significant funding, where asylum seekers could be sent after their claims were rejected in EU countries. The Rwanda plan envisaged asylum seekers who travelled to Britain from countries deemed safe, like France, being deported to the African country, where they would stay if granted asylum. “The Rwanda policy was not in any manner or means a sensible policy, nor was it compliant with human rights standards and laws. Just because that model was wrong doesn’t mean there aren’t other ways,” Mr Harris said. The Government had to keep an “open mind” on new proposals to address the pressure countries were under from migration, he said. “We are facing such a scale of challenge when it comes to migration we should of course consider innovative solutions,” he said. “However, anything that Europe does of course must be underpinned by our common European values, international law, human rights, meeting our humanitarian obligations,” he said. Irish people were compassionate but wanted to know there was a “firmness” to the country’s asylum system, he said. The idea for “return hubs” was floated by a group of 15 member states earlier this year, but no formal proposal has yet been brought forward by the European Commission, who start the EU lawmaking process. The conservative government of the Netherlands is weighing a plan to send rejected African asylum seekers to Uganda, the country’s trade and development minister said late on Wednesday. Reinette Klever unveiled the idea during a visit to the east African country, reports Reuters, but it was not immediately clear whether such a plan would be legal or feasible, or whether Uganda would be amenable to it. “We are open to any discussions,” Ugandan foreign affairs minister Jeje Odongo said in an interview with Dutch broadcaster NOS. Meanwhile, commenting on speculation he will call a general election before the end of the year, Mr Harris said he would discuss the right time to go to the polls with his Coalition colleagues “in due course”. Tánaiste Micheál Martin on Wednesday indicated that he would not object to an early election, if certain key pieces of legislation were passed in the coming weeks. Mr Harris said he would not discuss his plans for the timing of an election through the media. “I want the Government to finish the work that is under way. It is then obviously my constitutional prerogative to seek the most appropriate time,” he said.",0,1
2024/10/17,"When will the general election be called? The Government’s final business before it can go to the polls Decks nearly clear of key legislation party leaders have insisted must be seen through With the door firmly open to an early general election on foot of comments made by Tánaiste Micheál Martin to The Irish Times Inside Politics Podcast, politicians are now scouring their calendars for key dates that could hint at the timing of the election. All three party leaders have insisted on multiple occasions that there are key pieces of legislation they want to see completed before the Taoiseach potentially dissolves the Dáil. Looking at the legislative calendar, it seems the decks are nearly clear. As part of Budget 2025, the Government announced a €2.3 billion cost-of-living package that includes the double-double child benefit and a number of lump-sum payments too. The legislation that gives effect to these payment is the Social Welfare Bill. Last week, it was thought that it would take until the end of October to get this through the Oireachtas. That’s because it normally takes a month for this Bill to wind its way through the various stages of debate and discussion. But the legislation finished second stage in the Dáil in just two hours on Tuesday, while committee and remaining stages were completed in just an hour on Wednesday. Party leaders have also mentioned landmark legislation to regulate gambling, which has been promised for decades. This week, the legislation – which puts in place a Gambling Regulatory Authority to oversee the licensing and regulating of betting – was also passed by the Oireachtas Then there is the Maternity Protection Act 2004, a law that will enable women with cancer to defer their maternity leave until their treatment ends. The Irish Cancer Society has, for more than two years, run a “Leave Over Leave” campaign that finally paid dividends earlier this year when Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman pledged to address the issue. O’Gorman has made it known publicly and privately that he wants to see this legislation passed before any election is called. The Bill passed the second stage in the Dáil on Thursday, then is due before Committee and remaining stages next week. Officials are hoping to also confirm amendments in the Seanad next week, raising the possibility that it could get over the finish line by the end of next week. And that just leaves the Finance Bill, which gives effect to many Budget 2025 decisions, and which is now winding its way through the Oireachtas. The draft Dáil schedule for next week was issued on Thursday, and as of yet, there is no plan in place to push things forward. That means the next stage of consideration is still due to be committee stage on November 5th. The original plan was to have all stages of the Bill finished by December 11th. However, Mr Martin has said the party leaders would need to accelerate the consideration of the Finance Bill if a general election is to take place this year. And that bring us to now. First, the three party leaders will need to sit down and agree that an early election is what they all want. They will then need to accelerate the financial legislation through the Oireachtas. If they don’t want timelines to slip towards Christmas, they’d need to put their skates on here. Some Government sources believe that the party leaders could agree an election date next Monday night at their leaders meeting, and that they will publicly outline then exactly how they intend to get the final bits of work done. That, effectively, would be the start of the campaign. Others believe they will hold off for a week or two and push the legislation through, even though the import of doing that would be very clear to the public. In any event, the political world is now gearing up for an election date in mid to late November, or potentially early December.",0,1
2024/10/18,"Taoiseach Simon Harris to ‘engage with Coalition leaders’ before deciding on election date after O’Gorman’s comments Mr O’Gorman said he will be telling his Coalition partners, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, on Monday that November 29th is ‘the date to go’ to the polls  Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman has said his preference is for a general election on November 29th. Mr O’Gorman said he will be telling his Coalition partners, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, on Monday that November 29th is “the date to go” to the polls and that the public need clarity around the election date. “I’ve been out on the doors, even just last night, and I’m starting to get the sense people are getting a little tired of the ‘will they, won’t they’ and probably now’s the time to give some degree of certainty to the Irish people in terms of the election date,” he told reporters in west Dublin on Friday. “I’ll be meeting the Coalition leaders on Monday. What I’ll be saying to them is that I think we need to give clarity. I’ll be saying my preference is for a November election, for November 29th. I think that gives us the opportunity to get those final pieces of legislation through.” The Minister for Children also said his view was to get the election “out of the way” before Christmas and that if the Government was to go with the November 29th date, the Dáil should be dissolved in the first week of November. Mr O’Gorman said the Maternity Protection Bill, which would allow women with serious illness to defer their maternity leave, would get through the Oireachtas next week while the hate crime legislation would “probably conclude next week as well”. He said although there was still “a little bit more work” to be done it get the Finance Bill passed, “we can get those done over the next three weeks”. Mr O’Gorman also said he believed all of the Green Party’s 12 TDs would be returned to the Dáil following the general election. Responding to Mr O’Gorman’s comments this afternoon, a spokesperson for the Taoiseach said: “It is the Constitutional prerogative of the Taoiseach to call a general election. The Taoiseach has consistently stated he will engage with the coalition leaders before deciding. He has also consistently stated he will not do that through the media.” Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien, who was speaking alongside Mr O’Gorman, said he would not get into speculation around election dates and that it was “above my pay grade”. Mr O’Brien said while “everyone knows an election is within a matter of weeks or months”, he would take direction from Fianna Fáil party leader Micheál Martin as well as the two other leaders of the Coalition. He also said although the Government had significant work “left to do”, he believed it could be done in the time frame outlined by Mr O’Gorman. The Green Party leader’s comments come after Mr Martin opened the door to an early general election in recent days, signalling he would not object to it if certain key legislation was passed in the coming weeks. Mr Martin did not specify any preference though he indicated that a date in late November or early December would be possible if certain Bills currently before the Oireachtas, including the Finance Bill, were accelerated. The move comes after repeated suggestions by the Tánaiste in recent months that he favoured a 2025 election. Speaking in Brussels this week, Taoiseach Simon Harris said he will seek an “appropriate time” to call a general election to ask the public to give him a mandate, once the work of Government is done. “What I have said previously, what I say again today, is I want the Government to finish the work that is under way. It is then obviously my constitutional prerogative to seek the most appropriate time, and in my view, in the best interest for Ireland to have a general election,” he said. Speaking in Cork this afternoon, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said he agreed there was a need for clarity, but added: “This is something we can deal with next week”. However, he said he was “not going to get into specific dates”. Referring to comments he made on The Irish Times Inside Politics podcast on Wednesday, he said he had already made his position clear on the timing of the general election. He said it was important the planning and gambling bills had been passed. “The finance bill has to get done, and it has to be done properly, that’s the only issue it seems to me.” “If Roderic is anxious to get it early, obviously the Taoiseach will have a view as well, but to me the finance bill is key, that puts flesh on the bone of the budget.” Asked about the specific date, he said he had not mentioned the 29th, telling journalists: “I hope you listened to my podcast earlier in the week”. “The bottom line is you either have it at the end of November or the beginning of December,” he said, or in February. “If we get the key legislation done... the difference between December and February isn’t huge, so I never got overly excited about that.” He said he believed there would be clarity this week but that the Taoiseach would have something to say as well. Asked if Roderic O’Gorman had overstepped the mark by going ahead of him and Mr Harris, he said “Politics is politics... I’m not too excited about it.”",0,1
2024/10/19,"General election in late November or early December looking increasingly likely  Taoiseach to engage with Coalition leaders next week to consider dates for dissolution of Dáil and holding of election The leaders of the Coalition parties will discuss the timing of the general election on Monday evening with expectations growing that a date at the end of November – or possibly early December – will be chosen as polling day. November 29th was suggested on Friday by the Green Party leader, Roderic O’Gorman, much to the annoyance of Fine Gael, who pointed out it was the Taoiseach’s constitutional prerogative to call the election. A spokesman said that the Taoiseach would engage with Coalition leaders before seeking a dissolution of the Dáil and triggering an election, adding that the Taoiseach “has consistently stated he will not do that through the media” – widely seen as a rebuke to his Government colleague. While the calling of an election is the Taoiseach’s responsibility, it is the Minister for Housing, Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien, who will have responsibility for setting the date and deciding on either a three- or four-week campaign. The Coalition leaders will discuss the necessary arrangements for rushing through necessary legislation in the remaining weeks of the Dáil. The Finance Bill – which gives effect to many budget measures – will need to be pushed through while other essential legislation includes the Appropriations Bill and legislation providing a three-year budget for the Houses of the Oireachtas, which also must be passed by year end. That Bill was approved by the Government earlier this month. It includes provision for €565 million for the operation of the Oireachtas from 2025 to 2027, an increase of more than 20 per cent over the three years 2022-2024. A series of supplementary estimates – essentially top-ups to the budgets of several Government departments – must also be passed in Dáil votes. There is also a technical Bill necessary to underpin the State’s private health insurance market which must be passed before the end of the year. The Dáil sits next week and then rises for a week for the midterm break, returning on Tuesday, November 5th. Senior political sources ruled out cancelling the midterm break, meaning that all remaining Bills that are essential will have to be passed in the days after November 5th if there is to be a November 29th election. Sources say this is possible with extensive use of the guillotine – a parliamentary motion that ends the debate and requires an immediate vote. The last possible date for the dissolution of the Dáil to allow for a November 29th election is Friday, November 8th. With so much legislation to pass through the Oireachtas in such a short time, some sources think that the election date could slip into December. A senior Fianna Fáil figure suggested December 6th as a potential date, noting it was the anniversary of the signature of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Meanwhile, a senior Fine Gael figure said it was now “almost guaranteed” that the election would not be held on the 29th, due to Mr O’Gorman’s suggestion, and would not be announced next week. Other sources said that they did not expect any announcement on Monday, but that the leaders would look at the practicalities of clearing the decks for an election. Speaking in Cork on Friday afternoon, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said he agreed there was a need for clarity, adding: “This is something we can deal with next week.” However, he said he was “not going to get into specific dates”. “The bottom line is you either have it at the end of November or the beginning of December,” he said, adding that February was the other option. Asked if Mr O’Gorman had overstepped the mark by going ahead of him and Mr Harris, he said “Politics is politics… I’m not too excited about it.”",0,1
2024/10/2,"‘Major jeopardy’: Harris condemns Iran’s missile attack on Israel, calls on all parties to step back from brink Israel’s incursion into Lebanon is a breach of the UN Charter, says Taoiseach  The Irish Government has condemned the overnight missile attack by Iran on Israel with the Taoiseach describing the escalation of warfare over the past week as creating a “moment of major jeopardy” in the region. Simon Harris said that everybody needed to step back from the brink and there is a need for de-escalation and for a ceasefire. “What Iran did yesterday should be condemned by all. It is absolutely condemned by Ireland and if one of those missiles had got through [the air defence system] we would have been dealing with a horrific situation in terms of civilian loss of life in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem,” he said on Wednesday morning. He also said that Israel had contributed to the escalation of hostilities and its incursion into Lebanon was a breach of the UN Charter. “Of course, what’s happening in Gaza cannot be overlooked where there is a horrific humanitarian catastrophe, what I’ve described as a war on children. The position of Ireland, of the UN, of the EU is the need for a ceasefire and a de-escalation,” he said. Asked if president Joe Biden’s unequivocal support for Israel would affect his conversation with the US president in the White House in October, the Taoiseach said he would very clearly put forward the Irish position on the conflict. Responding to a question on challenging Mr Biden about the US policy of continuing to give arms to Israel, Mr Harris said Ireland had strong diplomatic relations with the US extending back over 100 years and that Ireland and the US were strong friends. He continued: “You also speak the truth to your friends and Ireland is never afraid to speak our view. I am not afraid of that either. We have an independent foreign policy that is very clear in relation to what should happen in the Middle East. “I have absolutely no doubt at all that the president of the United States of America is desperately trying to bring about a ceasefire.”",0,1
2024/10/20,"Fianna Fáil names director of elections ahead of key meeting between Coalition leaders on timing of vote General election: Minister for Finance Jack Chambers will direct Fianna Fáil’s national campaign Minister for Finance Jack Chambers has been appointed as Fianna Fáil’s director of elections amid growing expectations that the general election will be held as early as next month. The leaders of the three Coalition parties will discuss the timing of the election on Monday evening with expectations growing that a date at the end of November – or possibly early December – will be chosen as polling day. On Sunday the Fianna Fáil leader, Tánaiste Micheál Martin appointed Mr Chambers as the party’s director of elections. He said: “Jack demonstrated considerable organisational skills and leadership in the recent successful local elections for the party. “He has the capacity to direct this national campaign for Fianna Fáil and will be travelling the length and breadth of the country.” Mr Martin said that Fianna Fáil’s focus during the election will be focused “on addressing the future needs of the country, including the cost of living, housing, healthcare, creating safe and clean cities and towns, promoting sustainable climate policies, and ensuring a good quality of life for all.” Mr Chambers said his party is “very ambitious for the future, with strong tickets across the country”. His appointment comes in advance of tomorrow evening’s meeting between Taoiseach Simon Harris, Mr Martin and Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman. November 29th was suggested as an election date on Friday by Mr O’Gorman much to the annoyance of Fine Gael, which pointed out it was the Taoiseach’s constitutional prerogative to call the election. Although the calling of an election is the Taoiseach’s responsibility, it is the Minister for Housing, Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien, who will have responsibility for setting the date and deciding on either a three- or four-week campaign. The Coalition leaders will discuss the necessary arrangements for rushing through necessary legislation in the remaining weeks of the Dáil. The Finance Bill – which gives effect to many budget measures – will need to be pushed through while other essential legislation includes the Appropriations Bill and legislation providing a three-year budget for the Houses of the Oireachtas that also must be passed by year end. A series of supplementary estimates – essentially top-ups to the budgets of several Government departments – must also be passed in Dáil votes. There is also a technical Bill necessary to underpin the State’s private health insurance market that must be passed before the end of the year. The Dáil sits next week and then rises for a week for the midterm break, returning on Tuesday, November 5th. Senior political sources ruled out cancelling the midterm break, meaning that all remaining Bills that are essential will have to be passed in the days after November 5th if there is to be a November 29th election. This is possible with extensive use of the guillotine – a parliamentary motion that ends the debate and requires an immediate vote. The last possible date for the dissolution of the Dáil to allow for a November 29th election is Friday, November 8th. With so much legislation to pass through the Oireachtas in such a short time, some sources think the election date could slip into December.",0,1
2024/10/21,"Amnesty accuses UK of betraying victims over Troubles-era crimes Human rights group urges Government to continue fighting Legacy Act legislation Amnesty International has urged the Irish Government to “stand with victims” by continuing to pursue a case against the UK government over its controversial legislation for Troubles-era crimes. At a press conference in Belfast on Monday, the human rights organisation also accused the UK Labour government of betraying victims after it had previously committed to “repeal and replace” the Legacy Act introduced under the former Conservative government. Families who lost loved ones during the Troubles were also present and said they would not be “fobbed off again” by British politicians. The event was held after Northern Secretary Hilary Benn confirmed last Friday that the UK government intended to challenge a Court of Appeal ruling which found that core parts of the Act were unlawful. The development comes after the Irish Government lodged an interstate case against the British government over the legislation in the European Court of Human Rights last December. Within a week of Labour’s landslide election victory in July, Tánaiste Micheál Martin expressed hopes for a “friendly settlement” in the Legacy Act dispute. Amnesty’s Gráinne Teggart said on Monday that the UK government’s decision to appeal the legal ruling was “a betrayal of its commitments and “fails victims”. Ms Teggart called on Mr Benn to “scrap the Act in full”. Fiercely opposed by the North’s main political parties, the Legacy Act came into law on May 1st and ended previous methods of investigating the past and transfers responsibility for all Troubles inquiries to a new investigative body, the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR). Bereaved families, victims and certain public authorities can request the ICRIR to carry out an investigation. However, the body has been opposed by the majority of victims’ groups and lawyers representing Troubles’ victims. Martina Dillon, whose husband, Seamus, was shot dead by loyalists when he was working as a doorman outside a disco at a Dungannon hotel in 1997, has spent decades campaigning for justice. Collusion was suspected in Mr Dillon’s murder and an inquest began last year but was halted due to the legislation. The Labour government has pledged to reinstate inquests. Mrs Dillon accused the Northern Secretary of “turning his back” on victims. “I put my faith in the government. The day Labour got in I was so happy, and then to hear on Friday evening that they are taking a legal challenge against our court winnings, I’m absolutely disgusted,” she said. “A year ago the Secretary of State stood up and said he was against the Legacy Act, and now he is doing exactly the same. “We’re not going to stand for it, we’re here for an inquest and we’re not going to stop until we get one.” - Additional reporting by PA",0,1
2024/10/21,"Jackie Cahill announces he will not contest general election due to ‘personal circumstances’ Fianna Fáil TD for Tipperary since 2016 apologises for the sudden nature of his resignation  Jackie Cahill, the Fianna Fáil TD and chair of the influential Oireachtas Agricultural Committee, has announced he will not contest the general election.  The announcement on Monday night by Mr Cahill (61), a TD for Tipperary since 2016, came as a surprise as he was expected to contest the Fianna Fáil selection convention for the new constituency of Tipperary North. It is one of the last conventions to be held by Fianna Fáil and Mr Cahill was expected to win it comfortably.  In a statement, Mr Cahill apologised for the sudden nature of the resignation but pointed to the reason behind it, citing personal reasons, including “advice received”.   “After careful consideration and following advice received, I have regretfully decided not to contest the upcoming general election. “I sincerely regret the short notice of my decision, but personal circumstances dictated this. I would like to sincerely thank you for the help and support you have given to me over the years.” Mr Cahill first came to prominence in farm politics and was national president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association.  He has been a high-profile chair of the Agriculture Committee since 2020, and it has been one of the most active parliamentary committees in the Dáil. In recent months, it has examined the question of the EU’s Nitrates Directive, and its impact on Irish farming in depth.  While 18 TDs have announced they will be standing down, only a handful in Fianna Fáil have announced they will not stand. They include veteran TDs Seán Haughey of Dublin Bay North and Éamon Ó Cuív of Galway West.",0,1
2024/10/21,"Friday favoured as Coalition leaders confirm general election will be held this year Taoiseach indicates his preference for a Friday election date with November 29th mooted as possibility The three leaders of the Coalition parties agreed on Monday night that the general election would be held this year – but there was no agreement on a date, or on when the election would be called. Taoiseach Simon Harris indicated his preference for a Friday but the leaders did not formally agree a day or date. Officials were tight-lipped about Monday night’s meeting, which came after the Green leader Roderic O’Gorman’s call for a November 29th election caused significant anger in both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. A three-line statement was issued by the leaders after their meeting on Monday night, which said simply that the leaders had agreed the general election will take place in 2024, that they had agreed the “passage of the Finance Bill is the priority for the Government”, and that the committee stage of the Bill will commence on the 5th of November. Mr Harris has repeatedly reminded his Government partners that seeking a dissolution of the Dáil and prompting an election is his prerogative – though setting the actual date and deciding on whether there should be a three- or four-week campaign is formally a responsibility of the Minister for Housing and Local Government, Darragh O’Brien of Fianna Fáil. Sources said  on Monday that the exact choreography of all this would be discussed and agreed between the three leaders. But that does not appear to have happened yet. A series of Bills – including the Occupied Territories Bill, the Defamation Bill and the Mental Health Bill – are now unlikely to be completed and it will fall to the next government to progress them, or leave them lapse. However, officials have advised that other essential Bills – including the Appropriation Bill and a Bill authorising spending on the Oireachtas – will still have to be concluded before the election is called. On Monday, Minister for Finance Jack Chambers said that the he would accelerate the passage of the Finance Bill through the Oireachtas to ensure it is passed before an election. When the Bill returns to the Oireachtas – after a week off for the midterm break next week – it is likely that the Government will seek to take all its remaining stages to enable it to be passed in the Dáil that week – potentially clearing the way for an election to be called as early as that week. In normal circumstances it would take until the end of November or the beginning of December to clear all stages. “That’s clearly not going to happen,” Mr Chambers told reporters in Dublin. Mr Chambers, who is also the Fianna Fáil director of elections, said the three Government parties will be putting forward separate manifesto and there will be no electoral pact. Both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste Micheál Martin said the same thing at separate events on Monday. But both added that they expected voters may transfer between the Government parties.",0,1
2024/10/22,"Occupied Territories Bill to come before Cabinet Proposed legislation stalled in 2018 because of legal advice that concluded Bill contrary to EU trade law The Government is expected to agree on Tuesday to begin the process of drafting an Occupied Territories Bill that would ban goods or services in the State connected to unlawful Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories. Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin will seek approval for a review that could create a “legal pathway forward”. He is expected to tell ministerial colleagues that finding a solution will be difficult as any Bill would have to be in line with the Constitution and European Union law. The Bill was the brainchild of Senator Frances Black who introduced it in the Senate in 2018. But it stalled because of legal advice that concluded it was contrary to EU trade law. Attorney General Rossa Fanning has recently given fresh legal advice in light of a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in July. It concluded that Israel’s continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is unlawful and that there is a duty on all states to prevent trade or any other assistance to the settlements. The ICJ also held that the illegal occupation of those territories by settlers was tantamount to long-term annexation. The Republic co-sponsored a resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on September 18th, 2024, which seeks to implement the ICJ’s advisory opinion. Mr Martin said on Monday it was unlikely that the Bill would be drafted before the general election. “It will take some time to legislate for this in my view because the existing Bill is unconstitutional at the moment in terms of its current provisions and there are also issues around other aspects of the Bill that would need to be substantially amended,” he said. Mr Martin said he had spoken to Senator Black about this issue. “It’s a difficult challenging path and there’s no point in pretending that it isn’t,” he said. Separately, the Government will make the first formal payment of €4 billion into one of the State’s new “rainy day funds” following the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The payment into the Future Ireland Fund is the first 0.8 per cent of GDP tranche to the fund. The money derives from windfall revenue from corporation tax. With the fund securing a loan of €4 billion, there will be a total of €8 billion in it by the year-end. A separate €2 billion was transferred to the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund earlier this year. Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue will bring proposals to promote continuity of farming in the State between generations. Mr McConalgoe will tell Cabinet of his plans to boost the numbers of young people taking up a career in farming. It will centre on a new commission on generational renewal in farming, which will report back to him next year. There are increasing challenges with attracting young people into a career in farming. Only 7 per cent of farmers in the State are under 35 and more than 30 per cent are more than 65, a pattern replicated throughout the EU. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien will bring two memos to Cabinet on the defective concrete blocks remediation scheme. One will be to approve an order to add Sligo County Council to the scheme after it was approved by the Oireachtas last week. There are an estimated 200 to 300 dwellings in Sligo affected by defective concrete blocks The other memo will be to make an order to increase the overall grant scheme cap by 10 per cent from €420,000 to €462,000, along with a 10 per cent increase in ancillary grants, for accommodation costs, storage costs and essential immediate repairs.",0,1
2024/10/22,"€90 cut for unemployed people not engaging with jobs programme ‘common sense’ - Taoiseach   An unemployed person could be left with only €142 per week if they do not engage with department A plan to cut payments for unemployed people by €90 if they do not engage with the social welfare job activation programme has been described as a “common sense measure” by Taoiseach Simon Harris. The sum is just over double the €44 penalty currently in place to cut the €232 jobseekers’ payments for those not attending meetings requested by the Department of Social Protection or taking party in an employment support scheme, work experience or training. Increasing the penalty in place to €90 means the unemployed person could be left with only €142 per week if they do not engage with the department. Once a person re-engages the payment is restored. The plan to increase the penalty is included in the Social Welfare Bill which is set to be debated in the Seanad today. The Irish Independent reported that around 4,000 people had their payments reduced this year under the existing system. Speaking to reporters on his way into Cabinet, Mr Harris said the planned changes are “a common sense measure to make sure that our social welfare system is compassionate but also that people have to play ball. “This idea that if you refuse to engage with our activation services in the Department of Social Protection that that can just continue indefinitely – I don’t think anyone thinks that’s fair. “There’s often reasons somebody can’t work. That’s absolutely appropriate and fine. “There’s often people who need supporting in getting into work – no problem at all. “But if you’re refusing to engage at all that has to have an impact in terms of the amount of social welfare payment that you receive each week and Minister [for Social Protection Heather] Humphreys will bring forward those proposals.”",0,1
2024/10/24,"British-Irish traders ‘buried in bureaucracy after Brexit’ Drop in Irish SME trade with Britain ‘depressing’, British minister tells conference A significant fall in the number of Irish small and medium-sized companies trading with Britain is “a depressing commentary” on the effects of the United Kingdom quitting the European Union, a British minister has said. “In trade, geography still matters,” said Douglas Alexander, minister of state at the department for business and trade in London, following a speech to the British Irish Chamber of Commerce annual conference in Dublin. Nearly two-thirds of Irish SMEs have reduced, or stopped using British suppliers since Brexit, while more than a third have reduced, or stopped selling to British customers, according to a Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) survey. “Four out of the five largest trading partners of the United Kingdom are within the European Union. Ireland, I’m glad to say, is one of them – now the fifth-largest trading partner of the United Kingdom, about €100 billion this year, supporting 700,000 jobs,” he said. The survey’s findings are “challenge and a responsibility”, he said, because the British government led by prime minister Sir Keir Starmer wants “a reset” with European Union states, especially Ireland. The paperwork challenges that have turned off Irish SMEs are problems widely shared. “We have many British businesses regrettably in the same position who found themselves buried in bureaucracy after Brexit. “One of our challenges is finding practical means by which to support our own businesses that want to be exporting as well as supporting businesses in Ireland that want to export to the United Kingdom,” said Mr Alexander. Mr Alexander made clear that any negotiations with Brussels over a reframed London-EU relationship will not be taking place until “the early part of 2025″, since the next European Commission has yet to bed down. However, he said that the negotiations will be at the edges of the relationship, and will not involve a fundamental renegotiation of Brexit arrangements. The “red lines” created by the UK’s departure will not be upset. The fall in Irish SME trade with Britain is in stark contrast to North/South trade, which is heading towards €6 billion this year – “five times” the amount of just a few years ago, said Minister of State Thomas Byrne. Meanwhile, Stormont’s Minister for the Economy Conor Murphy said the Windsor Framework is already benefiting Northern Ireland, even if there are complaints that large investments have not yet been announced. Such deals do not “happen overnight”, he told the chamber conference. “We’re getting a lot of interest in [investments] but, organically, our exports to Europe are up 14 per cent. In Wales they’re static, in Scotland and in England they’re down. “So, there’s something different happening here where we traditionally lag behind on most of the economic indicators. We’re the people who are investing, are exporting more in to Europe,” he said.",0,1
2024/10/24,"Israel ‘must be held accountable for bombing civilians’, says Tánaiste as Irish aid to Lebanon rises to €10m Micheál Martin condemns ‘death, destruction and displacement’ in Lebanon and Gaza as he attends aid conference in Paris Tánaiste Micheál Martin has announced that Ireland is to provide an additional €5 million in humanitarian assistance to Lebanon, bringing the State’s total contribution to €10 million this year. Speaking at a conference in Paris aimed at raising aid for Beirut, Mr Martin reiterated Irish demands for an “immediate ceasefire and de-escalation across the region”, describing the “scale of the death, destruction and displacement” in Lebanon and Gaza as “completely unacceptable”. He accused Israel and militant groups Hizbullah and Hamas, of “systematically undermining international humanitarian law”, and said Israel “must be held accountable for bombing civilian populations”. “I took the opportunity to call out what’s happening,” he said. “We heard from international organisations about the destruction of healthcare facilities, of schools. Well over a million people have been displaced (in Lebanon), people who were already in a destitute condition having fled from Syria. They are now fleeing back into Syria.” He said there needed to be a renewed focus on reaching a diplomatic solution to the conflict, and that delegates had emphasised the need to strengthen the Lebanese military and the UN peacekeeping mission UNIFIL. He added that Ireland had supported such a move when it was a member of the UN Security Council. The Tánaiste said he had also drawn attention to northern Gaza, where tens of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced in recent weeks as Israeli troops intensify their offensive on the Jabalia refugee camp. Mr Martin said he was calling for Israel to allow an international delegation to access the area in order to assess the situation, which he described as “catastrophic”. The Tánaiste said he believed that the Occupied Territories Bill, which proposes banning trade between Ireland and illegal Israeli settlements, would make progress through the Dáil before the general election. But he said that “substantive” amendments would be necessary to ensure that the legislation would be robust enough to withstand legal challenge and comply with the Constitution. The conference in Paris – attended by 70 government delegations and 15 international organisations – is aiming to raise at least €500 million in humanitarian aid for Lebanon and to increase pressure for a wider ceasefire. But with the US focused on its own efforts diplomats say they expect little concrete progress to be made. Lebanon’s acting prime minister, Najib Mikati, told delegates that international support would be needed. “The storm we are currently witnessing is unlike any other because it carries the seeds of total destruction, not only for our country, but for all human values.” Hosting the conference, president Emmanuel Macron pledged to provide €100 million in fresh funding to Lebanon. He said that “massive aid” was needed to support the country.",0,1
2024/10/24,"Ethics watchdog ‘statute barred’ from investigating Paschal Donohoe’s 2016 expenses Standards in Public Office Commission was told it could not follow up on undeclared donations from the 2016 election The ethics watchdog was told too much time had passed to pursue action over more than €1,000 worth of undeclared election expenses by Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe. The Fine Gael TD had to make amendments to his electoral statements because of postering work carried out on his behalf by the businessman Michael Stone. However, it has now emerged that the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) could not follow up on undeclared donations from the 2016 election. Previously unreleased internal briefings said a prosecution under the Electoral Act could not take place more than five years after an offence was alleged to have happened. An internal briefing said: “As such, several potential offences relating to the 2016 election are statute barred.” It said, however, that similar undeclared donations from the 2020 general election – again relating to postering work by Mr Stone – could be pursued. The briefing said these could be “prosecuted on indictment” but would have to be brought through the courts and proven “beyond reasonable doubt”. A second course of action was detailed where the undeclared donations would be dealt with by way of complaint to Sipo. The briefing document said: “The Commission previously received legal advice that it could carry out a similar information-gathering exercise using implied powers to ensure constitutional procedural fairness.” It also advised there were “more limited grounds” available where Sipo could decline to investigate a complaint. This included a scenario where the subject matter “is not, in the opinion of the Commission, of sufficient gravity to warrant investigation”. Mr Donohoe was later informed by Sipo no further action would be taken and that amendment of his election returns was consistent with their approach to compliance. The briefing documents were only released by Sipo under Freedom of Information laws following an appeal to the Information Commissioner. However, they provide no significant clarity on how the decision was made not to go ahead with an action over the undeclared donations. The postering work came to light following a complaint by the journalist Liam Deegan. It led to the disclosure by Mr Donohoe that a commercial van was used during his election campaign in 2016. This was provided along with the labour of six individuals and was later said by the minister to have a value of €1,057. At the time, Mr Donohoe said: “I always hold myself to the very highest of professional standards and I profoundly regret that this matter wasn’t dealt with correctly in 2016. In light of the information that’s now available to me, I’ve taken the steps to address the issue as comprehensively as I can.” It also emerged that further undeclared work was carried out on behalf of Mr Donohoe during the 2020 general election. A Sipo briefing said: “In a statement by [businessman] Michael Stone on January 24th, 2023, he claims that he previously incorrectly informed the Minister that he had not provided any assistance regarding the 2020 general election. However, having re-examined the matter he realised this was incorrect.” A statement from Mr Donohoe and the Department of Public Expenditure said they had nothing further to add and that Sipo was “independent in the performance of its functions”.",0,1
2024/10/24,"New EirGrid chief to receive salary of €300,000 after Government agrees to raise Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe sets pay rate at €300,000 for new EirGrid CEO – €60,000 more than the Taoiseach earns The Government has signed off on a €50,000 increase for the salary of the new chief executive of EirGrid, the State company that develops, manages and operates the electricity grid in Ireland. The Irish Times understands that Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe agreed to set the new pay rate at about €300,000 per year, following representations made by Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan. This compares with the €240,000 a year salary that the Taoiseach earns. EirGrid chairman Brendan Tuohy told the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications in June that the salary of €250,000 paid to the previous chief executive was set at an “inadequate level to attract the type of candidate that we would consider the role requires, particularly if we are interested in enticing international candidates”. A process to recruit a new chief executive of EirGrid has been under way over the last few weeks. Former EirGrid chief executive Mark Foley stepped down from the role in April. A drink driving charge was dismissed against Mr Foley, of Hunters Leap, Newcastle, Co Wicklow, at Dún Laoghaire District Court on Tuesday after a judge ruled that a blood test, which showed that he was more than four times over the legal limit, was “not admissible” as evidence in the case. The case against him was dismissed over the Garda’s failure to offer him a urine test. Mr Foley was appointed to the top role at EirGrid for a seven-year term in 2018 on an annual salary of €200,000 which had been sanctioned by the Government in 2017. However, newly released official files show that Mr Ryan had in more recent times sought Government approval to increase Mr Foley’s pay. In May 2023, following a request from Mr Ryan to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr Donohoe provided sanction for a revised salary of €250,000 for the EirGrid chief executive post. The Government files provide an insight into the interaction between departments and agencies in relation to pay rates for top-level posts in commercial State agencies. Following the departure of Mr Foley in April 2024 EirGrid’s board, after discussions with an executive search company, put forward a draft role profile for the new chief executive. Mr Tuohy told the secretary general of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, Oonagh Buckley, that the company was not in a position at that point “to advertise or, indeed, offer anything other than the base salary for the chief executive’s post”. On July 17th last Mr Ryan wrote to Mr Donohoe about the EirGrid chief executive’s pay. Mr Ryan said the EirGrid board “wish to set a salary level at a rate that they believe will give the company the greatest chance of success in attracting a suitably qualified candidate”. The Minister said EirGrid played a critical role in Ireland’s electrical sector and within the Irish economy as a whole as it planned and operated the electricity transmission system in the country. EirGrid was “fundamental” to the Government’s decarbonisation and climate action targets, he said. In a briefing note for Mr Donohoe, his officials maintained that the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications had set out a number of arguments in favour of increasing the EirGrid chief executive’s pay. The note said that these included “the significant responsibilities currently being undertaken by EirGrid and, very importantly, in terms of its new role as offshore grid developer, owner and operator” as well as the “substantial expected future growth and increased complexity that that role would bring”.",0,1
2024/10/24,"Decisions on pay rates for semi-State chiefs needed from next government Government pay policy for senior management viewed as too restrictive by boards of commercial State bodies There has been a growing view within the boards of several commercial State bodies over recent years that Government pay policy for senior management is too restrictive. In submissions to an independent panel established by the Government in 2022, a host of commercial State companies sought greater freedom and flexibility in setting pay rates for their most senior executives. Some wanted the reintroduction of bonus or performance payments. The ESB, for example, argued that to attract and retain the best talent, the company must have “competitive and market-facing remuneration for everyone in the organisation including the chief executive”. Health insurer VHI said that it was experiencing “significant risk” in recruiting and retaining staff based on State remuneration restrictions when benchmarked against industry equivalents. Strict Government controls on the top-level pay in commercial State bodies have been in place for more than a decade. Performance bonuses were banned in 2011 after the economic crash. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe earlier this year asked the newly established Senior Post Remuneration Committee to examine pay for chief executives in commercial State companies as a priority. The recommendations of this group are awaited, but in recent months the Government had to address pay at EirGrid following the sudden departure of its chief executive Mark Foley in April. Newly released files show the EirGrid chairman as well as Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan made strong representations to have the salary increased for the chief executive post. Ultimately, they needed to secure sanction from Donohoe. The Government later agreed to add a further €50,000 to the €250,000 salary of the chief executive running the company that develops, manages and operates Ireland’s electricity grid. On July 17th, Ryan wrote personally to Donohoe asking that he “look favourably” on the request made by EirGrid chairman Brendan Tuohy to Ryan’s department for a higher salary for the post, pointing to the critical role the company plays in the electricity sector and its future role in development offshore wind energy. The following day Donohoe agreed to a salary of about €300,000. Pay in the commercial State sector can be a sensitive issue for Ministers, as seen in the RTÉ pay and spending controversies last year. Key decisions on top-level pay will have to be taken by the next government when the Senior Posts Remuneration Committee publishes its report, including whether bonuses should again be permitted. The submissions of company boards to the independent panel in 2022 and the representations to Donohoe over the summer show that these organisations believe existing arrangements are inadequate in the modern commercial world.",0,1
2024/10/24,"Healy-Raes stuck in a cycle of bike shed remarks – enough to make Ivana Bacik fly off the chain It’s dog eat dog for car parking spaces every Tuesday at the Oireachtas – at this rate they’ll have to tarmac Merrion Square TDs react in different ways to an impending election. It’s driven the Healy-Raes buck mad. One big symptom is an obsession with the leader of the Labour Party and her – not unreasonable – desire to have sufficient and adequate bicycle parking facilities available to the many people who cycle to work in Leinster House. Granted, not a lot of commuters who live beyond the Red Cow roundabout use push-power to get to Kildare Street of a morning. And cycling into Leaders’ Questions every day from Healy-Rae territory in Kerry would be impossible. So Ivana Bacik’s request – she is not alone among her peers in asking for this additional infrastructure – is solid proof that Them Above In Dublin have no time for the decent people of rural Ireland. Because if they did, they would tarmac the grounds of Leinster House – front and back – to allow put-upon politicians who have driven up from the country to park their cars there for free. Oh, they already have? Well, it isn’t enough. They should steamroll across in to Merrion Square as well. It’s dog eat dog for spaces every Tuesday at lunchtime when elected tribunes are rushing in to get the dinner before the first sessions of the parliamentary week. The Healy-Raes seem to believe that deputy Bacik, who represents Dublin Bay South – a verdant place where people originally from the sticks who wish they had been born a Protestant huddle together for sourdough and safety, is to blame for the most famous bike stand in Ireland. This little installation along the side wall of the National Gallery cost a jaw-dropping €335,000. Coalition politicians were as shocked as their Opposition counterparts when the figure was revealed, as the installation was the OPW’s project. Dubbed the “Gucci bike shed” by Aontú's Peadar Tóibín, the structure may not support many bikes but it is excellently supporting passionate speeches from Opposition candidates attacking Government waste and will provide a strong backbone for countless election leaflets when the campaign begins. Michael and Danny Healy-Rae have been gunning for the Labour leader because she wanted a proper bicycle stand on both the Merrion Street and Kildare Street sides of the building. No matter what issue Ivana Bacik raises in the Dáil and no matter how serious it might be, if there is a Healy-Rae present, chances are there will be remarks about bicycles. Wednesday was no different, with Danny already spoiling for a scene before deputy Bacik rose to her feet like a red rag to a Rural Independent bull. During an earlier Labour motion on staffing levels in the health service, the brothers expressed their solidarity with healthcare workers protesting over staff shortages at University Hospital Kerry. It was a shame this had to happen, said Danny, blaming the man sitting opposite him, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. “He’s the worst cog in the Government’s wheel.” A view solidly endorsed by his fellow Rural Independent Michael Collins, who said the health service in west Cork is every bit as bad as it is in neighbouring Kerry. Perhaps it was all too much for Stephen Donnelly, who left the chamber for a time, leaving mild-mannered Minister of State for Health Colm Burke to hold the fort. Fine Gael’s Michael Ring was also on substitute duty, in the Chair. He called on the next speaker, Donegal’s Thomas Pringle. Cue huffing and puffing from the Danny direction. “Where is the Minister gone? What’s the good in coming in here if ...” Michael tried to cut him off. Good luck with that. “Deputy Healy-Rae, you’ve had your time now. You’ve had your time.” DHR didn’t think so. “I’m asking. Where is he gone?” “He’s over there,” said the Chair, pointing to the Government benches where Colm was sitting, bespectacled and earnest. He might as well have been invisible. “I am asking where is he gone?” repeated Danny, highly agitated. Michael flung his arm out towards Colm again. “He’s over here.” “He’s not the Minister.” The Ringer was getting thick now. “He is the Minister. Yes he is. And don’t be so disrespectful. He is a Minister.” More huffing and puffing and spluttering from Danny. “He’s a Minister! And don’t be disrespectful!” The spluttering intensified. “He’s not here!” One Ringer arm was shooting out to point at Colm – meekly sitting in silence, while the other arm was flying out to hush Danny, still howling and harrumphing for Kerry. “Sit down now.” He called again on Thomas Pringle. But Danny wouldn’t shut up. Ivana Bacik could have told him that. “Don’t be so disrespectful now to a Minister,” quivered Michael. Then Michael Collins, out of the blue, shouts, “What about Bere Island and Cape Clear?” while Danny, now highly affronted, roars: “I’m never disrespectful to anyone ...” “Don’t. He’s a Minister,” repeated the Chair, standing up for the serenely smiling Colm Burke. Perhaps this made Danny reconsider. He calmed down and clarified his position. “I’ve no respect for that man who isn’t here inside today.” And whose name he couldn’t bring himself to mention. It wasn’t long, though, before election fever gripped the Healy-Raes again. It was Ivana Bacik’s turn at Leaders’ Questions so they just couldn’t help themselves. She wanted to talk about staff shortages in schools, where subjects are being taken off the curriculum in some cases and, “shockingly”, unqualified staff are being recruited just to keep classrooms open. This is causing big problems for children and their families while new and junior teachers are trying to cope with difficult working conditions and the high cost of living. “We need a commitment to address these issues. We in the Labour Party are calling for a taskforce to address this crisis. What is the Government putting in place now to stem the exodus of teachers from our schools?” Michael Healy-Rae, understanding the need to act constructively, was quick with his response. “She’s not looking for a second bike shed any more.” This time the Ceann Comhairle was in the Chair. “Please. Pleeeze,” he groaned as the smirking Healy-Raes were revving up. Ivana snapped. “Oh, shut up!” That’s not like her. Although if shouting “shut up” at the Healy-Raes was a criminal offence she would be cleared on grounds of provocation and proper order. “She gave up on the second bike shed,” sniggered MHR. A chuckling DHR chimed in. “She’s not very good at building anything.” The Ceann rolled his eyes. “We’ve had enough of the Waldorf and Statler.” Wasting his time. Ivana gathered herself during the Taoiseach’s reply. “A Cheann Comhairle, I apologise for my language earlier but I am sick of taking insults on cycling and abuse on cycling from deputies who believe that God above is in charge of the weather and have no record of taking climate change seriously. I have no time for that nonsense.” Danny started up again. The Ceann told him to stop bickering. “But she referred to me,” he whinged. Oh, shut up.",0,1
2024/10/26,"General election 2024: What’s the most likely date and could it clash with the Late Late Toy Show? We know we’re going to the polls this year, possibly on a Friday. The big question is, will the election clash with the Late Late Toy Show? Er, not exactly. What we did, finally, learn this week is that Taoiseach Simon Harris will call an election, to take place this year. The Government could have continued right up to March 2025 but he has decided to go to the country within weeks. The precise date is yet to be revealed. The Fianna Fáil/Fine Gael/Green Party Coalition announced the final Budget of its term in office earlier this month. Once the legislation gets over the line to bring in the welfare increases and tax measures, the last major business of the current Government is done. There has been speculation about an early general election since at least June – when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael did better than expected in the local authority and European elections and Sinn Féin did worse. Simon Harris taking over as Fine Gael leader and his party’s rise in support in opinion polls, and Sinn Féin’s drop, have not lessened the clamour within his party for an early election. Nor has the fact that Budget goodies in the form of double welfare payments such as child benefit will be made in the coming weeks. Yes. Both Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are deep into election preparations themselves. Within the last two weeks Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin opened the door to an early election during an interview with The Irish Times Inside Politics podcast. Green leader Roderic O’Gorman later suggested Friday November 29th as a possible election date, prompting annoyance within Fine Gael, given that it is the Taoiseach’s constitutional prerogative to call the election. The three leaders met on Monday and agreed the election will happen this year. That would see election campaigns – already ramping up – go full throttle. The Coalition does not necessarily want a lengthy campaign. There is still some business the Government has to do, like passing the Finance Bill. This will be accelerated but it could still take one or two weeks from November 5th, when it is due back in the Oireachtas. An election in late November is considered most likely – either the 22nd or the 29th. December 6th – the night RTÉ broadcasts the Late Late Toy Show is – considered less likely. Not so much. “I like elections on a Friday,” he told reporters before heading into a Cabinet meeting. He’s going to keep everyone guessing for a little while yet.",0,1
2024/10/26,"Childcare reform set to form major plank of FG manifesto, Harris indicates  Taoiseach says no parent would pay more than €200 per child per month for care if his party re-elected Taoiseach Simon Harris has signalled that reform of Ireland’s childcare sector is set to form a major plank of his party’s general election manifesto and promised to detail how costs will fall while places will increase in the days ahead. On Friday Mr Harris said he would make a reduction in childcare costs an urgent priority if returned to office following the impending election and promised to outline when and how costs are likely to fall before the end of his first 100 days in office. Speaking at a Macra na Feirme event in Naas, Co Kildare, on Saturday he repeated his commitment to reform the sector and promised that no parent would have to pay more than €200 per child per month for care if his party was re-elected. He said although some progress had been made on making childcare more affordable for parents, costs “are still too high for far too many”. While childcare costs have fallen by between 30 and 50 per cent in recent years, many families struggle to find places for their infant children with even greater challenges facing parents looking for after-school care once their children start in primary school. Mr Harris said Fine Gael would “need to show people in the weeks ahead what the next steps look like” and he promised that the party’s election manifesto would “detail very clearly the journey we believe we can take on childcare”. He said in addition to a commitment that parents should not have to pay more than €200 a month per child his party’s soon-to-be published election manifesto would detail further proposals “as to how I’d also like to reform the system”. He noted that in “some areas of the country there’s a clear lack of provision [and] many parents say to me that it is great to reduce the fees but [they] can’t get a place”. He told reporters that two years of free preschool that are now available under the so called ECCE scheme have “been transformational” but added he is mindful of the fact that not every child is able to avail of it and “there could be issues around access underpinning it”. He suggested that when building new primary schools “surely it makes sense to build new childcare facilities beside them” and stressed that while “the fees element is one part of the proposal and a very significant part for parents in a cost-of-living crisis it is just one part and we’ll be detailing more reforms that I want to see on childcare.”",0,1
2024/10/26,"Sinn Féin internal inquiry made draft finding of sexual harassment against TD Brian Stanley Draft inquiry report found that parts of the politician’s evidence were ‘not credible’ and that a young woman’s account of incident in Dublin hotel was ‘essentially true’ An internal Sinn Féin inquiry into a complaint against Laois-Offaly TD Brian Stanley was preparing to make a finding against him of gross misconduct on grounds of sexual harassment when he resigned from the party a fortnight ago, internal party documents show. Mr Stanley and the young woman who made the complaint were told that after an inquiry, which heard testimony from both sides, the party intended to make a finding that she had been telling the truth and parts of his evidence were “not credible”, according to a draft report of the inquiry seen by The Irish Times. They were given seven days to respond to the proposed findings. After five days Mr Stanley resigned from the party claiming he had been subjected to a “kangaroo court” and there was a “clique within the party [which] have gone to extreme lengths to damage my reputation and character”. On Friday, in a statement to The Irish Times in response to detailed queries about the inquiry, Mr Stanley’s solicitor repeated his “strenuous denial of any wrongdoing”. The report “is, in fact, a draft report, not a final report”, and Mr Stanley contests the “provisional findings”, the statement said. Mr Stanley’s solicitor said the complaint against the TD was “solely and exclusively politically motivated”, and that it was made before the general election and the selection of candidates. The Sinn Féin disciplinary process was “demonstrably abused throughout”, the statement said. The inquiry by the party began in August after the woman made a complaint about an incident at a Dublin hotel on Wednesday, October 11th, 2023, after the woman had travelled to meet Mr Stanley. She had previously worked for Sinn Féin several years ago, and was seeking advice on applying for employment in the EU. At Mr Stanley’s invitation they ate together at Leinster House and had drinks at a pub. The Sinn Féin inquiry repeatedly found aspects of Mr Stanley’s evidence to be not credible and ultimately said that “taking all the available evidence into consideration, that on the balance of probability that narrative as put forward by the complainant is essentially true”, the draft report states. The woman said she was upset and traumatised in the days following the incident, and communicated with Mr Stanley by text message. The texts were presented as evidence to the inquiry, which it said in the draft report were “not disputed”. She sent him a request for €60,000 to compensate her for what she claimed happened on the night, text messages show. The woman now says that her request for money was an “unwise, idiotic, and ill-judged decision while in a state of shock and powerlessness”. The woman told The Irish Times that she never pursued the request and instead spoke to a helpline and to people close to her to help deal with the emotional toll of the incident. Mr Stanley, in his evidence to the inquiry, strongly disputed the version of events presented by the woman, and says that she is involved with others in the party in a conspiracy to remove him. He repeated this in his statement via his solicitor to The Irish Times, saying that “the complaint was wilfully withheld for a period of almost 10 months in an effort to spancel our client’s potential political candidacy”. Mr Stanley told the inquiry he believed there was an organised effort to remove him and that the complaint was part of that. When he resigned the party rejected Mr Stanley’s claims, and said the internal inquiry was at an end because of his resignation. It also said it had passed on to the Garda the allegations against Mr Stanley as well as a counter-allegation – about the demand for money – he made against the woman. But after speaking to gardaí this week, the woman – who did not want to be identified – told The Irish Times that the Garda did not have the full party dossier on her case nor the party’s draft inquiry report that found against Mr Stanley. The woman is now highly critical of the party’s handling of the process, saying it “totally and utterly” betrayed her trust in its handling of the affair. In a statement to The Irish Times on Friday the woman said: “This is not about politics. This is about justice, safety, and working to ensure that no other woman goes through a similar experience. I am speaking out to protect others, to bring what happened to light, and to seek accountability where it is due.” In his statement Mr Stanley’s solicitor said: “It has been a source of extreme distress to our client and his family (whose ongoing support is greatly valued by him), that his lifelong service to Sinn Féin and the people of Laois (and Offaly) has been demeaned in this way at this stage of his political career.”",0,1
2024/10/28,"Brian Stanley’s account to inquiry in direct conflict with woman’s version of events The woman involved first sought the Sinn Féin TD’s advice on applying for jobs in the EU, draft report shows Further details have emerged shedding light on the controversy that led to Brian Stanley, the Laois-Offaly TD, resigning from Sinn Féin. As first revealed by The Irish Times on Saturday, a complaint made by a woman over a meeting with Mr Stanley in Dublin on the night of October 11th, 2023, led an internal Sinn Féin inquiry to conclude in a draft report that the TD’s conduct on the night constituted “sexual harassment”. The draft 18-page report – seen by this newspaper – states that this amounted to “gross misconduct” and that it breached Sinn Féin’s ethics and party discipline guidelines. Before the party’s seven-day deadline for Mr Stanley to comment on the draft report had been reached, Mr Stanley – on the night of Saturday, October 12th, last – issued a public statement resigning from the party. The TD, once a senior figure within Sinn Féin who has since been replaced by the party as chairman of the powerful Public Accounts Committee, strongly criticised the internal party inquiry and its work. Further information can now be revealed around what the inquiry discovered about what happened on that night and how, in some aspects, the accounts of the woman and Mr Stanley to the inquiry are in direct conflict. The woman at the centre of the controversy first became acquainted with the now former Sinn Féin TD about a decade ago through voluntary work with the party. She worked for the party for a period in 2016 and 2017 but her employment ended after a probationary period. Internal party documents show Mr Stanley suggested to the inquiry that the woman’s unhappiness at how the party treated her was relevant to its work but she insisted there was no issue and it happened years earlier. Last year the woman sought Mr Stanley’s advice on applying for jobs in the EU. She claimed in evidence to the inquiry in the run-up to her October 2023 meeting that he phoned her repeatedly, though her account was strongly denied by Mr Stanley. Initially, she suggested a coffee in Portlaoise, but Mr Stanley insisted that the meeting should happen in Leinster House in the evening, she claimed in evidence to the inquiry. Mr Stanley told the inquiry that the young woman told him it suited her to come to Dublin to meet him. She denied this, claiming that the Dublin meeting was at his insistence. A meeting was arranged for the evening of Wednesday, October 11th, 2023. Early that evening, the woman texted Mr Stanley to say there were storm warnings and they should perhaps postpone the meeting. She claimed to the inquiry that he phoned her repeatedly assuring her that she should come. He claimed in evidence to the inquiry that he agreed to the meeting “reluctantly”; she claimed that she felt constant pressure to travel up to Dublin to meet him. She claimed to the inquiry that Mr Stanley had told her he had booked a room for her; he strongly denies this in his testimony to the inquiry. When she arrived in Dublin, Mr Stanley met her outside Leinster House and drove her car into the car park. They had dinner in the Leinster House canteen, each having a glass of wine. Afterwards they went to a nearby pub, where they had two more drinks – the woman claims that she felt pressured to drink, but Mr Stanley denies this – and thereafter to the hotel the TD was staying in nearby. He told the inquiry that the woman was wondering where she would stay or if she should go home (she lives outside Dublin). He told her that he had booked a room for himself and she could “kip up there” – as he had expected there would be two beds, a double and a single, in his room. The woman claimed to the inquiry that she had been assured by Mr Stanley that he had booked a room for her; he denied this. He told the inquiry he was surprised there was only one bed in the room; she said she was shocked that there was only one room and one bed, but felt she could not go anywhere else. Mr Stanley claimed in evidence to the inquiry that he slept on the floor; the woman claimed he did not. There is no suggestion of any physical engagement or anything of an illegal nature. However, the woman told the inquiry she was deeply traumatised and upset by what had happened. Mr Stanley claimed that she became “irate and annoyed” the following morning when he did not want to discuss the circumstances of her departure from her role in Sinn Féin six years earlier – something that the woman strongly denied. The woman told the inquiry that she was upset and traumatised in the days following the incident. She communicated with Mr Stanley by text message on the Friday morning to express her feelings – and to send him a request for €60,000 to compensate her. Text messages given to the inquiry show she told Mr Stanley that she deserved “compensation” for the “emotional trauma” he put her through on the Wednesday night and demanded that if he left €60,000 in cash divided in six envelopes in her letter box she “will not pursue things further”. Mr Stanley replied in a text: “God [name redacted]. You know I would never do anything wrong on you. I never would never ever do that. And for me it’s just friendship. That is all we always had a good working relationship. Please this as been [sic] totally honest.” The woman responded: “I have nothing else to say. I will consider not sharing what happened as long as you compensate for the emotional damage. Do not contact me again.” He apologised in a further text, saying: “I sorry [sic] if I caused that but god [name redacted] you know me long enough to know that I’m genuine. And I’m really sorry and I mean that. Please accept that [name redacted].” The woman now says that her request for money was an “unwise, idiotic and ill-judged decision while in a state of shock and powerlessness”. She said she never pursued the request for money and instead spoke to a helpline and to people close to her to help deal with the emotional toll of the incident. Mr Stanley strongly disputed the woman’s version of events and claimed that there was a conspiracy in the party to remove him. But the party’s inquiry found in its draft report that Mr Stanley’s responses to her request for money were not consistent with his version of events. The inquiry concluded in its draft findings that he sent her texts that apologised and did not dispute that something had happened. The inquiry found that the text exchanges suggested that she was telling the truth and were crucial to its decision. It found that he was acknowledging that something had happened and was apologising for it, rather than denying any impropriety and wondering why he was being asked for money. Referring to the messages exchanged between the woman and Mr Stanley, the inquiry found in the draft report that “any reasonable assessment lends credence to the complainant’s narrative of events. The threads speak to a complainant that is adamant that something serious happened and a respondent who is apologetic until the last text ... “At no point does the respondent [Mr Stanley] refute that something serious happened or question what the complainant is referring to [as might be expected if the respondent’s narrative of events is true]. “All of which, in the panel’s view, lends credence to the complainant and not the respondent.” In a small number of other respects, the inquiry also found Mr Stanley’s evidence to be “not credible”. Having heard evidence from both sides, the three-person Sinn Féin inquiry team reached its preliminary conclusions on October 5th, and wrote to both parties with a copy of its draft report. It found that “taking all the available evidence into consideration, that on the balance of probability that narrative as put forward by the complainant is essentially true”. It concluded that his conduct “constituted a breach of the Sinn Féin Charter of Ethics”, in that his conduct constituted “sexual harassment” and, as such, “gross misconduct”. Each side was given seven days to make any comment or submission on the proposed findings in the draft report. After five days, Mr Stanley issued a statement that was highly critical of the inquiry, and announced his resignation from the party. “Given what has transpired and the work of my legal team, what is very clear is this process lacked objectivity, was seriously flawed and was devoid of impartiality,” he said in a statement issued through his solicitors. “This ‘inquiry’ has been shown to have lacked any shred of credibility, not least due to a significant abuse of process. In many ways it resembled a type of kangaroo court. Legal examination of this matter will continue.” He said he would continue to represent the people of Laois as an “Independent republican”. Mr Stanley’s resignation from the party meant that the inquiry process was at an end. The party referred matters to the Garda following his resignation. In response to detailed questions from The Irish Times on Friday, his solicitors issued a further statement. They were especially critical of the leaking of the draft inquiry report, and pointed out that it was a “draft report, not a final report”. “Its provisional findings, adverse to our client, are denied fully and our client continues to assert that they are not supported by the evidence presented to the panel conducting the inquiry. “We repeat our client’s strenuous denial of any wrongdoing on his part,” Mr Stanley’s solicitors said. They went on to say that the Sinn Féin disciplinary processes “have been demonstrably abused throughout”. This weekend, the woman at the centre of the complaint, who spoke to The Irish Times last week, also spoke to a number of other media outlets. She has been highly critical of Sinn Féin’s handling of the process, saying that the party was trying to protect itself, rather than stand up for her. On Sunday, Sinn Féin said in response to queries from The Irish Times that it “does not comment on the details of internal party inquiries. These matters are now with the gardaí.” As the general election looms ever closer, the controversy seems likely to continue.",0,1
2024/10/29,"‘Stop this horror of history,’ says President Higgins as Israel moves to ban aid agency Taoiseach Simon Harris says Europe needs  to find the ‘moral courage’ to act on the issue President Michael D Higgins has said it is “time to stop this horror of history” after Israeli legislators passed laws that could threaten the work of the main UN agency providing aid in Gaza. Mr Higgins called on all EU and UN member states to make “clear” their support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unwra) and repeated his calls for a ceasefire and for the hostages to be released. The Irish Government has raised strong concerns about what Israel’s efforts to sever ties will mean for the already limited flow of aid to civilians in the Palestinian enclave. “100,000 people in northern Gaza, the majority women and children, are effectively trapped with no safe place to go to. Two of their three hospitals are destroyed and one is under siege,” Mr Higgins said in a statement. “Older people are dragged from their hospital beds and the extraordinarily brave medical staff who have stayed with the most vulnerable are paying with their lives and the threat of arrest. “Silence from those who have had the best of aspirations for the EU and its future during a grave humanitarian catastrophe would be more than disappointing, it damages the union. “Given the circumstances of people starving to death, the placing under attack of the United Nations agency that is responsible for keeping them alive constitutes an appalling failure of diplomacy and the use of starvation as a weapon of war. “It is time to stop this horror of history. Palestine and Israel will ultimately have to live together in spaces adjacent to each other.” Ireland issued a joint statement with Spain, Norway and Slovenia condemning the vote in the Israeli parliament that would ban Unwra from operating in Israeli-controlled lands. The Knesset also voted to cut formal ties between Israel and the organisation. The moves come amid Israeli claims that Unwra maintains close ties with Hamas – allegations the agency strongly rejects. Speaking on Tuesday, Taoiseach Simon Harris said that Europe needed to find the “moral courage” to act on this issue. “More people will die, more children will starve, there is no alternative to Unwra,” the Taoiseach said. “They’re not just my words, they’re the words of the UN secretary-general, they’re the words of the president of the United States through his State Department. “Unwra is needed, it is absolutely essential and the actions we have seen in the Knesset really are absolutely shameful. “I’ll be talking to (incoming European Council president) Antonio Costa this afternoon about how Europe now needs to find the moral courage in my view to act in relation to this.” The chief executive of Irish charity Trocaire, Caoimhe de Barra, said it was “appalled” at the Israeli parliament’s decision. “Banning Unwra is a gross violation of humanitarian law as it’s deliberately inflicting even greater depravation and harm on a civilian population in the middle of a war. “This is appalling. All states must now pressure Israel to reverse this decision immediately.” - PA",0,1
2024/10/29,"Minister for Housing ‘angry’ at rogue developers but has no plans to pursue them Darragh O’Brien says it is a ‘great frustration’ that many companies to blame have folded and set back up again Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has said that he is “angry” that developers have been able to walk away from defective apartment blocks but acknowledged that the Government has no plans at present to pursue them. Mr O’Brien was speaking in Sandyford in south Dublin after meeting a group of owners of defective properties about the launch of a pilot scheme under which the Government will pay for fixing the defects. The “pathfinder” scheme, which will examine the best way to compensate owners, will include more than 1,000 properties, he said. Mr O’Brien said that there are about 100,000 properties affected across the country, with about a third remediated already. Asked if there were any efforts by the Government to make the people who actually built the defective properties pay for them, Mr O’Brien said: “I have to say I’m pretty angry – a lot of the developments, we know who built them. The statute of limitations for many of them has ran out. In many instances, companies have folded and set back up again and are building again and that’s a great frustration.” Asked if there were plans to name the developers in question, Mr O’Brien said:  “I have always been guided by what residents want first and foremost and they really need to see progress. He added: “The stress that people have been under in living with these type of horrendous defects the issues they’ve had with regard to costs, trying to fund things themselves, increased insurance costs and in some instances where there’s been threats to withdraw insurance from certain developments – that has been my main focus in trying to bring improvements in that area. “But any legal mechanism that we can use to go after those whose shoddy workmanship left residents who pay good money for their homes – I’m not closing the door on any legal options that may be available to us,” he said. He said the list included “some significant players in the construction sector”. Pressed as to whether there were any current plans to hold the developers to account, Mr O’Brien admitted: “Not right now as I talk to you today. But I’m certainly not closing the door on that.” Mr O’Brien was also asked if the Government would agree new housing targets before the election. The Government had previously said that it would adopt updated targets before the Dáil was dissolved but reports over the weekend suggested that Tánaiste Micheál Martin had blocked efforts to reach agreement. “There’s still work ongoing there,” Mr O’Brien said. “I mean everyone has a number. Really my focus is on driving the completions for this year. “I expect there will be a discussion at Cabinet tomorrow,” he added, but said: “I can’t say that a decision will be made tomorrow.” Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman said that he wanted to see a figure agreed before the election, commending the ESRI figure of about 53,000 units a year. “It’s been discussed among the party leaders over recent weeks, I’d have a preference to see them published [before the election]. I think it’s important that we set out what we hope to achieve over the next five years,” he said. “I think it’s important that they’re realistic, but also ambitious and it is about getting that balance right.” The “pathfinder” scheme for the defective apartments was welcomed by the Construction Defects Alliance, which  campaigns for the homeowners affected. “While we await the details of what the pathfinder process will involve — including its terms of reference and the timelines involved, especially for reimbursing owners — there is no doubt that Minister O’Brien’s announcement will be a source of great relief to thousands of apartment owners across the country,” campaign group chairman Pat Montague said.",0,1
2024/10/3,"‘We will finish our agreed agenda’: Martin denies having talks with Fine Gael and Greens about early election Fianna Fáil leader criticises ‘fevered speculation’ about voters potentially going to the polls in November  There have been “no discussions” between the Coalition party leaders about having an early general election, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said.  At time of what he described as “fevered speculation” about voters potentially going to the polls in November following a giveaway budget, the Fianna Fáil leader said he remains committed to passing a raft of “vital” legislation before an election – which would be almost certain to take the Coalition into next year. Mr Martin emphasised that any arrangements for the end of the Government would have to be discussed and agreed by him, Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Simon Harris, and Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman.  “At the start of the Government, and when key changes happened, the three-party leaders reaffirmed each of our commitments to a process for completing our mandate,” he said. “I can tell you equally clearly that nothing has changed. There have been no discussions about finishing our mandate early. “I have no reason to believe that anything has been changed and each of the three party leaders has publicly and repeatedly reaffirmed that all decisions about completing our term will be discussed and agreed. “This is the approach which has been central to the Government’s work for 4½ years, so there is no reason to expect that there will be any change – particularly given the vital importance of key legislation currently before the Oireachtas.” Mr Martin said that the Government needed to concentrate on passing the legislation that will complete the financing of the State “fully and properly for this year and next.” “We have to complete the most radical overhaul of planning in many decades – an absolutely fundamental requirement for accelerating home building and infrastructure development,” he said. “We have to enact vital new social legislation, especially in the area of mental health. We have to reform the libel laws to address problems which independent international bodies say are undermining press freedom. “Most of all we have to show that we can be true to our word in putting the people before politics.” In what will likely be seen as a scold of those in Government who are already campaigning, Mr Martin said: “Governing is much harder work than campaigning. It requires focus. It requires a willingness to listen, study and then act.  “What I believe are the real and sustained successes of this Government over the past 4½ years were built by our determination to put the hard work of government ahead of politics. “We will finish our agreed agenda and then, in accordance with what we have repeatedly promised the public, we will turn to offering our new priorities for a new mandate for each of our parties.”",0,1
2024/10/3,"‘I wasn’t responsible’: Former OPW minister says he learned of Oireachtas bike shed cost in media Patrick O’Donovan agrees with view of Pashcal Donohoe, who said he was ‘embarrassed’ at price paid for structure Patrick O’Donovan, the former minister of State for the Office of Public Works (OPW), has denied having any responsibility for the €336,000 spend on Leinster House bicycle shed, which he described as embarrassing. Mr Donovan, now the Minister for Higher Education, said he first learned about the project’s cost when he read it in the media. He said he learned of the €1.4 million cost of a security hut at the Department of Finance when the OPW’s John Conlon outlined it to members of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) last week. The Fine Gael TD acknowledged he was the minister of State with responsibility of the OPW at the time but insisted he had no part in decision making at that level. “I wasn’t responsible for it. I didn’t approve the money because that’s not the role of the Minister of State for the Office of Public Works. The accounting officer in the Office of Public Works is the chairman,” he told reporters in Dublin on Thursday. PAC chairman Brian Stanley on Thursday told committee members that OPW officials would appear before them later this month over the controversial spend on the bike shed. The Sinn Féin TD said “hopefully we’re still here” at that stage, hinting at a possible dissolution of the Dáil due to speculation about an early general election. Mr Stanley said the spending watchdog had invited the OPW to appear before it on October 2nd but was told this date was not suitable due to other engagements. It had instead proposed October 22nd as an alternative, which PAC members agreed to on Thursday. Earlier, Mr O’Donovan attended the Department of Further and Higher Education’s post-budget briefing and was asked repeatedly about his view of the various OPW spending controversies. He said he agreed with Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe when he said he was “embarrassed” about the sum involved. He said that as minister of State for the OPW “you don’t get detailed day by day analysis with regard to individual projects, with regard to maintenance, with regard to roofs”. “The Minister is not the accounting officer,” he said. “The Minister is not the person who signs off on expenditure with regard to the OPW, no more than the Minister signs off on individual expenditures in health, education.” In relation to the budget for his current department, Mr Donovan said the Government’s commitment to providing an additional €650 million to the higher education sector between now and 2030 would help institutions with staffing and other costs as well as course development and delivery, which would benefit students. He said a decision to tap into the surplus contained in the National Training Fund would allow for the funding of substantial initiatives in the areas of lifelong learning and work related upskilling. He outlined funding for a range of initiatives including supports for SME’s seeking to release workers for training and older workers looking to upskill. “We know substantial cohorts of our working population need to be reskilled for the workplaces of the near future.” Minister of State Niall Collins said there will be further expansion in the area of apprenticeships, which he said were becoming more popular as they became “destigmatised”. He said the work to develop apprenticeships in non-traditional areas continues but there would be an emphasis on growing the numbers of people in craft apprenticeships as part of a wider attempt to meet skills needs in the construction and related sectors. “That’s very, very important in terms of meeting our climate change and, particularly, our housing for all targets, because we have to have the pipeline of skilled workers out there.”",0,1
2024/10/3,"Minister for Health still ‘fully expects’ State to take ownership of children’s hospital next year  Stephen Donnelly says commissioning of facility accelerated and staff could move in ‘maybe before final completion date’ The Minister for Health has said he still fully expects the State to take ownership of the national children’s hospital next year despite repeated delays and doubts being cast on the project’s completion date. Speaking in the Dáil on Thursday, Stephen Donnelly said commissioning of the facility could be accelerated and staff could move in “maybe before the final completion date”. He again firmly put the blame for delays and increased costs on main contactor BAM and called on TDs to unite on the issue. Mr Donnelly highlighted a €24 million claim the developer made for a project it said would delay completion by months which was dealt with at the Public Accounts Committee (Pac) earlier this year. He said Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty first raised the issue, based on information from the developer, but work ended up costing €200,000 and completed much sooner. The Minister told fellow TDs “there is value to us speaking in one voice” and “shining the light where it belongs”. He was speaking during health questions after Sinn Féin spokesman David Cullinane challenged him on the role of the Government in the repeated delays to the hospital. Mr Cullinane said “there is a dodging of responsibility from the Government side” and that Mr Donnelly should accept the hospital board overseeing the project could go no further because of the “flaws in the contract”. He called on the Minister to state when the handover of the hospital would happen and “when it will open and treat patients”. The Waterford TD added: “And do you accept despite all of the tough talk and Government Ministers sticking their chests out and saying we’re going to take on the contractor, the reality is that we’re no closer to this hospital being built than we were this time last year?” The hospital has been dogged by controversy, successive delays and spiralling cost overruns, currently estimated at €1.5 billion and bringing the final bill to an estimated €2.2 billion. Doubt has also been cast on it being completed by next year with concern that the HSE will not be ready to transition staff in when construction is finally completed. Mr Donnelly reiterated his opinion, and that of the board overseeing the project, that BAM had missed the completion deadline 14 times. He insisted the board, acting on behalf of the Government, was using all the levers at its disposal.",0,1
2024/10/3,"Former UL president being paid €175,000 while on year-long sabbatical, PAC hears Kerstin Mey resigned as UL chief last June and is on leave in new post as professor of visual culture The former president of the University of Limerick (UL) is being paid €175,000 while out on a year-long sabbatical after taking over a professorship position that has no department or course in place. The Public Accounts Committee was told on Thursday that Kerstin Mey resigned as UL president last June and is now on sabbatical leave in her new position as professor of visual culture. UL chancellor Brigid Laffan told the committee the university does not have a Department of Culture and there is no visual culture course in place either. Ms Laffan added that Ms Mey would “not be short of things to do”. She said the role had been agreed on following a process of mediation “involving legal advice on both sides”. Ms Laffan said when an academic exercises a senior role in the university, it is “an absolute sectoral norm” that the person then has a sabbatical to “kick-start a research career and that’s what’s happening”. When asked how long was left on Ms Mey’s contract, Ms Laffan replied: “As of September 1st of this year, she has five years left, which does not bring her to full retirement age.” Two property deals conducted by UL, including the acquisition of 20 houses for student accommodation at Rhebogue in Limerick city for €11 million in August 2022 and the former Dunnes Stores site, also in the city, for €8.3 million in 2019 were raised during the hearing. UL president Prof Shane Kilcommins said the university had “significantly overpaid” for both assets, resulting in a cumulative loss of €8.27 million. Ms Laffan said she had referred both transactions to An Garda Síochána and they were due to meet them next week. The committee was also told that chief commercial officer Andrew Flaherty, understood to have been central to the purchase of the student accommodation at Rhebogue, has been placed on leave on full pay by the university pending an internal investigation into that transaction. Ms Laffan said both deals did not “occur in a vacuum” and asked how it could be that despite a change in leadership, so many of the shortcomings were repeated. Comptroller and Auditor General Séamus McCarthy said a key concern was that more than five years on, the university “remains without a clear development and funding plan” for the former Dunnes Stores site at Honan’s Quay. “We have a professor earning €175,000 for a job that does not exist. We have a site in the middle of Limerick that was bought for €5 million over the valuation that is not in use and there is no plan or finance for it. And it sits there like a white elephant,” said Public Accounts Committee chairman Brian Stanley (SF). “Out in Rhebogue, 3km from the university, we have 20 houses that were bought well in excess of double the market value of what houses were selling in the area. We could go on and on,” he added.",0,1
2024/10/3,"David Lammy becomes first British foreign secretary to visit Dublin for seven years Sparse detail of talks emerges after meeting with Micheál Martin but countries vow to deepen ‘key strategic links’ David Lammy became the first British foreign secretary to visit Dublin for seven years on Thursday when he held talks in Dublin with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin. The meeting was notable for being held at arms-length from the public, with no public engagement by the Labour politician, and without a press conference, repeating the rules insisted upon on by London during prime minister Keir Starmer’s visit in September. In a joint communique issued Thursday evening, Mr Martin and Mr Lammy said their Iveagh House meeting “provided an important opportunity to underscore the commitment to and ambition of both governments for the British-Irish relationship”. Mr Lammy was accompanied by minister of state for the constitutional European relations, Nick Thomas-Symonds, an increasingly important figure in London’s relationship with Brussels. He held separate talks with the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Carroll McNeill and is understood to have updated her on the outcome of his recent meetings with European Union officials, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday. On Anglo-Irish relations, Mr Martin and Mr Lammy said they had placed “a particular focus” on investing in connections between people living in both countries, supporting increased trade and investment, and deepening “key strategic links”. However, the level of detail released about the talks was sparse. Looking ahead to the first annual UK-Ireland Summit in March, they agreed “to intensify co-operation on foreign and security policy issues”, but, again, no detail was offered. Running through the list of current major international crises, they underlined the support of both countries for Ukraine, and emphasised “the critical importance of protecting multilateralism and international law”. “They agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, unhindered access for humanitarian aid and renewed focus on a two-State solution which is the only viable path to lasting peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians,” the communique stated. Condemning Iran’s attacks on Israel, they voiced “deep concern” about spiralling violence in the region and agreed the need for an immediate ceasefire between Hizbullah and Israel, saying a political solution is “the only way to restore stability and security”.",0,1
2024/10/3,"‘A remarkable woman’: Tributes paid to former Fianna Fáil minister Mary O’Rourke after her death Ms O’Rourke was deputy leader of party between 1994 and 2002 and became Seanad leader afterwards The former Fianna Fáil minister and deputy party leader Mary O’Rourke has died, her family has confirmed. She was 87. Ms O’Rourke served in the cabinets of Charles Haughey and later Bertie Ahern. After politics she continued to maintain a high public profile through writing and broadcasting. It is understood that Ms O’Rourke had recently been ill. A death notice posted on rip.ie she died “peacefully surrounded by her loving family and in the exceptional care of the staff of the Fern Dean nursing home, Deansgrange”.  “Mary’s family express their gratitude to everyone for your support at this difficult time,” it states. First elected for the Longford-Westmeath constituency in 1982, she was appointed minister for education by Mr Haughey in 1987.  She moved to the Department of Health in 1991 and was demoted by Albert Reynolds when he succeeded Mr Haughey, but resisted the move so fiercely that he gave her a job as a junior minister. Ms O’Rourke was restored to the party’s front bench by Mr Ahern in 1994, becoming deputy leader in opposition after Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left formed a coalition without an election. When Mr Ahern led Fianna Fáil back into power in 1997, Ms O’Rourke was made minister for public enterprise, which included supervision of many of the large semi-State companies. She presided over the privatisation of Telecom Éireann and also – because of her responsibility for Aer Lingus and the State’s airports – clashed frequently with Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary. She lost her Dáil seat in 2002 before being nominated to the Seanad by Mr Ahern, where she was subsequently appointed leader of the House. Five years later, she was back in the Dáil when the 2008 financial crash arrived. She lost her seat again in the massacre of Fianna Fáil candidates in 2011. During her career, Ms O’Rourke had a reputation for straight-talking and a facility for political street-fighting. At a time when politics – especially in Fianna Fáil – was overwhelmingly male, she stood out. She was a member of a famous Athlone political family. Her father Paddy was a Fianna Fáil TD in the 1960s and her brother Brian was also a long-standing Fianna Fáil minister in the governments of Mr Haughey. He and Ms O’Rourke served in two cabinets together, from 1987-1990. Her nephews, Brian and Conor Lenihan, were also TDs and ministers, while her son Aengus is a Fianna Fáil councillor in Westmeath. Another son, Feargal, is a former managing partner of PwC and is currently chairman of the IDA, Ireland’s foreign direct investment agency. Feargal paid tribute to her in a post on X, saying she “loved [her sons] to bits, taught us to respect everyone, to be honest, to work hard and study hard, to love our family”. In a statement, the Fianna Fáil leader and Tánaiste Micheál Martin said she was a “remarkable woman who made an outstanding contribution to Irish public life and to the modernisation of Ireland”. “Mary was a commanding and engaging figure – an insightful observer of both political life and societal trends. Her wit and keen sense of the country, both in its present state and future potential, made her a cherished colleague and friend,” he said. President Michael D Higgins said she had a “shrewd and magnetic approach to politics and politicians”. “The warmth of her personality was reflected in the wide appreciation held for Mary among both the public and her fellow members of the Oireachtas, and was respected in her continuing and wide-ranging engagement with so many parts of public life in the years following her political career,” he said. In the Dáil, Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said it had just come to his attention that “a former esteemed colleague, long serving colleague, highly regarded and colourful colleague of ours Mary O’Rourke has just passed away”. He said: “I’m sure we’d all want to be associated with expressions of sympathy to her family.” Fine Gael TD Bernard Durkan described Ms O’Rourke as “a personality” and said “she and her family made a huge contribution to public life in this country” over a long number of years. Sinn Féin TD and former Fianna Fáil member Chris Andrews also sympathised, calling Ms O’Rourke a robust and big personality. Green Party leader and Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman said in a statement that Ms O’Rourke “one of the major figures of Irish politics over the last few decades. She forged a path for female politicians and showed what was possible for those who followed.” Ms O’Rourke’s funeral will take place on Monday in Our Lady Queen of Peace Church, Coosan at noon.",0,1
2024/10/30,"Paschal Donohoe criticises toll road price increases Minister for Public Expenditure ‘reluctant’ to see anything that adds to the cost of living as TII announces 10 cent increase on M50 tolls for unregistered vehicles Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has said he does not favour an increase to road tolls. Mr Donohoe said he would be “very reluctant” to see “anything that further adds to the cost of living at the moment”. Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) recently announced there would be a 10 cent increase in tolls for cars, buses, coaches and lighter goods vehicles travelling on the M50 from January 1st that are not registered with a toll service provider. There is no increase for cars travelling on the M50 that are registered with a toll account. The Dublin Tunnel (formerly Dublin Port Tunnel) will see an increase of €1 for southbound traffic at peak morning time, meaning it rises from €12 to €13. There will also be a 10 cent increase in tolls for buses, coaches and HGVs on the eight toll roads outside of the greater Dublin region – the M1, M3, M4, M6, M7/M8, N8, N25 Waterford city bypass and the N18 Limerick tunnel. Speaking in the Dáil last week, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien called on TII and the tolling companies “not to proceed” with the planned increases and that they were “far too high”. Mr Donohoe said on Wednesday that he would agree with the Minister “in principle” but that such decisions were made independent of Government. “I do agree with the broad approach that he’s [Mr O’Brien] outlining and in recent years, particularly when inflation was at its highest, we did our best to avoid those kind of toll changes happening,” he said. The Dublin Central TD said commuters had already experienced changes in carbon taxation and increases in the price of petrol and diesel. “The [toll] changes are made independently of Government, but I think anything that further adds to the cost of living at the moment is something I’d be very reluctant to see happen,” he added. Separately, when questioned whether the Tánaiste Micheál Martin was dragging his feet on the Government publishing its revised housing targets ahead of the general election, Mr Donohoe said “not at all”. However, Mr Donohoe said he did not know whether the targets would be set out over the coming weeks. Taoiseach Simon Harris has previously said he wants the targets published ahead of going to the polls but recent reports have suggested Mr Martin has pushed back on setting them before the general election. “There is a very good engagement under way in Government in relation to it,” Mr Donohoe said. “As to whether they’ll be published in the coming days and weeks, I don’t know the answer to that question. I know we’re working in relation to it, but the really important thing is that we can point to the progress that we have made in the building of more homes.” The Minister added that his preference would be to have “a shared view” from Government on the targets.",0,1
2024/10/30,"Taoiseach will nominate chair for long-awaited Covid evaluation committee Simon Harris was speaking on way into meeting in Government Buildings Taoiseach Simon Harris will propose to Cabinet that a chair be nominated for the long-awaited Covid evaluation committee. Speaking in advance of the meeting in Government Buildings, Mr Harris confirmed that he will nominate a person today for Cabinet approval. He said the person was Irish. “It’s important we look back and look at what went well during the COVID pandemic, and also learn lessons in terms of what can go better, in terms of preparedness for future pandemics, and lessons from that very, very difficult period of time in our country,” said Mr Harris. Asked when the Covid inquiry would start, Mr Harris said the process would be started by the appointment of the char and a panel. He said that the chair would be independent and how the inquiry worked would be a matter for that persona and the panel. He said it was important to look at different models of inquiry done elsewhere. “I think the Covid evaluation is really important. I have said since the start of the pandemic, right through to now, that it’ll be really important if we look back at that period of time. Covid had such a serious impact on everybody’s lives in Ireland and somebody lives across the world, and devastating impacts for some people. “Decisions were made. They were made in real time. They were made according to the best information available to them. But even looking back now, it’s important that we look at what could have happened better, what could be done later in the future. So I think it’s a really important process, and it’s one that I supported and wanted to see happen for quite a period of time,” he said. Mr Harris also expressed his sympathy and solidarity to the people of Spain following the devastating impacts of flash floods in the east of that country, which has already resulted in over 60 deaths.",0,1
2024/10/4,"Sinn Féin failed to return Stormont security pass of ex-employee convicted of child sex offences  Former party press officer Michael McMonagle was suspended following 2021 arrest and last week pleaded guilty to multiple charges Sinn Féin failed to return the security pass which gave a former employee convicted of child sex offences access to Stormont Parliament Buildings or inform the Northern Ireland Assembly Commission of his arrest or the police investigation. It meant former Sinn Féin press officer Michael McMonagle could have retained access to Stormont until this week, more than two years after he left  the party’s employment and after he pleaded guilty to the offences. A spokesperson for the commission told The Irish Times it cancelled his Assembly pass on October 1st “in light of recent circumstances”. Last week McMonagle (42) from Limewood Street in Derry, pleaded guilty to two charges of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity, and 12 counts of attempted sexual communication with a child on dates from 2020-21. McMonagle was suspended from his job with Sinn Féin after he was arrested in August 2021 and left the party when his contract expired in June 2022. Seán Mag Uidhir, an influential Sinn Féin figure who headed the party’s media operation in the North and another press officer, Caolán McGinley, quit at the weekend after it emerged they provided references for McMonagle. First Minister Michelle O’Neill said she was “aghast and horrified” at their actions. Sinn Féin has faced strong criticism over its handling of the controversy and increasing calls to answer questions, from politicians north and south. “We need to know who knew what, when and where,” Taoiseach Simon Harris said. “I don’t think what we’ve heard to date about I didn’t know this, or I didn’t see that, is credible.” In response to questions from The Irish Times on Friday, the Assembly Commission – the body corporate of the Northern Ireland Assembly – said McMonagle was “employed by a number of Sinn Féin Members of the Assembly between May 6th to October 31st, 2014, and again between March 2nd, 2020 to July 8th, 2022″. Assembly passes “are issued as either MLA staff or party staff passes”, it said. “The pass sponsor (the party or MLA employer) should return the pass once the pass-holder leaves their employment. This did not occur in this case. “The Assembly Commission was not informed of the allegations against Michael McMonagle, or his suspension, or at any time asked to suspend or cancel Mr McMonagle’s pass. “In light of recent circumstances, the Assembly Commission cancelled Mr McMonagle’s pass on October 1st, 2024.” In response to a query from The Irish Times, Sinn Fein said: “When Micheal McMonagle’s employment was suspended his pass should have been revoked.” It is not clear whether McMonagle retained the pass or used it to access Parliament Buildings between July 8th 2022 – when the Commission said he left Sinn Féin’s employment – and the cancellation of his pass this week. “Data from the Assembly’s Visitor Management System is retained for a period of 90 days and the pass in question has not been used within that period,” the body said. It said he used a one-day visitor pass to attend the Great Hall on February 14th, 2023. Images have shown him in the vicinity of the Ms O’Neill, at the event for a six-year-old organ donation campaigner in his then role with the British Heart Foundation. Sinn Féin has been criticised for not alerting the charity about McMonagle’s arrest or the police investigation. On Friday, the North’s Minister for Justice Naomi Long asked why Sinn Féin had not done so, saying it was a “significant question that they need to reflect on whether that was appropriate or not”. The DUP leader Gavin Robinson accused Sinn Féin of “trying to shut the story down” and said the party “need to provide those answers to the satisfaction of the wider general public”.",0,1
2024/10/4,"Will Simon Harris announce a general election on the tarmac at Dublin Airport next week?  The rumours are swirling but never mind the noise: the general election campaign has already begun  At this stage, there are more theories about the timing of the general election than there are about the moon landing. The latest rumour flying around Leinster House is that when Taoiseach Simon Harris returns from meeting US president Joe Biden at the White House in a week, he will disembark the plane and dissolve the Dáil right there on the tarmac at Dublin Airport. Another theory is that he is planning to create a “committee of the Dáil” so TDs can whizz through the Finance Bill in one truncated process giving effect to the giveaway measures and hoped-for electoral benefits announced in last Tuesday’s Budget 2025 package. The only theory that no one really believes is the Taoiseach’s one: that the Government will last all the way until next March. It’s possible that Harris wants to catch everyone unawares, especially the Opposition, who seem to be getting the wind back into their sails. Strategists inside the Opposition parties have been ramping up their election planning for fear of not being ready when the whistle is blown. In Sinn Féin, some 31 selection conventions have taken place, with more planned for the coming weeks. As with other parties, these can bring their own tensions, which must be managed. In Sligo-Leitrim, for example, the party wanted to run two candidates, with outgoing TD Martin Kenny viewed from the outset as guaranteed to be re-elected. That left a contest between former North West MEP Chris MacManus and councillor Thomas Healy. Such contests can be uneasy. Before the local and European elections last June gave the party a fright, Sinn Féin would have been eyeing up three candidate strategies in many constituencies. What exactly should the scale of Sinn Féin’s ambition be? That’s the question plaguing their advisers. One source tells The Irish Times the party will run candidates in every constituency, and the final number of candidates could total somewhere in the mid-60s. That’s a far cry from aiming for a thumping majority. That can change of course: candidates can be added or taken away. Sinn Féin is still mulling a message or slogan for the general election. The theme of the 2020 general election was the need for change. Party insiders point out that the slogan of the recent ardfheis was the same as recent years: “Time for change – Am don Athrú.” As candidates are selected, leaflets and posters are being sent to printing companies and billboards are being mocked up. Expect to see specific promises on billboards in line with Sinn Féin’s housing plan that promises a “home of your own” or the promise of a childcare system costing no more than €10 a day. Asked to name the date when Sinn Féin believes the election will be held, a party source told The Irish Times: “Twenty-one days from today – and that’s the way it is every day. Every day we have to wake up and believe it will be 21 days from that morning. You’d be mad not to.” To that end, political staff across the spectrum have been inundating printers across the country with requests for poster orders. Some candidates have been alarmed to hear that there may be a lead-in time of four to five weeks. In the Labour Party, a plan has been formulated to contest more than 30 of the 43 constituencies. So far, 24 candidates have been picked, with more planned. A spokeswoman promises that the party will run “a new generation of strong Labour Dáil candidates.” “Our candidates are canvassing on the ground and building up their teams and the poster and leaflet preparation is full steam ahead,” she says. “Candidates have been provided with a batch of ‘Vote 1′ leaflets for use in the first few days of a snap election, and the party signed off on text and design for the main election literature this week.” The party says “key lessons” have been learned from its solid performance in the local and European elections in June, when it won a seat in the European Parliament for Aodhán Ó Riordáin in Dublin. “We expect an election to be called shortly and will be ready whenever it happens,” she says. The Social Democrats say they now have most of their candidates selected, with just a few outstanding. “We have been planning all along as if the election will be called in November, so we have posters organised and literature for candidates, and we are finalising the manifesto at the moment,” says a spokeswoman. Aontú is planning to run a candidate in every constituency, with 32 selected so far, their canvassing teams already out knocking on doors in Co Meath – where party leader and Aontú's sole TD Peadar Tóibín is based – and beyond. All of this work on the ground stands in stark contrast to the repeated pronouncements of Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who insists that the ideal time for a general election is February. The question is: ideal for who? Regardless, his party is setting out the organisational nuts and bolts for an election and may also been looking to internal polling, as most parties are, to formulate a strategy in different constituencies. Fianna Fáil has picked 60 candidates to date, and has only five constituency selection conventions to go. For all the talk of Fine Gael pulling the trigger, the party is not quite election-ready yet either, although they are well ahead of the pack. Fine Gael has only two selection conventions left and has picked 67 candidates in 41 constituencies so far. Of those, 26 are women, representing 38 per cent of all candidates chosen. Their candidates are made up of 17 sitting TDs, 11 Senators, 29 councillors and 10 non-public representatives. With so many sitting TDs retiring, and a lot of the councillor candidates being unknown at a national level, Fine Gael faces a particular challenge. A party source says that between those 29 councillors, they have 308 years’ political experience. Expect to hear this line a few times over the coming weeks and months. The source points towards party councillor Willie Aird, who is running in Laois: “Forty-five years waiting for his shot at glory – Prince William to take over from King Charlie in Laois,” the party insider quips. Fine Gael will end up running 75-80 candidates. In the meantime, half the battle is already being fought online as the three Government parties siphon their Budget 2025 wins out to their potential voters through their social media pages. The Green Party, who had selected 32 candidates as of Thursday, are online trying to remind voters of its role in ensuring the residential zoned land tax actually goes ahead, while announcing more money for heat pumps, free transport for under-nines and next year’s “baby boost”. Fine Gael is claiming it is putting more money in pockets. Fianna Fáil is honing in on infrastructure, education and the cost of living. Sinn Féin is attacking them all for wasting money and wanting to spend €9 million on “phone pouches” in schools. The party election machines are cranking up.",0,1
2024/10/5,"Sinn Féin aware a year ago that party members gave references to press officer convicted of child sex offences Party was contacted by British Heart Foundation in relation to Michael McMonagle in August 2023 Sinn Féin was aware more than a year ago that members of the party had provided references for a former colleague who was subsequently convicted of child sex offences. The party was contacted by the British Heart Foundation (BHF) on August 3rd 2023 as part of a review of its recruitment processes after it suspended former Sinn Féin press officer Michael McMonagle. The Irish Times understands an email dialogue took place between the BHF and a senior Sinn Féin HR official in which the charity shared that it had received two references from Sinn Féin. Seán Mag Uidhir, an influential Sinn Féin figure who headed the party’s media operation in the North and his colleague, Caolán McGinley, quit last weekend after it emerged they provided the references for another former party press officer, Michael McMonagle. Last week McMonagle, 42, from Limewood Street in Derry, pleaded guilty to two charges of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity, and 12 counts of attempted sexual communication with a child on dates from 2020-21. McMonagle was suspended from his job with Sinn Féin after he was arrested in August 2021, and in September 2022 was appointed to the role of Communications and Engagement Manager with the British Heart Foundation in Belfast. Following the resignation of Mr Mag Uidhir and Mr McGinley, Sinn Féin said it was made aware of the references on September 25th 2024 following a media inquiry, and it took immediate action. In a statement on Saturday, the Sinn Féin vice-president and the North’s First Minister, Michelle O’Neill, said she had learned on Thursday that “in August 2023, following media reports of charges against McMonagle, the British Heart Foundation contacted Sinn Féin’s former HR manager to verify the email address and identity of the senior press officer who had provided the reference the previous year which the HR Manager did. “This contact from the British Heart Foundation was not brought to my attention, or the attention of the Sinn Féin leadership, at that time. This was a serious omission,” she said. She also apologised on behalf of the party for the “hurt and distress” caused by the actions of Mr Mag Uidhir and Mr McGinley. “Sinn Féin will be issuing instructions to all managers and members of staff regarding future requests for character references,” Ms O’Neill said. “As a political leader and a mother, I want to be clear that the issue of child safeguarding is of paramount importance to me. The Sinn Féin leadership and I will ensure that a situation like this will never arise again.” In her statement, the Sinn Féin vice-president also outlined, “for the purpose of completeness” an “unrelated issue” she was made aware of over the last week “with an adult female colleague of Michael McMonagle at a non-work related social gathering a number of years ago. “This was in no way related to any child protection issue and related to him making the female colleague feel uncomfortable. “This was resolved by mutual agreement between them at the time,” she said. Ms O’Neill issued the statement following a telephone call on Saturday with the head of the BHF in Northern Ireland, Fearghal McKinney. Mr McKinney said he outlined to Ms O’Neill “the processes the British Heart Foundation undertook in hiring this individual, determining his suitability for employment including full reference checks and the robust internal investigation we undertook after learning of the serious charges against him. “Michelle O’Neill agreed recent comments by her and party colleagues questioning the BHF’s due diligence process were unhelpful, and she expressed regret for the damage and upset this has caused to our dedicated staff and supporters,” Mr McKinney said. He added that they had agreed the media focus on six-year-old organ donation campaigner Dáithí Mac Gabhann and his family has been “very distressing” for them. “We at the BHF are heartbroken that this courageous family have been dragged into this terrible situation and ask that the media be mindful of their privacy and wellbeing while they focus on finding a new heart for Dáithí and continue to spread their positive message of hope.” He said the BHF was “confident we undertook all necessary statutory and moral duties required throughout this entire process. “Our staff and volunteers in Northern Ireland have been devastated by this issue and our focus now must be on supporting them and focusing on what we are here to do – funding life-saving research to find the cures and treatments for heart and circulatory disease. “Lastly, our thoughts are with the children and their families who are the ultimate victims of these terrible crimes,” he said. In her statement, Ms O’Neill said “Michael McMonagle’s actions are utterly reprehensible, and he is being held fully accountable under the law. “His crimes have inflicted significant harm on his innocent victims. There is nothing more reprehensible than the abuse of a child.” She said that in August 2021, “when Michael McMonagle informed Sinn Féin of his arrest and questioning concerning serious criminal offences, the party took decisive action. “In line with our Child Protection Policy and Human Resources Handbook, he was immediately suspended from party membership and his position as a press officer, with his employment terminated in June 2022 when his contracted ended. “I was made aware of his suspension, and I had no further contact with him,” she said. The First Minister referenced the event in the Great Hall in Parliament Buildings at Stormont on February 14th 2023 in support of the ‘Donate4Daithí’ campaign hosted by the British Heart Foundation. Images have emerged of McMonagle in the vicinity of Ms O’Neill and other Sinn Féin figures. “My sole focus was on Dáithí and supporting the family to raise awareness for the campaign,” Ms O’Neill said. “I was not aware that Michael McMonagle was at this event, and I had no knowledge that he had gained employment with the British Heart Foundation. “On Wednesday 25th September 2024, Sinn Féin and I were informed that two press officers, who were former colleagues of Michael McMonagle, had provided employment references for him. I am absolutely appalled and horrified that this occurred. “These references were given without the knowledge or authorisation of the party. Under no circumstances would the party provide a reference, for work or otherwise, for Michael McMonagle. “The party took immediate action against both individuals. Their actions constituted gross misconduct, which would result in their dismissal. “As the party process was ongoing, both individuals resigned their positions and terminated their party membership with immediate effect on Saturday 28th September 2024. “On behalf of Sinn Féin, I apologise for the hurt and distress caused by their actions,” Ms O’Neill said. Referring to her call on Saturday morning with Mr McKinney, Ms O’Neill said the BHF was “an organisation that does great work providing support, research and advocacy services. “I am deeply sorry that they have been caught up in this unacceptable situation. I look forward to a continued constructive relationship with the British Heart Foundation in promoting heart health. “It is a matter of particular upset that the family of wee Dáithí, who is fighting such a brave fight, have been caught up in commentary around this situation,” she said. The DUP leader, Gavin Robinson, said that “in light of the most recent revelations”, Ms O’Neill should make a statement to the Assembly and answer questions. “It’s time for full transparency from Sinn Féin. Is the truth being hid or is there a total lack of competence? It’s time for honesty,” he said. “Sinn Féin explanations have not withstood scrutiny. With every new revelation undermining a previous Sinn Féin position, this issue requires deeper scrutiny.” Tánaiste Micheál Martin last night said Sinn Féin’s leadership still has questions to answer over the way it has addressed the issue. “I think the leadership of Sinn Féin should clarify the position, [the] who, what and when and so forth,” he told reporters at his party’s Cairde Fáil dinner in Dublin. “At the moment it is revelation after revelation. He said there was an onus on the leadership to clarify the exact sequence of events. In his speech at the event, Mr Martin accused Sinn Féin of running away from the media as soon as the questions get difficult. “I don’t believe that any other party on this island would behave in the same way that Sinn Féin has in the face of profoundly serious questions about a former employee charged with terrible crimes. A man who was given a reference and then allowed to work with children, even at events with the most senior Sinn Féin leaders. A man whose security clearance for Stormont was only revoked in the past few days – two years after he was charged,” he said.",0,1
2024/10/5,"‘Outrageous’ of Israel to threaten peacekeepers in Lebanon, President Michael D Higgins says  Israel rejects criticism, saying claim that IDF had threatened Unifil forces was ‘unfounded and inflammatory’ On the eve of the first anniversary of the Hamas attack that left scores of young people dead, injured and taken hostage at the Supernova Sukkot Gathering music festival in Israel on October 7th last year, the President condemned the escalation of deadly attacks across the Middle East and the threat to the lives of those in the Defence Forces. The President said that as “Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces, but I am sure as are all Irish citizens, I am thinking of what an anxious time it is for them”. Ireland’s contingent of close to 300 peacekeepers is part of an allocation of 10,000 Unifil soldiers. Mr Higgins said: “It is outrageous that the Israel Defence Forces have threatened this peacekeeping force and sought to have them evacuate the villages they are defending. “Indeed, Israel is demanding that the entire Unifil operating under UN mandates walk away.” The Israeli embassy in Dublin strongly criticised the President’s intervention, saying the claim that IDF had threatened Unifil forces was “unfounded and inflammatory”. In a statement, the embassy said the IDF “made a request through different channels to have some Unifil troops move from areas of military activity for their own protection and safety. “Let it be clear that the safety of peacekeeping forces is of immense importance to Israel. To attempt to characterise this as a threat to Unifil forces is another unfounded and inflammatory accusation levelled at Israel, as we have seen in the past months.” The embassy said “it should be remembered that for almost a year, the people of northern Israel have been under relentless bombardment by Hizbullah, forcing entire communities to flee their homes, a grim reality no other country would have suffered for so long. Israel has a duty and an obligation to protect its citizens and will act accordingly.” Speaking on Saturday, the President said Defence Forces members are “risking their lives, and their families are making this sacrifice”, on behalf of defenceless civilians in southern Lebanese villages. “We all daily think of them and the importance of their safety and provisions. “This is not only an insult to the most important global institution to which 193 members are committed, but it is also an insult to the soldiers and their families who have taken risks so we might all live in peace and protect the most vulnerable. “I am sure that the courage being displayed by our contingent and their colleagues has the thoughts and prayers of all those who value peace, at home and abroad.” The President said the month of October is, and will always be, a month full of sorrow for so many families particularly those “horrifically killed” at the Supernova Sukkot Gathering music festival in Israel. “The outrageous murder and assault of so many others by Hamas, and the taking of hostages, the anxiety for the safety of so many of whom is permanently in the hearts of their families,” he said. Mr Higgins said it “should not have come to such events, or the horrific events that followed of collective punishment, vengeance and destruction of the means of habitation, or, for example, the education and health of children”. He said it is “so important that we not make further additions to the loss and mutilation of life which occurred last October and which followed in the months since”. The Irish Government has protested strongly to Israel to withdraw its troops from close to an outpost on the border with Lebanon which is guarded by Irish Unifil troops. Tánaiste and Minister for Defence Micheál Martin said the safety of Irish troops remained the highest priority and he was gravely concerned that in the current heightened situation there was “potential for missiles to go in the wrong direction”. Over the past few days, platoons from the IDF have breached the ‘blue line’ that divides Lebanon from Israel in several areas, including at an Irish battalion post, known as 652. One platoon is now operating in proximity to the outpost, which Mr Martin has described as an “unacceptable violation” of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Mr Martin also pointed out there had been breaches of the resolution by Hizbullah. The 30 Irish troops at the outpost are operating under what is known as level 3 which means they are to shelter in place and remain in bunkers. They continue to monitor and report any violation of the resolution but Mr Martin described their present situation as “challenging”. Earlier on Saturday, Mr Martin said there was constant communication between Camp Shamrock and the outpost and that “I have been advised that morale is good, despite the circumstances.” Speaking at his party’s Cairde Fáil dinner in the Clayton Hotel last night, Mr Martin said the UN has made a protest against the Israeli government to desist and withdraw from proximity to 652. “The protection of our soldiers. That is my number one priority right now, is to protect our soldiers,” he said. “In situations like that, the potential for missiles to go in the wrong direction. That’s the key concern. We have professional soldiers. They’re very professional, brave, they’re courageous, they’re honourable, they’re in the best tradition of UN peacekeeping.” Mr Martin said the Government had done a bilateral ‘démarche’ [diplomatic protest] with Israel in relation to the movement of its troops so close to the outpost. The Defences Forces’ 124th Infantry Battalion, Ireland’s contribution to the Unifil missions, is comprised of 370 troops. However, there are currently fewer than 300 troops in the area of operations due, in part, to a large contingent of personnel returning to Ireland on leave before the latest hostilities.",0,1
2024/10/6,"PBP-Solidarity calls for €13bn in Apple tax to go towards home building Richard Boyd-Barrett says the money should be spent on building social housing People Before Profit-Solidarity has called for the €13 billion windfall to the State from the Apple case to fund a State construction company to build tens of thousands of social homes. At the party’s annual conference in Dublin, the Dún Laoghaire TD Richard Boyd-Barrett said that more than 100,000 families were waiting a decade or more on social housing lists. In his address to delegates, Mr Boyd-Barrett said young people did not “have a prayer” of getting their own home or even renting. He said that with a record number of homeless people, the only people benefiting were those that were “profiteering” from rent, including vulture funds. The alliance has five TDs in the Dáil but expects to increase its representation after the general election. Mr Boyd-Barrett told delegates not to believe the narrative that the outcome of the general election was a foregone conclusion. “That does not have to be the way,” he said. “We want to offer a clear alternative. We are fighting for a genuinely left Government that will not do any deal to prop up Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. “It requires a political will and principles to say we will not sell our political souls to go into Government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. We invite others on the left to join us in this project and use our position to build momentum.” He also accused the Government of being complicit in the occupation of Gaza and invasion of Lebanon by allowing US military flights to transit through Shannon Airport and also allow Israeli unions through Irish airspace. He challenged Taoiseach Simon Harris to tell Joe Biden at their meeting in the White House this month that the US President has been “complicit in genocide in Gaza”. His colleague Paul Murphy also said the eviction ban needed to be brought back. “We need to demand that society be run on the basis that people’s needs are met,” he said. “This means taking action like reinstating the eviction ban.”",0,1
2024/10/6,"Hundreds attend vigil in Dublin to mark one year since Hamas attack No prospect of peace as long as ‘murderous ideologies’ of Hamas and Hizbullah remain strong, says chief rabbi Israel is not waging a war of retaliation against Hamas for the October 7th atrocities “whatever some politicians in this country might have us think”, Ireland’s chief rabbi, Yoni Wieder, said at an event outside the Israeli embassy in Dublin on Sunday. Rabbi Weider did not identify to whom he was referring when speaking at a vigil held to mark one year since the Hamas attack in which more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. In November the then taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “something approaching revenge”. Rabbi Weider said Israel has been forced into war with Hamas, “a terrorist organisation that is not only intent on murdering Jews and destroying Israel, but is putting civilians in harm’s way”. Israel is not waging war against Hizbullah in southern Lebanon “because it has some sort of chip on its shoulder, whatever a recent shameful cartoon in The Irish Times might have some readers believe”, he said. Israel, he said, was waging war against Hamas and Hizbullah because it has the moral clarity to know that as long as their murderous ideologies remain influential, there is no prospect of peace. “Every innocent life that is lost is a heartbreaking humanitarian tragedy, but let us be clear, the responsibility for the deaths and the suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza over the last 12  months lies squarely at the feet of Hamas.” The vigil, organised by the Ireland Israel Alliance, was attended by several hundred people and heard songs, prayers, and the reading out of the names of the 101 people still being held hostage by Hamas. Among those at the event were Noel and Benjamin Porter, Jewish brothers from Germany currently studying in University College, Dublin. Asked about being a student in UCD, Noel referred to the pro-Palestinian encampment there earlier this year. “On the one hand I fully support the right to protest and the right to your own opinion. On the other hand, it is really tough to feel welcome when you hear chants like death to Zionism because I’m half Israeli, so it is death to me.” Benjamin, the older of the two brothers, said it has been “a bit tough” to hear people he is studying with saying “death to Zionism, globalise the Intifada, things like that”, though he believes this comes from a vocal minority. “It has been isolating at times, but you try and find a way. As Jews, you are always facing the prospect of marginalisation, so you learn to live with it. But it doesn’t make it any easier.” Eithne Lalor, from Terenure, who had an Israeli flag draped over her shoulders, said she made some good Israeli friends in the 1970s and had been to visit the country more than ten times since then. “I just feel the whole world is against Israel and it is just celebrating violence against them. I can’t believe it. A day after this atrocity people [could] turn around and celebrate Hamas, and murder, and it is only so many years away from the Holocaust.” Asked about the civilian casualties in Gaza, she said there had been higher rates of civilian casualties when London and Dresden were bombed during the second World War. “Hamas is hiding behind families, [building] tunnels around their bedrooms, their hospitals, their schools. They are creating victims really.”",0,1
2024/10/6,"Ireland ‘not immune’ to Russian espionage, says Taoiseach Reports that a politician working within the Oireachtas is a Russian intelligence asset No one should be surprised by Russian attempts to influence and distort public opinion in Ireland, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said, following reports that a politician working within the Oireachtas is a Russian intelligence asset. Mr Harris was responding to reports in the Sunday Times claiming that a politician working in the Oireachtas has been recruited by Russian intelligence services as “an agent of influence”. The Taoiseach said that while he would not comment directly on matters of national security he stated that Ireland was “not immune” to Russian attempts to sway public opinion. “It shouldn’t come as any surprise to any of us that Russia seeks to influence public opinion, seeks to distort public opinion, and is active in relation to that across the world, and that Ireland is not immune from that,” Mr Harris said, speaking to reporters prior to a Charles Stuart Parnell commemoration event held at Glasnevin Cemetery. Mr Harris said that there has been an increase in such activity since Russia’s “brutal, illegal” invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Sunday Times reported that the alleged Russian agent offered in helping to establish links between Russians and paramilitaries in Northern Ireland during Brexit talks despite not having links to said paramilitary groups. The newspaper reported that investigators have found no evidence of the parliamentarian – who was monitored by gardaí and the Defence Forces – receiving payments from Russia. As part of the recruitment operation the Sunday Times claims that the Russians used a “honeypot”, which in an agent that seeks to romantically engage a target. “The gardaí and our security services take all of these issues extremely seriously, monitor these issues extremely seriously, and work with international counterparts on all of these matters,” Mr Harris said. “I have great confidence in the ability of the gardaí working with international counterparts in relation to this.” Pressed on if he was aware who the alleged agent is, Mr Harris said: “We never comment in this country, and I’m not really sure of any country that does comment in relation to security matters. Not commenting is not giving a view one way or the other, it’s saying that we don’t ever put information in relation to security, national security, into the public domain. That’s not to say that these matters aren’t taken extraordinarily seriously.”",0,1
2024/10/7,"Other countries have not made claims on €13bn Apple tax, says Jack Chambers Minister for Finance points out that any such action, if it were to happen, would be submitted as part of ‘technical process’ No other country has submitted a claim to part of the €13 billion Apple tax bill since the EU’s highest court recently ruled the tech giant had to pay over the large sum in back taxes to Ireland. Minister for Finance Jack Chambers said he was not aware of any contact from other countries seeking to lay claim to part of the giant tax bill. Last month the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ended a years long legal saga, siding with the European Commission by ruling that Apple did owe Ireland the multibillion euro sum. The figure amounted to the tax the multinational previously had not paid on profits, due to a favourable tax arrangement that existed for its Irish subsidiaries over several years. Some €455 million of the €13 billion was set aside between 2019 and 2021 to be paid to unnamed countries that had a tax claim on the same profits, leading to speculation more countries might come forward following the final ECJ judgment. Speaking on Monday, Mr Chambers said he was not aware of “any further third country adjustment” being made to the tax windfall due to be paid to Ireland. Any application by another country claiming it was owed some of the taxes from the Apple profits would be submitted as part of a “technical process”, he said. “The application would be made via the company by another jurisdiction, so it’s very much grounded in rules and based on objective criteria, rather than any subjective basis of assessment being made by Ireland,” he said. “I’m not aware of any further third country adjustment or contact on third country adjustment that have been made since we received the Apple judgment,” he said. The sum of €13 billion plus interest had been held in an escrow account while Apple and Ireland appealed the European Commission’s initial decision that the previous tax arrangement amounted to illegal state aid. Following the ECJ ruling some €8 billion is to be paid to Ireland this year and a further €6 billion next year, Mr Chambers said. Separately, the Minister said he rejected the suggestion the recent budget had been a “giveaway” in advance of a coming general election. “Many of the Opposition parties whom have criticised the Irish Government put forward spending proposals far in excess of what we outlined in Budget 2025,” he said. Mr Chambers said there was still work to do “driving forward a number of pieces of legislation” before the end of the Government’s term in the spring. He said he was not interested in speculation about when the general election “may or may not take place”. He was speaking in Luxembourg on his way into a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.",0,1
2024/10/7,"Peadar Tóibín was approached to meet Putin in 2017 but ‘wasn’t interested’ Aontú leader calls on political parties to audit members for potential contact from Russian intelligence Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín has called on Irish political parties to audit their members to see if anyone has received potential contact from Russian intelligence, after revealing he was approached to meet president Vladimir Putin in 2017. As a then-member of Sinn Féin, Mr Toibin received the approach via a consultancy company in a number of phone calls. He said he was offered a five-star hotel for the trade trip and later a meeting with Mr Putin. His revelations follow a Sunday Times report that an Oireachtas member has been recruited by Russian intelligence as “an agent of influence”, a situation Mr Tóibín described as “extremely serious”. “Given the antidemocratic nature of Putin at the time I indicated that I wasn’t interested in that [2017] approach,” he told RTÉ radio on Monday. “My instinct is that the Russian government is a government that has very, very antidemocratic instincts and [that] is not something that I would be interested in being associated with.” Details of the contact were forwarded to Sinn Féin party officials, and the party has reportedly confirmed it did not send a representative to the event. Mr Tóibín said although people might see a light side to the idea of Irish politicians being targeted, “the world is in a very, very serious situation with the war in Ukraine and given the fact that Ireland obviously plays a role within the European Union and can have influence on processes, there is no doubt in my mind that Ireland would be potentially a target for Russian espionage.” Describing what he said was “very dangerous” potential undue influence from abroad, he called on Irish political parties to begin auditing their memberships for signs of other such approaches. In the aftermath of the Sunday Times report, Taoiseach Simon Harris said nobody should be surprised by Russian attempts to influence and distort public opinion in Ireland.",0,1
2024/10/8,"Presidential award for footballer Seamus Coleman, designer Orla Kiely and playwright Rosalind Scanlon  Tánaiste says Irish people overseas ‘continue to make vital contributions to their communities and on the international stage’ Footballer Seamus Coleman, designer Orla Kiely and playwright Rosalind Scanlon have been named among this year’s recipients of the Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad. The writer Aduke Gomez; Prof Enrico Terrinoni, an English literature academic; Sr Teresa McKeon, a Sierre Leon-based teacher; and Irish American Democrats founder Stella O’Leary were also honoured. Mary O’Neil and Patrick Leahy in the US, and Pam O’Mahony in Australia, completed the list of 10 recipients announced by Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin. The awards will be presented by President Michael D Higgins at a ceremony in Áras an Uachtaráin in January 2025. “Irish people overseas continue to make vital contributions to their communities and on the international stage. I am always very honoured when I get to see first-hand the impact they make locally and globally,” Mr Martin said. The 10 2024 recipients are said to represent various areas in which the “global Irish” are making a difference, including the arts, culture, sport, charitable and community works, business, peace, inclusion and equality. “The Presidential Distinguished Service Award acknowledges the connection between the work of the recipients and our values as a nation, strengthening the ties between Ireland and the Diaspora,” Mr Martin said.",0,1
2024/10/8,"Overseas intelligence agencies’ following well worn playbook for recruiting in Ireland  ‘Influence operations’ by Russia and China are not uncommon as reports allege an Oireachtas member is working as an asset for Russian security services  Reports alleging that a serving Oireachtas member is working as an asset for Russian security services have, inevitably, sent shock waves through the political system. However, the playbook for recruiting and operating influential people as intelligence assets – be they politicians, from the world of business, or elsewhere – is well worn, according to people familiar with the area. One source who has experience in dealing with intelligence at a senior level says the extent of so-called “influence operations” run by the likes of Russia and China in the western world would surprise the uninitiated. “It starts off with a meal in a fancy restaurant in Dublin,” outlines this person, sketching out a scenario where a potential source is courted by an intelligence operative – ostensibly under the guise of normal diplomatic or political relations. This in turn may be followed by more social engagements and introductions to figures in the business world who are billed as wanting to strengthen economic ties. In addition to politicians themselves, their advisers and other people around them can become targets. Ultimately this can culminate in a trip overseas, where further privileges and perks are lavished on the subject, potentially including the engineering of compromising situations or the extraction of information that can be used against them. So-called “honeypots” or the hacking of devices or email accounts can also be used. According to security sources, money can play a role, including offers to arrange business finance through shell companies at attractive interest rates. The object is often not spying, as it might be traditionally understood – obtaining and passing back secret information. Indeed, the level of sensitive information available to ordinary Oireachtas members would be far below that available to Ministers or senior civil servants, or those in charge of State agencies or other bodies. However, security sources say that Russia and others might ask that an asset seek a briefing on physical infrastructure such as subsea cables on the pretext of being concerned about Irish vulnerability; or simply use talking points that are adjacent to an overseas actor’s interest, for example, critiquing directly or indirectly Irish support for Ukraine. The story has prompted calls to strengthen oversight of Oireachtas members, as well as to better prepare them for a world in which they may be the subject of an approach from overseas intelligence agencies. Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín has said political parties need to conduct an audit of their members’ trips overseas funded by outside parties. Mr Tóibín outlined that while a member of Sinn Féin, he was approached with an offer of an all expenses paid trip to Russia including a meeting with Vladimir Putin, which he turned down. The person who allegedly made the offer did not respond to requests for comment. Charlie Flanagan, the Fine Gael TD and a former minister for justice and foreign affairs, says training should be given to Oireachtas members to help them detect overtures. “There should be a form of training, it should be available for all TDs and Senators and I say so particularly in context of the forthcoming general election where there will be a slew of new people [elected],” he said. “If there are public figures who feel under pressure to a blackmail or honeypot-style compromise, gardaí can help.”",0,1
2024/10/8,"Gardaí have compiled list of Oireachtas members and other people they believe have been targeted by Russians Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín calls on Irish political parties to audit members to see if anyone has received potential contact from Russian intelligence  Gardaí have compiled a list of members of the Oireachtas and other people, including those in academia, they believe have been targeted by Russians in Ireland seeking to exploit them for information gathering and destabilising the State. One member of the Oireachtas was allegedly contacted by personnel attached to the Russian embassy during Brexit, according to a report in the Sunday Times. Sources said other similar approaches were made around the same time, and in the period since, by Russia to Oireachtas members, through third parties, in a bid to begin the process of building relationships with them. Though it is thought the majority of these approaches were rebuffed some are believed to have resulted in meetings with the third parties who initiated the contact. The sources said some of those targeted likely believed they were being approached for business or consultancy reasons, though the end goal was to compromise them for the purposes of being exploited. Allegations of a Russian asset operating inside the Oireachtas were first investigated following a tip off from UK intelligence services several years ago. However, the investigation by J2, Ireland’s military intelligence branch, established nothing of substance following this initial step. It is not clear if further investigations have taken place in the interim. At the time the Oireachtas member at the centre of the Sunday Times reports was warned several times by the Garda he was effectively the target of Russian grooming – though he broke no laws. A Garda list of other Oireachtas members had been compiled as having been approached. Political and security sources said on Monday that influence operations targeting high-profile people in politics, business or other spheres are often conducted under the guise of ordinary diplomatic or political engagements, but can be escalated by the use of compromising material or monetary incentives. On Monday Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said the identity of the politician concerned should be revealed. Speaking to reporters Mr Ryan said it was a “very significant allegation”. “If that was the case, obviously, it is a real concern, and a real security concern if you have a member of the Oireachtas acting in such a way,” he said. “It’s very hard to know how that person could be identified. That is something that would benefit the rest of us so that the suspicion doesn’t go on the entire Oireachtas. But legally, obviously, that has to be done, so we have to wait and see how the allegations made can be verified.” Mr Ryan said he has never been approached by anyone connected to the Russian government. “I heard [Aontú leader] Peadar Tóibín saying that he had been approached by the Russians ... that was the first I was aware of that.” In the aftermath of the report Taoiseach Simon Harris said nobody should be surprised by Russian attempts to influence and distort public opinion in Ireland. Earlier Mr Tóibín called on Irish political parties to audit their members to see if anyone has received potential contact from Russian intelligence after revealing he was offered a trade trip to Moscow and an audience with president Vladimir Putin in 2017. As a then-member of Sinn Féin, Mr Toibin received the approach via a consultancy company in a number of phone calls but did not attend.",0,1
2024/10/8,"Concerns about Russian ‘asset’ among Oireachtas members raised in Dáil No response officially or politically to report in media on member ‘recruited by Russian intelligence’, says TD Duncan Smith Concerns about an alleged Russian “asset” among Oireachtas members was raised in the Dáil as the House voted on the Order of Business even before Leaders’ Questions had commenced. Labour TD Duncan Smith said there had been no response officially or politically to “the revelation to the front page of The Sunday Times that there’s a member of the Oireachtas that has been recruited by Russian intelligence”. He said “it’s been sneered and laughed at and dismissed by many since, but there’s a matter of utmost importance and seriousness, and I haven’t seen anything either internally, from the Oireachtas or politically” about “how we’re going to actually counter and deal with this. I would like to hear something, either from yourself Ceann Comhairle or from the Taoiseach, as to how we’re going to manage and deal with this in our own House.” Earlier, Solidarity TD Mick Barry said he would call a vote on the Order of Business after Taoiseach Simon Harris requested the Dáil to sit an hour earlier as he is flying to the US to meet US president Joe Biden. Mr Barry said the Taoiseach should not be celebrating the presidency of a man who is arming and financing genocide against the Palestinians. Independent TD Mattie McGrath said: “I don’t know what’s going on with the Taoiseach, but he has the media driven demented. He has the people driven demented. He’s us driven demented. I think he’ll become he’s become a demented himself. And I think it’s time now to stop on all the tricks the snakes and ladders. Have a bit of cop on and respect for the people as well as this House.

2024/10/8,"Israeli units not a direct threat to Irish troops in south Lebanon, Cabinet told Government indicates that Israel Defense Forces has withdrawn from positions close to Irish post The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) do not pose a direct threat to a post occupied by Irish soldiers in Lebanon, but their behaviour in proximity to the post is “unacceptable”, the Cabinet was told during a lengthy briefing on the situation. Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin told Ministers the UN had issued diplomatic correspondence to Israel — known as a “note verbale” — last Friday about the situation. The State also issued a similar note to the United Nations on the issue. Contrary to some reports, Ministers were told, the Defence Forces has advised the Government that there are sufficient supplies of food and water in Camp Shamrock and the outposts. Arrangements had also been put in place for enhanced communication with family members of peacekeepers on the situation. “A family liaison officer is communicating with families, giving social media updates, and the Defence Forces Personnel Support Services are available for troops and families,” said an official. The Cabinet was also told that the UN has contingency plans in case of an improvement or deterioration of the situation in southern Lebanon. On Tuesday night, the Government said that the IDF has withdrawn from positions close to the Irish post. “This is extremely welcome news. The safety of our soldiers is paramount and when I spoke to [UN] secretary general [António] Guterres last night he was completely at one with me on the urgency of the situation. I thank the secretary general for his efforts following our discussions,” said Taoiseach Simon Harris. The Cabinet also approved the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill, which will be necessary to give legislative effect to the budget measures and must be passed before a general election. The Finance Bill is to be published on Thursday and will begin its passage in the Dáil next Wednesday. The Social Welfare Bill is also expected to be published and debated in the Dáil next week. A spokeswoman for the Taoiseach said the Bill would finish all stages in the Dáil and Seanad by the end of this month, clearing the way for the one-off payments to begin in November, and for an early election if that is agreed by the Coalition leaders. However, a spokesman for Mr Martin said that the Finance Bill is not scheduled to pass through all stages in the Dáil and Seanad until December 11th. That schedule will have to change if there is to be an agreed early election. Sources in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael confirmed that Mr Harris and Mr Martin did not discuss an early election at their leaders’ meeting on Monday night.

Punam Rane, a councillor for Kimmage-Rathmines, told the meeting of Dublin City Council that “nobody is taking a stance” on the Israeli assault on Gaza. “USA or America should have taken a stance, but how many of you know the entire US economy today is ruled by the Jews, by Israel, they will never be able to take a stance,” she said.

Nonetheless, we have referred the matter to the Party’s Disciplinary Procedures for breach of the Party Pledge to not express prejudiced, stereotyped or discriminatory views.” In the Monday evening meeting, Cllr Rane said with the US elections coming next month, “it will cripple the whole US economy if they take a stance, and therefore they’re afraid of taking a stance, that’ll never happen unless and until the global powers that are emerging take a stance themselves and make US take a stance, and that’s what’s happening.” “Why do you think there is so much of prolonged war, Russia and Ukraine, currently Palestine because nobody here is ready to take a stance, and therefore I think we should take a stance and US has to take a stance here in this case.” People Before Profit Cllr Conor Reddy immediately interjected, asking Lord Mayor James Geoghegan to ask Cllr Rane to “clarify her remarks on Jews controlling the American economy”. “That’s tremendously unhelpful, we’re all here in solidarity with Palestine ... to equate Judaism and Zionism is a complete fallacy, it’s wrong, and I think we all stand against anti-Semitism and it would be helpful if she could withdraw that particular use of words,” he said. Cllr Rane responded: “I didn’t actually mean a particular community, but I’m just saying, today the US economy is ruled by the Israelis, it’s not wrong, they have worked hard for it ... what I’m saying the US is not able to take a stance today because of their financial dependency.” In a social media post on Tuesday, Cllr Rane said: “I completely withdraw my comments made at last night’s city council meeting in relation to a motion on the Occupied Territories Bill. It was wrong and I fully apologise for it.” Speaking to The Irish Times on Tuesday, Cllr Reddy said there is a “very common misunderstanding that’s really unhelpful that Zionism is some type of driving force in dictating US foreign policy – that gets it all wrong,” he said, arguing that the United States rather uses Israel as a “watchdog for its own interests in the Middle East”. “It’s not that there’s this powerful or shady lobby operating behind the scenes,” he said, adding that Cllr Rane’s contribution was “very crudely put”. He said an equivalence between the Jewish people and the Israeli state is “unhelpful, inaccurate and far from what’s going on in the world.” He said he believes Fine Gael now had questions to answer arising from the comments. World Jewish Congress president Ronald S Lauder said Ms Rane’s “blatant scapegoating of Jews warrants a strong response by Fine Gael”. “Taoiseach Simon Harris, as the leader of his country and his party, must make clear that there is no place for anti-Semitism in Ireland. When President Biden meets with him, I hope that he raises the urgent crisis of anti-Semitism facing Jews worldwide, including for Irish Jews,” he said. The Jewish Representative Council of Ireland said it was “appalled” by Cllr Rane’s comments. “Her subsequent apology is not accepted, and Fine Gael should consider whether she ought to be removed from the party,” said council chairman Maurice Cohen. “The Jewish Community is also appalled by the fact that these remarks coincided with a remembrance ceremony held in Terenure Synagogue for the 1,200 slaughtered on the 7th October 2023.” Mr Cohen said comments like Cllr Rane’s “have led to Ireland being labelled as the most anti-Semitic country in Europe”.",0,1
2024/10/9,"No spies coming in from the cold in Seanad as Senators rule themselves out as Russian agent Tongue-in-cheek denials follow recent reports that an Oireachtas member had allegedly been recruited by Russian intelligence There were no spies coming in from the cold in the Seanad on Wednesday as senators took the opportunity to deny they were Russian “assets”. Their tongue-in-cheek denials follow the weekend revelation that a member of the Oireachtas had allegedly been recruited by Russian agents. Fianna Fáil Senator Timmy Dooley initiated a series of non-confessions on Wednesday morning when he declared he was not a spy and urged others to do likewise. He had been calling for a debate on data centres during Order of Business proceedings. “There have been some rumours circulating that members of the Upper House have been involved with Russia and there may or may not be a spy in our midst,” he said. “I think its important in order to avoid any potential stain on this house, that members would voluntarily make a statement that they are not the subject of any investigation or that they have never been in the clutches of Russia,” Mr Dooley added. “And before I sit down, I can declare that I am not such person,” he said. The Sunday Times reported that a TD or Senator, identified as “Cobalt” was recruited during the talks on Brexit between 2016 and 2020 and that a “honeytrap” was used in the operation. The story has provided much speculation about which of the 160 TDs and 60 Senators was involved, although the “asset” was reported as male. Cathaoirleach Jerry Buttimer intervened, warning Mr Dooley to be cautious and said that nobody had been identified as the member recruited by Russian intelligence. Mr Buttimer added: “And I too, Senator Dooley like you, am not one of those people either.” Fianna Fáil Senator Fiona O’Loughlin quipped during laughter in the House that she was not the spy either. Fine Gael Senator Maria Byrne also confirmed: “I am not one either.” Fianna Fáil Senator Malcolm Byrne also confirmed: “I am not a spy, I have no doubt that Senator Dooley isn’t a Russian spy himself.” He added that Mr Dooley was too busy watching his party and Clare constituency colleague TD Cathal Crowe. While Senators took a light hearted approach to the spy matter, at the weekend the only TD with high-ranking military experience described Ireland as “ground zero” among EU countries as a target for hybrid attacks and influence operations by Russia. Independent Kildare TD Cathal Berry, a former Defence Forces Army Ranger Wing commander with extensive overseas experience said: “If you are looking to affect a western country with extensive assets and a poor security culture then Ireland is ground zero”. Mr Berry said there was such a poor security culture in Ireland that many of the 220 members of the Oireachtas were not aware they were potential targets, even in terms of the accessibility of their mobile phones.",0,1
2024/10/9,"Top-ups to Ukrainians in State-funded housing shows welfare cuts were not ‘properly thought through’, says NGO Decision in May to reduce welfare has had ‘unintended consequences’ and left people struggling to meet food, transport and other costs Cuts to welfare payments for Ukrainians in State-funded accommodation were not “properly thought through”, an NGO working in the sector has said. The criticism comes after it emerged that the Government is paying top-ups to thousands of Ukrainians in hotels and other serviced accommodation after reduced social welfare payments meant they could not meet the cost of food agreed under pre-existing deals with providers. “They’re only working through what all those unintended consequences are because they’re imposing something that wasn’t properly thought through,” said Emma Lane-Spollen, national co-ordinator of the Ukraine Civil Society Forum. Ms Lane-Spollen said she was aware of situations where the welfare cuts had left people struggling to afford specialised food requirements, transport and other necessities. “It’s evident that the politicians who made the decision were not aware people were already contributing for food, for laundry, for all other expenses.” The Government agreed in May to reduce welfare payments to all Ukrainians in serviced accommodation to €38.80 per week for an adult and €29.80 for a child. However, the Department of Integration confirmed that where Ukrainians are making a contribution towards the cost of their meals, they receive a supplement to defray the costs of €70 per adult and €35 per child. Ms Lane-Spollen called for amendments to be made which would allow for “more flexibility in the system, because we want a more humane approach”. Meanwhile, Taoiseach Simon Harris backed away from policy options being developed by officials which could see Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion not being offered accommodation after they arrive in Ireland. The options, first reported in The Irish Times this week, were developed by senior officials over the summer and also included a potential “maximum stay” rule aimed at Ukrainians living in State housing for long periods and ending accommodation for those who earn above a certain threshold. Speaking in Washington, DC in advance of a meeting with US president Joe Biden, Mr Harris told reporters that he was not being critical of the officials and it was right that issues be kept under review. “I read those proposals this morning and it is true that these things get discussed,” he said, but added that Ireland was at “the outer limits” of what it could do in terms of scaling back the offering for Ukrainians. He said the proposals have not yet come to Cabinet, “but I am not convinced, quite frankly ... I think we have done quite a lot in the Ukrainian space already that has been sensible and fair and justifiable but I don’t think there is space to do much more.” He said the Government was more focused on revising measures for those applying for international protection, including the potential introduction of a contribution charge for asylum seekers. On the issue of top-up payments, a Department of Integration spokesman said the Government had agreed to bring “equivalence of treatment” to Ukrainians arriving before and after March 14th who are living in State-provided accommodation where meals and utilities are provided. He said that as of earlier this month, standard social assistance payments are no longer available to people living in State accommodation centres. “Residents continue to have access to accommodation, healthcare and education, if needed. Those who are paying a contribution towards their meals will have this amount included in their new payment. Other expenses, including laundry, will have to be met from the weekly payment. “At all times, the department is conscious of the need to adopt a humane approach to the provision of accommodation, while taking account of the need for a consistent, sustainable and cost-effective accommodation system.” The spokesman added that Ukrainians are free to make their own private arrangements for accommodation and will then be entitled to apply for standard social welfare payments.",0,1
2024/10/9,"Ireland and US celebrate enduring ties amid changing times  Joe Biden and Simon Harris will meet in the White House on Wednesday against an extraordinary backdrop  It was not even seven months ago but already the St Patrick’s Day scenes at the White House on a sunny March Sunday belong to a vanishing political era. When US president Joe Biden addressed the gathering, he jokingly referenced the milestone of 100 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and the United States., quipped that he wasn’t there at the beginning. At the time, Biden was lightly batting away concerns about his age and stamina that would ultimately lead to his extraordinary decision to not go ahead as the Democratic nominee in this year’s presidential election. As it transpired, the happy event proved to be the last international duty of then taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who sensationally resigned from the role just two days after flying home from Washington. Now, in the waning months of his presidency, Biden is preparing to welcome Taoiseach Simon Harris to the White House to formally mark that centenary with a two-day programme that has been hastily amended and reduced in acknowledgement of the anticipated threat presented by Hurricane Milton. It is due to strike the west coast of Florida on Wednesday, causing the abrupt cancellation of a planned gathering in the Rose Garden with over 300 guests and speeches by both leaders. Instead, Harris and Biden will hold a low-key 30-minute scheduled conversation in the Oval Office. The Taoiseach will also follow through with other engagements, including a meeting with the Friends of Ireland caucus and a visit to Georgetown university on Thursday morning. In advance of the visit, Harris said the US was the first country to recognise Ireland diplomatically, adding that he welcomes the opportunity to discuss “the many challenges we face, including the desperate situation in Gaza and the wider Middle East”. He described the US-Irish relationship as a “unique and special” one that is “renewed and strengthened with each generation”. A resolution to commemorate the 100th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the countries was introduced by US representatives Mike Kelly and Richard Neal in July. “For the last 100 years, the United States and Ireland have maintained a strong relationship rooted in our shared democratic values,” Neal said then. “Whether it be our economic ties or our mutual commitment to promote freedom and rules-based international order around the globe, the United States and Ireland have stood by one another for the last century. We will continue to do so for the next 100 years and beyond.” Biden has, through his five-decade political life, worn his ancestral links to Ireland as a badge of honour and he joins a famous cast of American politicians, from former presidents Bill Clinton and John F Kennedy to House Speaker Tip O’Neill, who were crucial in furthering the concept of a special relationship between the two countries. The formal opening of the relationship is recognised as October 7th, 1924 when then Irish ambassador Timothy Smiddy presented his credentials to president Calvin Coolidge. From the crucial role of the Clinton administration in the talks that culminated in the Belfast Agreement to the widespread Irish unease at the use of Shannon Airport by US military during the Iraq War in 2003, which was interpreted by many as stretching the integrity of Irish neutrality, the relationship between both countries has remained close even as the traditional “Irish” vote in the US became diluted. Nostalgia, historical attachment and economic pragmatism are the chief binds a century into a relationship that will be celebrated against the backdrop of an unprecedented storm and a bitterly divisive US election.",0,1
2024/10/9,"Simon Harris tells Joe Biden ‘proportionality has been totally lost by the Netanyahu government’ Taoiseach says he ‘made clear the position of the Irish people’ on Gaza to US president On a day when the White House administration was in emergency mode as Florida braced itself for what president Joe Biden declared “the storm of the century”, Taoiseach Simon Harris used Wednesday’s meeting to reiterate Ireland’s advocacy for an immediate cessation of violence in Gaza. “I made it clear the position of the Irish people, of the Irish Government, that we know what it is like in Ireland to not feel seen by the world,” he said on Wednesday evening, immediately after an hour-long meeting in the Oval Office. “That we know what it is like to have our national identity hijacked by a terrorist organisation. Because Palestine is not Hamas. Hamas is a despicable terrorist organisation and the terrorist attack they carried out on October 7th last year should be condemned forever by all right-thinking people. But proportionality has been totally lost by the Netanyahu government and the number of people, particularly the number of children, needlessly dying, as a result of the approach taken by Netanyahu is unacceptable.” Mr Harris, asked whether he specifically pressed Mr Biden on the need to suspend the delivery of weaponry to Israel, reiterated his stance that he had made Ireland’s view clear, but that the foreign diplomacy of the United States was its concern. However, over the course of the meeting, president Biden recounted a conversation he had with the Israeli leader earlier on Wednesday – their first conversation since August. “It is for president Biden to speak to that, but he left me in no doubt that this was a conversation of substance and of depth in terms of actions that Israel needs to take in terms of humanitarian aid, of bringing about a ceasefire. He left me in absolutely no doubt of the redoubling of efforts to try and bring about a ceasefire and that he sees a two-state solution as the only way forward.” The schedule of the two-day visit to mark the centenary of Ireland-United States diplomatic relations was considerably reduced in response to the gravity and potential destructive potency of the storm hitting the west coast of Florida. The Irish visit was preceded by the controversy caused by the comments of Dublin city councillor for Fine Gael, Punam Kane, who said at a meeting that the US economy is “ruled by the Jews, by Israel”. Her remarks led to a call by the president of the World Jewish Congress for Mr Harris to act decisively. “The comments were utterly wrong, absolutely offensive, entirely inappropriate and are utterly condemned by me,” Mr Harris said on Wednesday morning. “We have established a disciplinary process that has to be swift and robust.” Mr Harris also condemned the recent opinion, in a since-deleted social media post, by Matthew Brodsky – a peace adviser who has claimed to advise members of Congress and the National Security Council during the Trump administration – that Israeli forces should “carpet bomb” an area of Lebanon garrisoned by Irish peacekeeping troops. “Well, isn’t that the most disgusting thing you could possibly have heard? Disgusting and inappropriate. Our peacekeepers are doing an extraordinary job and have been for many years.” Reflecting on speculation that the announcement of an Irish general election for November is imminent, Mr Harris said “the timing of the election is a matter for me. It is my constitutional prerogative to use my judgment as to when best to seek a dissolution of the Dáil by President Higgins, but I have said very clearly that the Government in my view is working well and therefore I don’t intend to surprise Coalition colleagues and I would like the Government to come to a good end, to complete its work.”",0,1
2024/11/1,"Former international referee to seek Dáil seat for Fianna Fáil in Wexford Michelle O’Neill was an assistant referee at 2019 Women’s World Cup final Party sources have confirmed that Michelle O’Neill, a Wexford native who was an assistant referee at the 2019 Women’s World Cup final, is to be added to the ticket in the four seat constituency alongside Minister of State James Browne. The constituency is expected to be extremely competitive after a carve-up which saw its territory much reduced in last year’s Electoral Commission redrawing of Dáil constituencies. She will compete with Ms Murphy, Mr Browne, three Fine Gael candidates, a strong Labour candidate and a strong Aontú candidate - with persistent local rumours that former TD Mick Wallace may contest the election. Ms O’Neill won 368 first preference votes as an Independent under the Wexford Independent Alliance banner in June’s local elections. Fianna Fáil said she is “one of the country’s most accomplished female referees with an impressive career in sports”. Ms O’Neill said she was “delighted” to be added to the ticket, saying she was a “very proud Wexford woman”. “I am ready to work for the people of Wexford by being a strong local voice on issues facing my constituents.

2024/11/1,"No mandate for new charges for motorists ‘at this stage’ of current Government, says Harris Remarks come after Green Party sought to bring latest traffic strategy to Cabinet for approval before general election The Government does not have a mandate “at this stage” for a strategy that includes the possibility of new charges for motorists, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. His remarks came after the Green Party sought to bring the latest version of the “Moving Together” strategy on traffic congestion to Cabinet for approval before the general election which is expected to take place later this month. The Irish Independent reported on Friday that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have blocked the move to progress the strategy amid concern over possible new taxes or charges for motorists. Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman said on Friday that there that there are no proposals for new taxes though it looks at potential ways of replacing motor tax income as people switch to electric vehicles. He acknowledged there has been “pushback” within the Coalition on the strategy. At a separate press conference Mr Harris said: “I signed up for a Programme for Government that was anti-carbon, not anti-car. “I think it’s very important that we recognise that there is still a need for cars in this country, and many people will have switched to electric vehicles. “They need roads to drive on ... Our public transport needs good road infrastructure as well.” He added: “This Government has neared the end of its time in office. “I don’t think the Government has a mandate at this stage to come at the Irish people with a range of new charges and taxes. “I’m not in favour of it and any government that I’m a part of won’t progress things around tolls and congestion charges.” The Fine Gael leader said the climate agenda needs to be advanced and his party is ambitious on that “but you do that by bringing people with you and at the moment, in the midst of a cost of living crisis, increasing tolls, congestion charges and the likes is not where we need to be at.” An earlier version of the strategy entitled – Moving Together: A Strategic Approach to the Improved Efficiency of the Transport System in Ireland – has already been published. Mr O’Gorman said it has been discussed at Cabinet previously and it sets out ways in which local authorities in particular can better manage congestion and brings forward suggestions on how we can reduce congestion in our cities. He said there are “no proposals for new taxes” but the strategy: “does flag the issue that as more people move to e-cars as we have fewer petrol and diesel cars, VRT, motor tax is going to decrease and that’s a big chunk of the income”. Mr O’Gorman added: “We are going to look at ways of how we fill that gap and this talks about some of the potentials.” But he said: “This is a strategy. This isn’t a taxation document. “It is focused on delivering better solutions to the congestion we see in our towns and cities.” Mr O’Gorman said there had been “pushback” from his party’s Coalition partners on this and “on some other pieces as well”. He said: “We’ve a proposal in terms of reform of the road strategy where there’s pushback.” Mr O’Gorman added: “My view was we work all the way to the end of this Government. “We continue to bring meaningful proposals forward. “That’s what our party has done. That’s what I’m doing across my department. “I had no kind of sense that we were going to, you know, down tools two weeks out.” He said his party will “continue to make the case for working all the way to the end of this Government and continuing to deliver meaningful proposals”.",0,1
2024/11/11,"Fine Gael pledges to deliver over 300,000 homes over next six years Party says it will ensure about 50,000 homes are built each year under €40bn plan Fine Gael has pledged to deliver over 300,000 homes in the next six years under a new €40 billion housing plan unveiled by the party. Taoiseach Simon Harris announced the party proposes to complete 303,000 homes between 2025 and 2030 on Monday, a rate of just over 50,000 homes a year. Mr Harris said that 53 per cent of the homes built will receive some form of support from the State. He said that there would be an average of €2 billion in additional funding each year being spent on housing by 2030. He added that the Land Development Agency would be expanded. The plan also proposes a €10 billion raid on the Apple tax fund to help finance the programme. The plan has committed to increase the help to buy grant to €40,000 and to extend the scheme to first-time buyers of second-hand homes, an increase of a third since the last change in 2020. The party plans to keep that scheme in place until 2030. Mr Harris said that a “red line issue” for the party would be the help to buy scheme, which he insisted would remain if Fine Gael were in Government. “We will not go into Government in any scenario where the rug is pulled from first-time buyers. Not doing it,” he said. He contended that Fine Gael initiatives would be worth up to €40,000 to first-time buyers, plus an additional €90,000 in the first home scheme (where the State or a bank takes a stake in the property). By contrast, he claimed, Sinn Féin’s housing policy would offer support of only €4,500 to first-time buyers. The Taoiseach told a press conference in Dublin that housing remains the greatest challenge that the State faces. “It is the single biggest societal and economic concern across Ireland,” said Mr Harris. “We have to scale up ambition. We need to take bold steps to increase supply,” he said. “For every home delivered in the past five years, we will build two in the next five years.” The plan envisages 66,500 social homes; 51,000 affordable homes; and 20,250 cost rentals, with the remaining 165,000 homes being private. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said that more serviced land was needed in Dublin and across the country for balanced development. The party has also pledged to increase the rent tax credit to €1,500 per individual, or €3,000 per couple. It has also committed to maintain the rent pressure zones and continue the landlord tax credit to 2030. Asked if the construction sector had the capacity to avail of the €10 billion injection of funding from the Apple Tax fund, Mr Donohoe said that the programme would expand on a phased basis to allow capacity increase. Minister of State Alan Dillon, a TD for Mayo, said at the launch that the party was committing to building 50 per cent of the new homes are built outside the five major cities. He said that part of Fine Gael’s plans would be to get better use of existing properties and to continue and expand vacant property schemes. Mr Dillon also expressed support for one-off houses in rural Ireland. “Fine Gael is committed to supporting once-off self-builds,” he said. The party’s candidate in Galway East, Niamh Madden, said an expansion of the living city initiative and the over-the-shop policy would go a “long way to” to support people seeking a home, while also maintaining the Government’s housing stock. Mr Harris defended the party’s housing record and charges that it would not be capable of delivering. “It’s a whole-of-Government issue,” he said. “It will fall to many more people than the housing minister. Why can people believe us? Because we are telling the truth. The people of Ireland know and will not be fooled by anybody. This country’s economy was crashed and the construction industry did not have a bob. There were ghost estates all over the place. “We have gone from 7,000 a year being built when I first became a TD to almost 40,000 this year.” He said that Fine Gael would “put its money where its mouth was” in terms of its plans. He accepted that there was a need to do more but defended what steps had been taken, including the provision of social homes. Mr Donohoe said the party was crucially aware of the issue of homelessness and said that the party wanted to introduce further measures to reduce the risk of people becoming homeless, with the expansion of one-bedroom units, and an expansion social housing tenant in situ programme. “It is the reason why we have increased the budget. It is a challenge and a crisis we are aware of and (to which) we are responding,” he said.",0,1
2024/11/11,"Simon Harris and Donald Trump agree to ‘keep in touch’ in call covering Middle East and Ukraine conflicts Taoiseach says he told US president-elect that the EU and the US need to work together on many issues  Taoiseach Simon Harris spoke to incoming US president Donald Trump in  a phone call on Monday when two men discussed the conflicts in the Middle East and  Ukraine. The Taoiseach congratulated Mr Trump on his victory in the US presidential election last week. It is understood they also discussed links between the  US and Ireland. Mr Trump, who owns a golf hotel in Doonbeg, Co Clare, will be inaugurated as US president on January 20th next year. Mr Harris later told reporters he had congratulated Mr Trump on his “clear election win”. He said he had wished Mr Trump well as he began the process of assembling his new team and the transition to a new administration. “We also agreed to keep in touch,” Mr Harris said. The Taoiseach said the US president-elect conveyed his best wishes to the people of Ireland. “We did discuss that Ireland is a good economic location and that Ireland’s economy is doing well. He spoke fondly of his experience in doing business in Ireland.” The Taoiseach said he told Mr Trump that the EU and the US needed to work together on so many issues – economic and humanitarian, and in bringing peace to the world. The Taoiseach said he had proposed in Brussels previously that there should be a EU-US trade summit. Mr Harris said his conversation with Mr Trump  lasted about 20 minutes. He said Mr Trump had spoken about visiting Ireland on several occasions previously and that he hoped to do so again. Senior Government leaders last week congratulated Mr Trump on his victory in the US  election, but the result was described as “devastating” and a “disaster” by Labour leader Ivana Bacik. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said: “We look forward to working with him and his new administration in a constructive manner, as we did during his previous administration.” President Michael D Higgins also wrote to Mr Trump, highlighting the close ties between the two countries. “As we begin the next century of diplomatic relations between our two countries, we will continue to build our relationship on the solid and mutually beneficial ground that our people have nurtured for the last 100 years,” the president wrote to Mr Trump. Mr Higgins identified food security, climate change and multiple international conflicts as pressing global issues. In 2019, in advance of a visit by Mr Trump to Ireland, the president criticised the then US president’s record on climate change as “regressive and pernicious”.",0,1
2024/11/19,"Fine Gael candidate John McGahon divides opinions in Dundalk over 2018 incident McGahon, found not guilty of assault causing harm to another man, has been endorsed by Taoiseach Simon Harris ‘on the basis of what happened in a court’ On Monday night, Fine Gael leader Simon Harris conceded on the Upfront Leader’s debate with Katie Hannon on RTÉ that he had not seen a video of the altercation involving general election candidate John McGahon and another man when he referred to it as “a scuffle”. The incident, which happened outside the Rum House pub in Dundalk in 2018, has now emerged as an election issue. Referring to the criminal case against Mr McGahon, who was found not guilty of assault causing harm to Breen White in the 2018 altercation, the leader of Fine Gael said he had backed Mr McGahon’s candidacy “on the basis of what happened in a court”. While the McGahon endorsement has generated considerable controversy, what do the locals in Dundalk make of it? Tom Brennan (60), who lives outside Dundalk, said Mr McGahon had gone through the court process and had been found not guilty. “The fact that the court found him not guilty is enough for me, it shouldn’t preclude him from running, but that doesn’t mean I’ll vote for him,” he said. Pat Murphy (68), from Ravensdale, felt the criminal case against Mr McGahon had been dealt with and was critical of how it had been portrayed. “It’s a witch hunt, he went before a court of law, that should be the end of it, he is a senator and he has a family,” he said. Pat said there is a considerable amount of support for Fine Gael in the Dundalk area. “There was his [Mr McGahon’s] uncle, Brendan McGahon, and Peter Fitzpatrick, who subsequently went Independent.” Others who declined to be named were more critical of Mr McGahon and of the Government. “I think he [Mr McGahon] should have got jail,” said one man, who was also critical of Government politicians whom he referred to as “gangsters, lining their own pockets”. “You can’t take the law into your own hands,” said another, for whom the cost of living is impacting his life considerably. “I’m having to work two jobs, my bills are €1,400 per month,” he said. For some young people in Dundalk, there is little interest in the controversy. Barney Blake (21), from Channonrock, said he wasn’t planning to vote. “I have no interest or knowledge on any of the parties,” he said. Oisin Brady-Cullen (18) of Dundalk was unaware of the McGahon controversy. “If more proof has come out and it wasn’t a case of self-defence it should go for a retrial,” said the criminology and psychology student.",0,1
2024/11/2,"New aircraft inspection system planned to prevent illegal transport of weapons through Ireland Proposed regime aimed at deterring airlines who may attempt to travel through Ireland with munitions without exemptions Plans for a system to allow for the inspection of flights that may be bringing weapons of war through Ireland are to go before Cabinet next week. The new system is designed to deter carriers from transporting munitions over Irish airspace or through Irish airports in breach of Irish law. It follows reports of large numbers of commercial flights carrying weapons through Irish airspace to the Israeli military over the last year. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan is to brief next Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting on a three-pronged approach devised by civil servants that will allow State agencies to “search, sample and sanction” airlines travelling through or over Ireland, a Government source said. As it stands, carriers must receive permission from the Government before bringing munitions through Irish airspace. The new regime will allow Irish officials to carry out random physical searches of aircraft landing in Ireland to ensure they are not carrying unauthorised weapons. This move will largely  affect flights from the US  stopping at Shannon Airport for refuelling. The use of Shannon by US military aircraft has long been controversial, particularly at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan when the US was frequently accused of illegally transporting weapons through Ireland. The Government has long insisted it has no power to search such flights. The new system will also allow officials to randomly sample the cargo manifests of aircraft flying over Ireland to ensure they are not carrying munitions. This will be a paper exercise and may be carried out before or after the flight has taken place, sources said. Lastly, severe sanctions are to be introduced for airlines found to be in breach of Irish legislation on the transit of weapons. The existing legislation makes it an offence to transport weapons through Ireland without permission but is unclear about how this should be enforced. Sources said it is hoped the new system will act as a deterrent for airlines who may attempt to travel through Ireland with munitions without the appropriate exemptions. Mr Ryan first committed to addressing the issue last May after Senator Alice Mary Higgins proposed a bill to restrict the transit of weapons of war to Israel and provide for an inspection system. He asked for a six-month pause to allow officials devise workable legislation. Officials are of the view that the current legislation, which dates from the 1970s, is out of date given world events and expansion of the air cargo business. If the proposal is approved by Cabinet, it will allow officials to begin drafting a new piece of air transport legislation codifying the inspection regime. However, the passage of the legislation will be a matter for the next government and subject to its approval. Meanwhile, the Department of Transport is continuing to investigate allegations, first reported by the Ditch website, of commercial airliners illegally transporting Israeli weapons over Ireland. The department previously confirmed nine such flights travelled through Irish airspace. It is continuing to examine a number of other flights.

2024/11/2,"The unravelling of a housing minister: Eoghan Murphy opens up about sleeping pills, manic running, anxiety and tears Interview: Murphy’s account of his failures (and failings) is candid, unforgiving, unfiltered and utterly brutal In spring 2019, the numbers staying in emergency accommodation topped 10,000 for the first time. Eoghan Murphy was minister for housing and had been in the job for less than two years. It was a seismic moment for the country and for him. The 10,000, he has written in his newly published memoir, Running From Office, was “a symbolic figure in terms of capturing my failure in the job. I picked up the phone to one of my brothers and asked him for help. It was time to resign.” Reading that passage, even as a seasoned political observer, is an eyebrow-arching moment. What is more astonishing is what happens next. Murphy had planned to give the taoiseach his resignation letter and go “straight to the airport to escape abroad, leaving the fallout behind”. He then found out his ex-girlfriend, with whom he had recently broken up, was pregnant. His exit plan was put on hold. For two weeks they came back together, but scans revealed the foetus was unviable. They split up again immediately. “I wasn’t capable of processing it,” he writes. “And it all just crashed down on top of me. So I selfishly went away to bury it all as deep down as I could. I drank for a week, recklessly, stupidly.” The subtitle of the book is Confessions of Ambition and Failure in Politics. Murphy’s account of his failures (and failings) as minister for housing is candid, unforgiving, unfiltered, and utterly brutal. So much so that at times, you feel like covering your eyes. Today, Murphy is at the other end of a video link. With a neatly trimmed beard, he looks fit, healthy and relaxed. He is in Tbilisi, Georgia, where he has been since early September as head of the OSCE election observation mission. This work has taken up much of his time since leaving politics. He loves it, he says. It is political. But it is not politics. It’s a far cry from the nadir of 2018 and 2019. In the book he describes his difficulties sleeping and how he went “prescription shopping” for sleeping pills “because one doctor would never give me enough”. He was hypersensitive to criticism, was racked with anxiety before any broadcast interview, would brood for months on even the smallest slight against him. He was consumed with guilt for not staying true to his values and becoming (in some ways) the politician he never wanted to be. He cried effusively when he told then taoiseach Leo Varadkar in 2020 that he no longer wanted to be a minister. At one of his lowest moments, during a trip to London, he got up in the middle of the night, went outside the flat where he had lived as a student, cried his eyes out, and then manically ran through the rain-sodden streets for hours. “I had let the criticisms bite too hard. I was panicking. I just couldn’t face it any more.” What happened to the idealistic young man whose rise reflected that of a new generation in Fine Gael under Varadkar? What happened to the man who led the “Five-a-side group” of backbenchers in Fine Gael and who pushed a reform agenda with the leadership? What happened to the junior minister who performed so well that Michael Noonan tipped him as a future minister for finance? What happened to the chief architect of Varadkar’s leadership campaign? The unravelling of all that occurred in the relatively short time he was minister for housing. All through his career as a politician, there was self-doubt and uncertainty. It came to a head in those three turbulent years. “There were some big mistakes or missteps that I made early on in housing. If I had done them properly, things might have happened more quickly and people might have more faith in what I was trying to do. People need to understand you have a plan ... but I wasn’t able to come out with my plan.” Early on Murphy wanted the housing situation to be declared an emergency (over-riding planning laws to get houses built quickly) and for the National Asset Management Agency (Nama) to have a role. He saw how effectively and quickly the State apparatus adjusted and adapted when there were other emergencies such as big weather events and Covid. But proposals were batted back. He and his advisers thought the ambitious targets in Rebuilding Ireland were not nearly achievable and would make him a hostage to fortune. The problem was, he could not come up with a cohesive alternative. There were big initiatives, for sure: the scrapping of the building height cap; the establishment of the Land Development Agency (now coming into its own); co-living (a bit of a disaster), and the first cost-rental homes. Home building started going in the right direction but other indicators did not. Was the pressure such that he was heading towards a serious breakdown? “One of my big failures is that I didn’t manage my personal health properly.” He says he did not want the book to be a standard political memoir but rather an honest account about his mistakes and their impact on him. “I found it very cathartic when I was writing it because I was really getting to grips with it from a mental health point of view, because it had been such a difficult period. I did not manage myself well, and things just accumulated on top, combined with not sleeping and stomach issues. Murphy did recover some of his mojo (a favourite Enda Kenny word) during 2019 and into 2020. But he still knew that he wanted to quit politics. “I didn’t really want to run in the 2020 election, but I felt if I resigned before the election, it would have been way too damaging for the party and for myself. I knew I was not staying afterwards and there was bad faith in that, I know.” He retained his seat after a difficult campaign. A homeless man suffered life-changing injuries when a mechanical digger removed a tent from the canal when he was sleeping in it. A poster of Murphy happened to be hanging nearby. He ended up being blamed by association. At the count centre he was confronted and chanted at by angry mobs. Fine Gael had a bad election and, momentarily, Murphy reconsidered his decision to quit because the party was going into opposition. But when government beckoned, it signalled the exit for him. That led to the tearful meeting with Varadkar where he said he wanted out. “I was just desperate to get out of the public eye. I really did not enjoy the attention that came with that, and it had really limited my world, to my workplace and my home.” He could not go to cafes or public places any more because it inevitably led to hostile confrontations. “It was now [at a stage] where I was questioning myself, and I was feeling like everything was attacked.” When he left politics, he figured he had to be gone-gone. “I knew if I needed to kind of get back to myself, I needed to get away for a while. That was part of the plan.” He went wholly off grid. “I went off all social media when I left Ireland. I didn’t delete my Twitter, but I just haven’t been in it. When I tweeted about the book coming out, I did the tweet and I deleted the app again. “I don’t follow the politics ... I wasn’t going to hang around or try to keep a toe in.” Life is in London now. He has headed election observation missions in Uzbekistan, Armenia, Italy and Georgia. He travels to Wales to do mountain running when he can. He is content. He stresses he has no regrets about his 12 years in politics. “I loved my time in politics, in the round,” he says. “It was a fantastic experience. It’s a great job and a huge privilege. Towards the end I basically got burnt out, and came to the end of my tether. I was very happy when I left. I’m very happy being a private citizen.” The book, which took him six months to write, was a necessary part of that. “This book isn’t about me trying to get back into politics or be a commentator. I just wanted to write it as a kind of final contribution, and leave it at that, continue along the way I’m going.” Running From Office: Confessions of Ambition and Failure in Politics is published by Eriu, £16.99",0,1
2024/11/2,"Ireland’s housing targets: Why a lack of revised goals has real consequences Builders and experts, frustrated by the wait and by politicians’ failure to fully understand demand for housing, say the absence of new targets has real consequences The setting of new housing targets by the Government is almost certain to run out of road before the election, falling victim to a combination of time and politics. Despite a commitment from the Taoiseach, resistance to setting targets from within Fianna Fáil means the clock is on the verge of running out – sparking a backlash from the construction industry. The episode, however, says a lot about the dying days of the Coalition – and what is to come in the election campaign. One senior Government figure said there is now a zero per cent chance the new targets will be agreed before the election. Tánaiste Micheál Martin this week downplayed the significance of agreed targets, arguing that the ESRI and others have published “ballpark” estimates of housing need. However, builders are not convinced. Far from being an abstract piece of political theatre, the publication of targets, they say, has consequences in the real world. It sets in train a cascading series of events around zoning, local authorities’ development plans and even central government assessing what policy interventions are needed to make sure targets are delivered. “This isn’t the elephant in the room, it’s the f***ing herd of elephants in the room,” says one large homebuilder, speaking privately. They added that while politicians may want to campaign on different housing platforms during an election, “in the meantime, it’s really difficult, everything grinds to a halt”. A second industry source concurs: “The whole system is in a state of stasis because it doesn’t know what it’s doing”. Home builder Michael O’Flynn, who sat on the Housing Commission, said it was “beyond comprehension” that new housing targets had not been announced. “Proper targets are absolutely essential for appropriate zoning and infrastructure planning. Instead we are getting delays and additional costs are being put on the sector, which is making things worse,” he said. Housing, inevitably, will be a central election battleground. The Government had set an initial target of 33,450 homes for this year but there is consensus current targets are dramatically lower than is needed for population growth. The Central Statistics Office reported 21,634 new homes being delivered to the end of September. The Green Party’s manifesto is expected to contain a target of 53,000 a year, based on the ESRI estimate. Sinn Féin has already rounded on the Government over its failure to set targets, accusing it of “running scared”. Fianna Fáil, meanwhile, is steadfast in its view that it can win the contest over credibility on housing during the election on a foundation of progress made to date and its manifesto commitments. “There will be an independent debate on housing as much as anything, that’s the realpolitik,” a Fianna Fáil minister said. The party has pushed messages about its record on housing out on its social media channels this week. However, asking voters to back it again based on its record when so many are still suffering from the acute impact of the housing crisis may be a dubious proposition. One senior Fine Gael source summarised the Fianna Fáil position as wanting to say it has fixed housing, but added: “Let’s be honest, if that’s the tactic, it will fall flat to people who don’t have their own house.” There is a frustration within Fine Gael over the refusal of their Coalition partners to set targets, which comes against a backdrop where they perceive Martin to be tetchy and irritated by Taoiseach Simon Harris. The same figure said the whole issue over setting of targets has been “an inordinate waste of time”. “We could have signed off last week and the system could have been ready whenever a new government is formed.” Senior Fianna Fáil sources contend the housing market is infinitely more complex than simply setting targets, arguing that signing up to new targets in the dying days of the Coalition just didn’t make sense. All of this politicking is part of a wider dance between the Coalition partners, trying to figure out how they can credibly criticise each other after governing together for five years, while also not damaging relations fundamentally – given their basic goal is to reform some version of the current Government. They must also try to control their own backbenchers and line ministers – which is likely to prove impossible across the board as Government TDs square off and draw on old tribal animosities with seats at stake. While there is undoubtedly an element of politics at play, Ministers also privately point to the fact that a review of the National Planning Framework (NPF) has not been completed. This complex piece of work effectively sets the top tier of planning policy – currently based on population growth seen during the census period 2011-2016, which was much lower than current growth, meaning a new NPF is needed. Without an updated NPF – which must be voted on by the Dáil – new housing targets would be something of a paper tiger – a political commitment without any teeth. “You can have a target but without a planning framework to underpin it, it’s not much of a target,” said one Cabinet member. The industry had been hoping for the NPF by the end of the month, but with nothing scheduled for discussion by the Dáil this week, that looks forlorn. Conor O’Connell, director of housing and planning with the Construction Industry Federation, says a new NPF is “critical” and that both it and housing targets are needed by the end of the year, calling for interim measures to address shortages of land already zoned and serviced with utilities in areas of high demand. “The sooner this process begins the better for future housing supply,” he said. The Government has this week pointed to housing commencement statistics that suggest a glut of new builds has entered into the process – although these figures are probably inflated by the fact that commencement notices had to be filed by the end of April in order to take advantage of development levy waivers, which were subsequently extended in any event. One large home builder worried privately that rather than a building boom coming down the tracks, without rapid enactment of new targets and a revised planning framework, “in the medium term housing output will fall off a cliff”. Housing experts also have an abiding frustration over the political system’s acceptance of the true underlying demand for new housing. Ronan Lyons, associate professor in economics at TCD and a member of the Housing Commission, says estimates should take into account a structural deficit in housing – homes that have not been built for people who need them, leaving them stranded. As the demographic profile of the country changes, housing needs change too, with new needs for those trapped in the parental home – or those ageing in outsize unsuitable homes. This stands in contrast to setting targets based on anticipated new demand entering the market each year, Lyons says. “The politicians focus a lot on the nurse and guard getting married and wanting to have kids, and that’s what they’re looking at when they think of housing demand,” he says. Including those trapped, effectively, in the parental home, would mean higher targets. “They have to get real about that, and the Housing Commission did its best to put numbers on it, but it doesn’t seem to have landed with the Government.” Last week, Ministers discussed a range of six scenarios for hitting an average of 50,000 homes a year – “some more realistic than others,” a Fianna Fáil source confided. The overall goal, one person involved in talks said, is to add about 4,500 a year to the current pace of construction, getting to more than 60,000 a year by 2030. This Government has taken its shot on housing, regardless of targets. Now, the battle between and among Coalition parties, and the Opposition, moves centre stage in the election campaign.",0,1
2024/11/21,"Road safety: Law change aimed at closing net on disqualified drivers delayed ‘Game-changer’ amendment will give gardaí ability to identify banned drivers who fail to surrender licences A “game-changer” amendment to road traffic legislation allowing gardaí to identify disqualified drivers on the spot has been delayed until next year. The regulation, which was due to come into effect on December 1st, marked the final step in a years-long effort to close the net on thousands of banned motorists still on the State’s roads. Gardaí currently have access to the Irish Motor Insurance Database (IMID) to help detect drivers operating without insurance on the roads. When the amendment is commenced, gardaí will have real-time access to driver numbers, allowing them to identify those who are disqualified. Motorists have a unique driver number, held for life, on their licence or learner permit. The delay, until March 31st next, is linked to the requirement for motorists to provide their driver number to insurers and brokers to renew their insurance. Insurers will not be permitted to issue a policy without the driver number of  everyone named on a policy. The numbers will be validated against the Department of Transport’s National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF). The Department of Transport said “industry representatives in October advised that a delay would be required” to complete changes to insurer IT systems in order to capture all driver numbers, “and to allow more time to communicate the new requirements to the public”. Insurance Ireland chief executive Moyagh Murdock said the “pragmatic approach was to defer the commencement date” for everyone “to ensure that both insurers’ IT platforms and those IT software platforms provided for use by brokers were ready on the same day”. Susan Gray, of the Parc road safety campaign group, said the organisation has been campaigning since 2011 for gardaí to get access to real-time information, not only on vehicles but on the driving licence and unique driver numbers of vehicle owners and drivers. She said that after 14 years of campaigning “come March, gardaí with their mobility devices can, through a car’s registration number, tell not only if the driver is uninsured but also disqualified. They will also know if any named driver on the insurance policy is disqualified.” Ms Gray said it was a “game-changer” but that it was essential “to ensure that this is done properly and that nobody slips the net”. Insurers gathering driver numbers follows unsuccessful efforts to oblige drivers prosecuted for road safety offences to surrender their licences to the courts, despite the legislation being commenced in October 2011 by then minister for transport Leo Varadkar. Parc monitored court cases and sent reports to the department and RSA. These showed that “people who were convicted of penalty-point offences were not presenting their licences in court to have their unique driver number recorded”, so their penalty points or disqualification could not be recorded, Ms Gray said. Between 9,000 and 10,000 drivers annually are disqualified in the courts, but just 3 per cent of learner drivers and fewer than 10 per cent of qualified motorists surrender their licence.",0,1
2024/11/21,"Paschal Donohoe had private undisclosed dinner with Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary No records were kept and no actions were taken arising from meeting, says Minister’s spokeswoman Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe held a private and previously undisclosed dinner meeting at an upmarket Dublin restaurant with Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary in February 2022. A spokeswoman for Mr Donohoe said it was a private dinner and that no business matters were discussed, and neither were matters of policy or regulation. It was not included in his ministerial diary – which his spokeswoman said is “used predominantly to log official events”. No records were kept as it was a private dinner, and no actions were taken arising from it, she said. When first contacted about whether Mr Donohoe had met Mr O’Leary by The Irish Times earlier this month, the Minister’s team did not disclose the dinner until after they were approached again with more information about its timing. Mr Donohoe’s spokeswoman said that the information was not supplied after this initial approach as it was a “dinner of a private nature”. The dinner took place in Delahunt, a fashionable restaurant in Dublin 2. It was attended by another unnamed person. “One other person was present at the dinner. We will not comment on who this is, respecting the privacy of the person in question,” Mr Donohoe’s spokeswoman said. Ryanair confirmed that Mr O’Leary had met Mr Donohoe for dinner in early February 2022. “This was a social dinner in a Dublin restaurant in the company of others. No Ryanair business or regulation as Min Donoghue (sic) has no responsibility for transport or tourism.” No lobbying return was made by Ryanair regarding the dinner. The airline said: “Since this was a social setting (in a public place) no lobbying took place and no lobbying return was required or necessary.” Under lobbying laws, not every contact between companies and politicians has to be logged to the State’s register for tracking lobbying. It only must be disclosed when a matter such as the development or changes to public policies are being discussed, or the preparation of amendments or laws, or the awards of grants, loans or similar matters involving public funds are on the agenda. Fine Gael faced a significant political backlash after comments made by Mr O’Leary at the launch of Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke’s campaign just after the general election was called. A video of his remarks that surfaced after the event showed he said he would not employ teachers “to go out and get things done”, saying that the Dáil was “full of teachers”. The outspoken aviation boss doubled down afterwards, saying he had been subjected to a pile-on. Ryanair was recently an outspoken critic of a limit put on traffic through Dublin Airport which would have seen a restriction on the number of aircraft landing slots next summer. Mr O’Leary made strong criticisms of Green Party Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan, who said he would not intervene in the planning system. A High Court ruling at the start of the month put a stay on the cap and prevented the imposition of slot restrictions.",0,1
2024/11/25,"Sinn Féin plan for affordable homes will meet lending requirements, Ó Broin says Plan ‘would provide banks with the exact same security as the current government schemes do’, says party’s housing spokesman Sinn Féin remains “absolutely confident” its affordable homes plan will meet the lending requirements of the banks, the party’s housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin has insisted. The party has pledged to deliver affordable housing for eligible purchasers at prices between €250,000 and €300,000. Under the Sinn Féin plan the State would retain ownership of the land the homes are built on and there would be conditions on the sale and rent of the property. Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have questioned whether lenders will provide mortgages to housebuyers who would not own the land. The Business Post reported at the weekend that banking sources have said Sinn Féin has overstated the banks’ willingness to lend mortgages under the proposed scheme. Mr Ó Broin responded on Monday saying that banks “don’t sign memoranda of understanding with Opposition parties and nor should they”. He said he and Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty met representative organisation the Banking & Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) prior to the publication of the party’s affordable housing plan. “They [BPFI] set out in very reasonable terms what their requirements would be if their members were to lend mortgages into our scheme. “Those requirements really centre around what would happen in the case of default. “And I’m absolutely confident, and make no apology for being confident, that we can meet those requirements.” Mr Ó Broin said Sinn Féin’s plan “would provide banks with the exact same security as the current government schemes do.” He said this means that “if somebody purchased one of our affordable purchase homes and then defaults on their mortgage, the banks will have first charge on the asset, including the land”. He added: “Also, because we want to ensure where people fall into mortgage distress through no fault of their own the local authorities would have an option, as they currently do under mortgage-to-rent, to step in, acquire out the mortgage and turn the affordable homeowner into a social or a cost-rental tenant. “Those types of securities already exist, and therefore, because we will be doing exactly the same thing as the current government, I don’t have any concerns.” Mr Ó Broin also said: “I would also remind people that banks lend into leasehold mortgages all the time. “Anybody living in a duplex, the people who live on the upper floors don’t own the land. “People who live in apartments, they don’t own the land. “For decades in this country, banks lend mortgages for leasehold purchases.” Mr Ó Broin added: “Given that people will be able to buy these homes at prices of €250,000, €260,000, €270,000 ... those affordable purchasers will be taking on far less risk because they borrowing less money.” He said this was in “stark contrast” to the outgoing Government’s affordable housing offering where he put the “all-in” cost of some of these homes in Dublin at between €400,000 and €560,000.",0,1
2024/11/26,"Former Government minister Gemma Hussey dies after short illness aged 86 Fine Gael ‘trailblazer’ served in three different ministerial portfolios during long career in politics Former government minister Gemma Hussey has died after a short illness. She was 86. Born in Bray, Co Wicklow, Ms Hussey had a successful career in business before entering politics. She became a senator, initially as an independent, in 1977 and joined Fine Gael three years later. In 1981 she became government leader in the Seanad She was elected to the Dáil as a candidate for the party in 1982 and served as a TD until 1989. During that time she was minister for education (1982-1986), minister for social welfare (1986-1987) and for a brief period in 1987, minister for labour. Paying tribute to Ms Hussey, Taoiseach Simon Harris described her as “a trailblazer, the State’s first female minister for education and Fine Gael’s first female Cabinet minister”. “Gemma was a passionate progressive for women’s rights, education reform and Ireland’s place in the world, particularly the potential of European Union membership,” he said. “Gemma was a TD in my own native Wicklow, where her long service and delivery is remembered to this day. But above all, Gemma was a patriot, a Fine Gael stalwart and a kind and generous person. I was one of the lucky people to enjoy her company, her advice and her good humour.” In a statement announcing the news on Tuesday, her family said her “passion throughout her life was the advancement of women in politics and in all walks of life”. “She was a very proud Europhile and after exiting politics in 1989 she immersed herself in the European Women’s Federation, encouraging women in former Eastern-block countries to become active in politics for the first time.” She died surrounded by her family, they said. Ms Hussey was predeceased by her husband Derry, who died in 2020, and is survived by her children, Rachel, Ruth and Andrew, her seven grandchildren and her brother Paddy.",0,1
2024/11/27,"Mairead McGuinness to take up non-profit role during EU ‘cooling off’ period Outgoing Irish commissioner gets clearance for unpaid role with ‘inspirational’ European Forum Alpbach As she leaves her role as a European commissioner this week, much has been made about what Fine Gael’s Mairead McGuinness might do next. There had been some talk of the former MEP fighting for a Dáil seat in the recent general election, but that did not materialise. The main point of speculation surrounding Ms McGuinness’ future is whether she has her eye on the Áras and a run for the presidency next year. In the meantime Ms McGuinness has got approval to take up an unpaid role with European Forum Alpbach, a non-profit organisation based in Austria that runs talks and “inspirational” events. The organisation describes its annual forum in the picturesque Austrian town of Alpbach as a coming together that opens “minds and souls for Europeʼs future”. The European Commission has strict rules governing where former commissioners can work during a two-year “cooling off” period, to avoid the perception of a revolving door between the top of the EU’s executive arm and private companies or lobbyists. Earlier this year The Irish Times reported how former trade commissioner Phil Hogan’s consultancy work for DLA Piper, an international law firm, risked falling foul of these rules. An independent EU ethics committee felt the work could damage the reputation of the commission, leading Mr Hogan to drop the law firm as a client, until the end of the cooling off period. Ms McGuinness has served as EU commissioner for financial services since late 2020, taking over Ireland’s seat at the table after Mr Hogan resigned in the wake of the Golfgate scandal during the Covid-19 pandemic. Outgoing commissioners are paid a portion of their basic annual salary of about €310,000 for a period after leaving office. Having served for four of the five year commission term, EU rules indicate Ms McGuinness would be entitled to be paid half of her monthly commission salary, for the next two years. This week MEPs voted to approve the next commission led by Ursula von der Leyen, meaning former Fianna Fáil minister Michael McGrath officially starts work as Ireland’s next EU commissioner. Documents show Ms McGuinness sought clearance from the EU body to accept a role as co-chair of European Forum Alpbach’s “strategic advisory council”, when her term finished. In October 15th correspondence, Ms McGuinness told commission officials the position on the forum’s advisory board was “non-remunerated”. The Co Louth politician said she would have no role in advocating for funding for the organisation. In a November 26th decision, the commission said there was no conflict between the role and restrictions put on former commissioners. The decision said the board position “does not present any risk of incompatibility” and did not require a full assessment by the ethics committee. It added that during the two-year cooling off period Ms McGuinness should refrain from lobbying commissioners or commission staff on behalf of the European Forum Alpbach.",0,1
2024/11/3,"Tánaiste describes as ‘silly’ reports of Fine Gael briefings about age difference with Simon Harris ‘It is quite amusing on one level but I would say to people to cop on a bit’, says Micheál Martin Tánaiste and leader of Fianna Fáil Micheál Martin has described as “silly” briefings that he is “tetchy” and drawing attention to the difference in age between him and the Taoiseach Simon Harris. Responding to reporters questions, Mr Martin said the tendency to raise the issue that “Micheál is getting tetchy” had begun on the Ivan Yates radio show. Then, later, in the Sunday Times, senior Fine Gael sources were quoted as saying “I am getting tetchy”. “It is quite amusing on one level but I would say to people to cop on a bit,” he said. “It is silly.” Asked if his saying in a media interview that he was more focused on substance that soundbites was a reference to Mr Harris, the Tánaiste said it was a comment on his approach to politics “which is one of substance.” “There can be a tendency in modern politics towards the headlines, towards the very superficial approach, but I take the approach that in Government we are there to deliver as best we can for the people.” Mr Martin was speaking to reporters after delivering his oration at the annual Fianna Fáil Wolfe Tone commemoration in Bodenstown, Co Kildare, during which he contrasted the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil records on housing. “Ireland missed years because of past failures,” he said. “As the former Fine Gael housing minister Eoghan Murphy bravely said, in the previous government, radical reforms were blocked in favour of a narrow focus on smaller actions. “Well, we changed when we took over responsibility for housing. Over the past four and a half years we have implemented a relentless programme of reforms and developing new actions.” Mr Martin also contrasted his party’s approach with that of Sinn Féin. “There was “deep division on housing in this election – between our programme of supporting people who want to buy a home and an opposition which wants to slash aid for homebuyers because of their ideological opposition to aiding home buyers.” When speaking to reporters, Mr Martin said Mr Murphy, in media interviews, had spoken of how he was “held back” as minister for housing. There can be resistance in the political system and in the public service, Mr Martin said, “to certain models of approach, and the market hadn’t worked ... that was clear.” For the past four years, he said, there has been “a much stronger state intervention in housing”. During his oration Mr Martin said a commitment to increased funding for the Shared Island Initiative would be included in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. “We are determined to push forward, to build on the momentum which is finally developing. We will add at least another €1 billion to the Shared Island Initiative and take its work to a completely new level, building lasting links and helping communities to overcome the disastrous legacies of sectarianism and violence,” he said. Other issues in the manifesto would include addressing the rising cost of living, helping families and pensions “in every budget in a progressive and sustainable way”, and addressing the structural issues that cause high prices, including high energy prices. Mr Martin said Wolfe Tone had understood that it was only through a secure place in the European Community of nations that Ireland could be sovereign and secure. “This is a lesson which others who call themselves republican have never understood. Their knee-jerk Euroscepticism must be confronted, and it must be stopped from diverting Ireland away from its European path.” When speaking to reporters, Mr Martin said he had discussed the publication of the National Planning Framework with the Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and would be raising the issue with the leaders of the Coalition parties. He would like to see the document published before the election, he said. This would “give a menu for debate”.",0,1
2024/11/3,"Government will reject opposition attempts to progress Occupied Territories Bill Micheál Martin due to address Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee this week to outline need for extensive amendments to the proposed legislation The Government will reject opposition offers of Dáil time to progress the Occupied Territories Bill before the Dáil is dissolved. The controversial Bill, which would ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, has been stalled at the Government’s behest for several years – but was recently unblocked, clearing the way for it to progress through the legislative process. Senior Government sources, however, say that will not happen this side of an election, despite opposition offers to make Dáil time available this week. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin is due to address the Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee this week to outline the continuing difficulties with the Bill, and the need for extensive amendments. Opposition parties are likely to push for Dáil time for the Bill this week, offering to give up their Private Members’ time to progress the legislation, but the Government will insist that necessary amendments are not yet drafted. Without Government co-operation there is no chance of the Bill being progressed until after the general election – widely expected to be called this week with the dissolution of the Dáil on Thursday or Friday. Independent Senator Frances Black, who introduced the Bill, said she would love to see it passed before the election is called, and thinks it is possible with the right political will. The Social Democrats said that they would proceed with a motion on Gaza, though that is likely to be unopposed by the Government. All Bills that are not concluded automatically fall when the Dáil is dissolved, though it would be open to the next Government and the next Dáil to restore the bill to the order paper. Successive governments have blocked the Bill since 2018, citing constitutional and EU law difficulties. However, since a ruling by the International Court of Justice on the occupied territories last summer, the Government has decided that the political and legal context has changed sufficiently to allow the Bill to be reconsidered. In a statement released last week, the Government said “the advisory opinion found that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territory is unlawful and should be brought to an end as rapidly as possible. “It further addressed the duty on all states not to render any aid or assistance in maintaining that situation. In particular, the court stated that all states have a duty to distinguish in dealings with Israel between its own territory and the OPT [occupied Palestinian territories].” In reality, despite the late moves, this will be an issue for the next Government to decide on. However, there remains substantial unease in Government about proceeding with the Bill given likely opposition from the United States, both politically and commercially. Israel is strongly critical of the bill. Ambassador Dana Erlich, who left Ireland earlier this year following the State’s formal recognition of a Palestinian state, said the proposed Bill is “a discriminatory attempt that aims to target Israel”.",0,1
2024/11/4,"New housing target to be set at average of 50,500 homes a year Minister for Housing brings revised draft of national planning framework to Coalition leaders for approval The Coalition is to agree new housing targets averaging 50,500 new homes per year during the lifetime of the next government. It marks a sudden reversal on the issue, which had been bogged down amid expectations that the targets would not be agreed before the general election. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien brought a revised draft of the national planning framework (NPF), a key document outlining the implementation of housing targets, to Coalition leaders on Monday evening. The full Cabinet is expected to agree to the targets outlined in the updated draft plan on Tuesday, which envisages 303,000 homes being built from 2025-2030. Coalition leaders agreed to a 41,000 home target for next year, rising to 43,000 homes in 2026, 48,000 in 2027, 53,000 in 2028, 58,000 in 2029 and 60,000 in 2030. While the Coalition is only expected to agree to targets to 2030, it is understood that the NPF provides a basis for building an average of 54,000 homes annually to 2040. The NPF provides the pathway to the targets by informing local area development plans and zoning around the country. While the Cabinet decision on Tuesday will mark a political agreement underpinning the targets, the final NPF will not be adopted until the next Dáil is elected — as it requires further environmental screening and then a Dáil vote. A Government source said it expected the housing targets to be adopted fully by the three Coalition parties in their election manifestos. It marks a reversal from last week when senior Coalition sources believed there was effectively zero chance of agreeing new targets before the Dáil is dissolved after Fianna Fáil indicated it did not favour locking them in before the election. That in turn led to a backlash from some in the construction sector, who argued that the setting of targets was a key step in providing a signal to the wider public sector that in turn would encourage zoning decisions and provide momentum for housebuilders. In comments at the weekend, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin indicated that his position was softening and that if the planning framework could be published he was “open to a set of figures”. One Fine Gael source described this as a “climbdown” after it was reported that Fianna Fáil wanted to campaign on housing during the general election on a stand-alone basis, rather than a joint platform with the rest of the Coalition. Against that, Fine Gael leader Simon Harris had been clear that he wanted the targets agreed before going to the country. A Fianna Fáil source said the party was pleased the new targets had been agreed. A revised draft of the NPF — updated from a version which was published during the summer — will be released in the coming days, it is understood.",0,1
2024/11/4,"Green Party to promise new migration agency to overhaul approach to asylum seekers Party’s election manifesto to propose new body called the Asylum and Integration Agency which would bring together functions carried out by existing agencies The Green Party is to make a general election promise of a new migration agency to overhaul the State’s approach to managing asylum seekers and people fleeing the Ukraine war. The manifesto pledge, which will be detailed in the party’s pre-election launch, comes after almost three years of surging migration which has put the State’s existing systems – and party leader Roderic O’Gorman – under unprecedented pressure. The dedicated agency would take over day-to-day handling of the migration response, as distinct from the current approach which has been run out of Mr O’Gorman’s Department of Integration. The concept has been discussed at a high level by officials and within Government for months – but the current Coalition has failed to get it off the ground. In a statement, a spokesman for Mr O’Gorman confirmed that the party will call for a new migration agency to be established in its election manifesto. “The party believes that the current system is in need of reform, with a more co-ordinated, better-resourced approach to migration in Ireland.” The new body would be called the Asylum and Integration Agency, and would bring together functions currently carried out by the International Protection Office and the International Protection Accommodation Service working alongside the Garda National Immigration Bureau. There would be input from other departments closely involved in managing the response, as well as local authorities and civil society groups, according to the Greens. It would be responsible for day-to-day processing of applications as well as the procurement and management of accommodation for international protection applicants – which has massively expanded in recent years in response to the crisis. The Government has a plan to expand the State-owned portfolio of migrant accommodation, but currently has a largereliance on the private sector. It has faced criticism over the absence of a joined-up approach to providing accommodation – with strident pockets of protest against new centres fanned by far-right actors, on occasion leading to clashes with gardaí. In April, the Cabinet was told that work was beginning to examine the feasibility of establishing a migration accommodation agency, following a scoping exercise undertaken in 2023. The Government believes it will have to deal with between 13,000 and 16,000 asylum seekers coming to Ireland annually, four times what it had planned for in a previous strategy to dismantle the direct provision system. Ministers have been told that the State will spend €5 billion in the coming decades providing accommodation in State-owned properties – although this would be significantly cheaper than sourcing beds in the private sector. Meanwhile, the Government may approve the new National Planning Framework when it meets on Tuesday for what is expected to be its last meeting before the general election is called at the end of this week. Senior sources in Fine Gael and the Green Party said they wanted to see the framework – considered necessary for ambitious new housing targets to be set – agreed. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin told the Sunday Independent that he wanted to see the new framework published.",0,1
2024/11/4,"Micheál Martin dismisses Fine Gael accusations he is ‘tetchy’ Weekend exchanges come as politicians prepare to return to Leinster House this week for what is widely expected to be the final days of the current Dáil Tánaiste and leader of Fianna Fáil Micheál Martin dismissed negative briefings about him which he said were coming from Fine Gael, as tensions between the two Coalition partners rise in advance of the expected calling of the general election later this week. Speaking at his party’s annual Wolfe Tone commemoration at Bodenstown, Co Kildare, yesterday, Mr Martin described as “silly” briefings that he is “tetchy” and drawing attention to the difference in age between him and the Taoiseach Simon Harris. Responding to reporters’ questions, Mr Martin said the tendency to raise the issue that “Micheál is getting tetchy” had begun on the Ivan Yates radio show. Then, later, in the Sunday Times, senior Fine Gael sources were quoted as saying “I [Martin] am getting tetchy”. “It is quite amusing on one level but I would say to people to cop on a bit,” he said. “It is silly.” Asked if his saying in a media interview that he was more focused on substance that soundbites was a reference to Mr Harris, the Tánaiste said it was a comment on his approach to politics “which is one of substance”. “There can be a tendency in modern politics towards the headlines, towards the very superficial approach, but I take the approach that in government we are there to deliver as best we can for the people.” Mr Martin contrasted the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil records on housing, saying “Ireland missed years because of past failures.” “As the former Fine Gael housing minister Eoghan Murphy bravely said, in the previous government, radical reforms were blocked in favour of a narrow focus on smaller actions. “Well, we changed when we took over responsibility for housing. Over the past 4½ years we have implemented a relentless programme of reforms and developing new actions,” he said. But speaking on RTÉ’s The Week in Politics, Minister of State for Europe Jennifer Carroll-MacNeill said Mr Martin was wrong to claim credit for the Land Development Agency, which she said had been set up and capitalised by the former housing minister Eoghan Murphy. The weekend exchanges come as politicians prepare to return to Leinster House this week for what is widely expected to be the final days of the current Dáil. It is understood that the three leaders have not yet agreed when the election will be called or what the polling date will be, though it is widely expected that the Taoiseach will ask President Michael D Higgins to dissolve the Dáil on either Thursday or Friday of this week, with polling set for Friday, November 29th. There are a number of critical Bills which must be passed by the Dáil this week, including the Finance Bill, all of which are likely to be guillotined. Mr Harris is due to attend a meeting of European Union leaders in Budapest on Thursday evening and Friday morning, at which they will discuss the result of this week’s US presidential election and its implications for the EU. According to a person centrally involved in the process, this means Mr Harris will call an election on either Thursday morning before he leaves for Budapest or, more likely, on Friday afternoon when he returns.",0,1
2024/11/4,"Michael McGrath needs to be ‘un-Irish’ in EU role, says European Greens leader Former minister faces confirmation hearing in European Parliament on Tuesday for role of commissioner for justice and the rule of law Michael McGrath will have to shake off the stereotype of the polite, “friendly” Irish man if he is to do well as European commissioner for justice and the rule of law, the co-leader of the European Greens party has said. Mr McGrath is to face a Confirmation hearing in the European Parliament on Tuesday morning, where a committee of MEPs will question him on his suitability for the EU commissioner job. The former Fianna Fáil minister for finance is in line to take over the commission brief covering justice, consumer protection and the rule of law. The role would see him lead the European Commission’s efforts to chastise Hungary for the continued erosion of rights and backsliding on the rule of law by prime minister Viktor Orban’s rightwing populist government. Speaking on Monday, Terry Reintke, co-leader of the European Greens grouping in parliament, said given Mr McGrath’s background, it was not obvious that he should be the politician in charge of the justice and rule of law portfolio. “I think that obviously there is a case to be made that we should really check in the hearing whether he is up for the task and ready to do it,” she said. Ms Reintke, a German MEP, said the next commissioner for justice needed to push through stronger penalties for Hungary, which were currently being blocked in the EU policymaking machine by other countries. “I would say that in order to do that he will maybe have to be a little bit un-Irish – I don’t know if this is a stereotype that is shared across Europe – but Irish people are considered to be very polite and friendly quite often, and I think he will have to be rather tough,” she said. The hearing in the European Parliament will last for three hours, where Mr McGrath is scheduled to take questions from more than 40 MEPs from different political groups. Fine Gael MEP Regina Doherty and Independent MEP Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan are among those due to question the incoming Irish commissioner. Afterwards a committee of MEPs will vote on whether to confirm Mr McGrath’s appointment to the EU job, with a two-thirds majority required for him to pass initially. If Mr McGrath does not get a two-thirds majority, MEPs can request further responses to written questions or hold a second hearing. MEPs can also opt for a second vote, where a commissioner only needs a simple majority to pass. The European Parliament traditionally rejects at least one commissioner, and five years ago three failed to clear the hurdle. The nominees from Hungary, Italy and Belgium are seen as being vulnerable in the coming hearings. However, there is a greater hesitancy among the main political groupings about voting down others this time, for fear commissioners from their groups will be rejected in retaliation. In the first of the hearings on Monday, Maroš Šefčovič, who is nominated to be the EU’s next trade commissioner, said any change to the bloc’s trade agreement with Israel would need the unanimous support of all 27 member states. Mr Šefčovič, the longtime commissioner from Slovakia, was responding to a question from Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan, who said it had “never been clearer” that Israel had breached clauses in the agreement to uphold human rights when it “levelled” Gaza. The EU had used the trade agreement as a platform to have “frank and tough conversations” with the Israeli government to push for a ceasefire in the Middle East, Mr Šefčovič said. Ms Boylan said the response was “not good enough” and showed up the EU’s “double standard” in how it had “rightly” sanctioned Russia and the lack of similar measures taken against Israel.",0,1
2024/11/5,"Harris and Martin block Green proposals for €3bn Climate and Nature fund Coalition partners say it was premature for Minister of the Environment to earmark money to specific areas without consultation A Green Party memo which would outline how the €3 billion Climate and Nature Fund would be allocated was blocked by Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin in advance of being brought to Cabinet. In sign of increasing tension between the Coalition partners in the run-up to the announcement of a general election, the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil leaders would not allow the memo to proceed for approval at the meeting of Ministers on Tuesday. Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan had proposed to deliver an outline plan on how the money would be earmarked for various climate action measures including new clean energy projects, retrofitting, insulating, biomethane, efficiencies, networks and infrastructure. However, it is understood Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil took the view that the memo was “premature” and that the decision making on how the funds should be used would be a whole of Government one, rather than one made by a single department. It was suggested by the two other parties that other Government departments would have been keen to come up with proposals and that more consultation was required. The Green Party argued, however, that it was more important for the Government to set out its stall in advance of the election. Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Ossian Smyth said he was “acutely disappointed” by the decision. “We’re surprised they are dragging their heels on this,” the Green Party TD said. “They didn’t want this on the Cabinet agenda even though they knew this was coming for a long time. “Everyone knows that failing to meet our emission reduction targets will leave us open to billions of euros of EU fines so any delay could cost the State money,” he said. The fund had been established by Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath, when he was minister for finance. The Green Party plan proposed spending hundreds of millions of euro on retrofitting public sector buildings such as hospitals, schools, leisure centres and universities. It also proposed a scheme to help private companies become more energy efficient. Other proposals included making district heating available in regions where there was significant industry. This is where waste heat from large industries could be used to heat homes and public buildings through a network of underground pipes. Other projects earmarked included biomethane projects in rural Ireland infrastructure to support offshore wind energy, and microgeneration. Separately, Mr Ryan updated Ministers at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting on plans for the updating of domestic legislation around the carriage of munitions of war on civil aircraft. The Department of Transport is to consult with the Department of Foreign Affairs with a view to giving the State the power to “search, sample and sanction” any flights that could potentially be carrying weapons through or over Ireland. Meanwhile, Tánaiste Mícheál Martin received Cabinet approval for the continued provision of up to 30 permanent Defence Forces personnel as part of the EU Military Assistance Mission in support of Ukraine, until November 2026. The mission, which began in November 2022 as part of the EU’s response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine, provides specialised training to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, with 60,000 Ukrainian soldiers trained so far. The Defence Forces have delivered a total of 15 training modules in combat lifesaving, demining, drill instruction, basic training and junior leadership for 734 Ukrainian personnel. The costs of this training from April 2023 to date is about €1m.",0,1
2024/11/5,"Appointment of first full ambassador from Palestine approved by Government Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid to become full envoy after carrying out role of ‘ambassador — head of mission’ The Government has approved the appointment of the Republic of Ireland’s first full ambassador from Palestine, Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, giving effect to the decision in May for the Republic to recognise the Palestinian state. Formal diplomatic relations between the Republic and the state of Palestine were established on September 29th of this year through an exchange of diplomatic notes. Last month,  the government of the state of Palestine formally notified the Department of Foreign Affairs of its intention to change Palestine’s representation here to a resident embassy under the Vienna Convention. It had been represented in the Republic by the Palestinian mission, headed by Dr Wahba Abdalmajid who carried out the role of “ambassador — head of mission”. The upgrade in status of the Palestinian mission to that of a resident embassy means that the diplomatic mission will now enjoy the full range of privileges and immunities applicable under the Vienna Convention. Ireland is also due to have its presence in Ramallah in the West Bank upgraded from a representative office to a full embassy. Following recognition of the state of Palestine by Ireland,  Spain and Norway in May, ambassadors from the three European countries were summoned to  the Israeli foreign affairs ministry. The diplomats were shown a previously unaired video of the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th last year in a move that was criticised sharply at the time by Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin. Following recognition of the Palestinian state, Israel’s government recalled its ambassador to Dublin Dana Erlich  “for consultations” and has said subsequently that she will not return until relations between the two states improve substantially. The Israeli government has criticised Irish Government positions and statements as “unfriendly and not in the spirit of bilateral co-operation”.  The souring in diplomatic relations between the two has also been marked by a spat between President Michael D Higgins and Israel after he accused the country of distributing a letter he sent congratulating the new president of Iran following his election. Israel also recalled its ambassador to Norway and threatened to recall its ambassador from Spain after they recognised Palestine.  The Irish Government  has indicated its intention to progress legislation banning trade in goods sourced from illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied territories — although only once it has substantially been amended as it is not in accordance with EU law, nor with the Irish Constitution, according to advice from Attorney General Rossa Fanning. The Republic has also said it would no longer award contracts for military goods to Israeli arms companies, but the Coalition has stopped short of expelling Israel’s ambassador despite calls from the Opposition to do so, citing the importance of keeping diplomatic channels open.",0,1
2024/11/5,"Former RTÉ broadcaster David Davin-Power ‘showed bravery to the bitter end’, son tells funeral Mass Former RTÉ northern editor and political correspondent died last weekend after short illness The late David Davin-Power was an intelligent and consummate broadcaster, a great storyteller but also a loyal family man and dear friend to many, his funeral mass has been told. The funeral of Mr Davin-Power, RTÉ's former political correspondent and Northern editor, who died last week at the age of 72, was held on Tuesday at the Church of St Vincent de Paul in Marino. In a tribute to the late broadcaster, known by all who knew him as DDP, his friend and former RTÉ colleague Bryan Dobson praised his eloquence as a broadcaster, the quality and depth of his analysis, and his ability to coin a phrase that “just summed up a situation”. “DDP was the best of company. His conversation sparkled; it was witty, informed, opinionated and wide-ranging,” he told the congregation. “He was the only journalist I know who regularly quoted from the classics, frequently in the original Latin, showing the benefits of a Jesuit education and a well-furnished mind. “Indeed, such was his intelligence and the breath of learning that David could have had any career he chose. But he chose journalism and it was the great benefit of Irish journalism that he did so.” Mr Dobson said Mr Davin-Power was also immensely proud of his family, his wife Dearbhla Collins, and his five children: Emily, Ben, Julia, Caroline and Nick, along with his grandchildren  with whom he was “besotted”. His extended family were the chief mourners at the Mass, at which the chief celebrant was Fr Bernard Treacy SJ, assisted by Fr Thomas Noone, PP, and Fr Patrick Greene SJ. Immediately after the communion, Ms Collins, a renowned pianist, accompanied mezzo-soprano Tara Erraught, who sang Allerseelen by Richard Strauss as a tribute to her husband. There was a sustained round of applause from the congregation. The funeral mass was attended by the President Michael D Higgins, his aide-de-camp Col Stephen Howard, as well as Commandant Claire Mortimer, aide-de-camp of Taoiseach Simon Harris, who attended on his behalf. Mr Davin-Power’s son, Nick, said that in his final illness his father had shown grace, good humour and “bravery to the bitter end.” He recalled that as children living in Belfast, Mr Davin-Power had shielded them from the “darker side” of the Troubles, once scrubbing off sectarian graffiti from a wall at their home before they could see it. When president Bill Clinton was introduced to his father in 1998, he asked him how long he had been in Northern Ireland. Nick said his father had replied: “Six years Mr President and all for something I did not do.” His daughter, Caroline Davin-Power, told the congregation that her father was “omnipresent in all our lives”. She said in the last few difficult weeks of his illness he told her the “luckiest thing that can happen to a man is to have a family”. Among the large congregation who attended the funeral were former taoiseach Bertie Ahern; Richard Bruton TD; former TD Finian McGrath; former senator Donie Cassidy; Senator Michael McDowell; former TD Alex White; former senator Maurice Manning; former senator Lorraine Higgins; photographer Charlie Collins; former economic journalist Brendan Keenan; PR executive Stephen O’Byrne; PR executive Richard Moore; academic Jacqueline Hayden; former Irish ambassador to the US Dan Mulhall; former editor of the Evening Press Dick O’Riordan; senior counsel Paul O’Higgins; former chief justice Frank Clarke; former film censor John Kelleher; and secretary general of the Department of Health Robert Watt. Many of his colleagues from RTÉ, and other broadcasters, attended including RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst; journalist David McCullagh; former director of news Ed Mulhall; Áine Lawlor; Paul Reynolds; Carole Coleman; Paul Cunningham; Marty Whelan; Dónal Byrne; Seán O’Rourke; Joe Duffy; Ray Burke; Fiona Mitchell; Cathy Grieve; Mark Little; Margaret Ward; Michael O’Kane; Shane McElhatton; Eileen Dunne; Joe Little; and Shane Harrison. There were many former colleagues from the Leinster House political gallery including Stephen Collins; John Lee; Fiach Kelly; Senan Molony; Tim Ryan; Gene McKenna; Deaglán de Bréadún; Miriam Lord; and Daniel McConnell. The other musicians who performed at the Mass were pianist Dearbhla Brosnan; violinists Michael d’Arcy and Mia Cooper; cellist Ailbhe McDonagh; and Robin Panter on viola.",0,1
2024/11/5,"Ireland will work with whomever wins US presidential election, Taoiseach and Tánaiste say Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman earlier said victory for Donald Trump would be ‘disaster’ Ireland will work with whomever wins the presidential election in the United States, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have stressed, as they stopped short of saying whether they agreed with Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman that a victory by Donald Trump would be a “disaster”. The race between former US president Mr Trump and the current vice-president Kamala Harris is too close to call as voters go to the polls across the US today. On Monday Green Party leader and Minister for Children and Integration Roderic O’Gorman said Mr Trump’s re-election would be “a disaster for the US, Ireland and the planet”. Speaking to reporters in advance of Cabinet, Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin did not say if they agreed with Mr O’Gorman. Mr Martin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said the Government “really have to not embroil ourselves in the election”. Asked if Mr O’Gorman should have commented at all on the election, Mr Harris said “anyone can comment in this democracy”. He said: “While I have very strong views on the US presidential election, and very personal views as to what I’d like to see happen, I’m very conscious as Taoiseach of the country not to interfere in an election in another country. “I wouldn’t appreciate if former president Trump or vice-president Harris started to tell people in Ireland who to vote for and I don’t think people in Ireland would appreciate that either so it’s entirely a matter for people in the United States today. I wish the candidates well.” He added that it will be a “consequential election” and “who sits in the Oval Office does matter” but said Ireland has shown “an ability to work with administrations of all political backgrounds over the years. Of course we’ll continue to do that whoever wins the election.” The Fine Gael leader said that “in a broad sense” it is “time for continued focus on multilateralism”. “We need both the US and the European Union involved in major issues including trying to bring peace to the Middle East, including supporting Ukraine, including issues around climate and of course trade policy between the US and the EU and the US and Ireland matters a lot to this country as well. “So let’s see what happens after the people of the United States vote.” Mr Martin said Ireland would work with “all administrations irrespective of their political positioning, so we work on both sides of the aisle”. He said: “We all have our views as politicians and political parties but the Government has to be Government and has to behave like a Government and in my view we really have to not embroil ourselves in the election.”",0,1
2024/11/5,"Michael McGrath confirmed in EU commissioner role by MEP vote  MEPs vote to approve McGrath appointment to EU commissioner for justice role following hearing   Michael McGrath has said he will not hesitate to pull up governments in EU countries found to be undermining the rule of law, in his new role as European commissioner for justice. A committee of MEPs in the European Parliament voted to confirm Mr McGrath’s appointment to the EU job on Tuesday following a three-and-a-half hour hearing. Mr McGrath is set to take over the commission brief covering justice, consumer protection and the rule of law. The role would see him lead the European Commission’s efforts to take on countries like Hungary, over the continued erosion of rights and rule of law by prime minister Viktor Orban’s right-wing populist government. Addressing the parliamentary hearing, Mr McGrath said he would be an “honest broker”, but national governments could not be allowed to take an “a la carte” approach when choosing when to follow EU laws. “Nobody should be under any illusions, I will be prepared to act in a strong and forthright way to ensure the rule of law is respected by every member state,” he said. As justice commissioner, Mr McGrath said he would push through plans to tie future EU funding to adherence to democratic and civil society norms and rules. “There will be tensions of course, there will be differences of opinion with member states ... We are seeing a deterioration in too many instances, we have to reverse that trend,” he said. “We are seeing slippage and we are seeing backsliding, we are seeing rule-of-law concerns, not just in one country or two countries.” Tineke Strik, a Dutch Green MEP, said the commission needed to take more concrete action when member states were found to be going backwards on that front. Mr McGrath said he agreed there needed to be more “follow-through” by the EU executive, and that he did not want his job to be limited to an “endless cycle of report writing”. The former  Fianna Fáil minister for finance said he would also bring forward a Digital Fairness Act that would tackle misleading advertising by social media influencers and apps with “harmful” addictive features. Politicians needed to “ask questions” about whether the sphere of online influencers needed more oversight, he said.  Products such as vaping products and procedures such as plastic surgery were being presented to children by influencers, he said. Mr McGrath said the proposed EU legislation would address the practice of businesses making online subscriptions difficult for customers to cancel. There was also a need for more powers at EU level to investigate faulty products, given online shopping platforms were “flooding” the European market with products that did not meet the bloc’s safety standards, he said. During the hearing, Mr McGrath was questioned by Fabrice Leggeri, an MEP from Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party in France, who criticised the European Court of Justice as undermining the democratic “will of the people” in countries. Mr McGrath pushed back against the criticism of the EU court, drawing a round of applause from MEPs. “We have a good system of checks and balances in place, we have to accept the primacy of EU law,” he told Mr Leggeri. He said he would bring forward a “comprehensive” plan to tackle corruption across the 27 member states and would strengthen the operation of the European Arrest Warrant. Following the hearing, a meeting of 149 MEPs from several parliamentary committees voted to confirm Mr McGrath’s appointment to the EU job, with 125 votes in favour, sources said. Mr McGrath stepped down as finance minister in June this year after being nominated by the Government to become Ireland’s next EU commissioner.",0,1
2024/11/5,"General election: When and how will it be called? Taoiseach Simon Harris is expected to set the wheels in motion for the next general election on Friday, with votes to be cast three weeks later, on Friday, November 29th “I don’t think that will come as a shock to any person right across this country,” he told reporters before heading into Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting. This is the last week of the present Dáil. A series of Bills will be rushed through the House on Tuesday and Wednesday and then the election will be called on Thursday or Friday. The slight complicating factor on the Taoiseach’s schedule is that he has to attend a meeting of European leaders in Budapest on Thursday afternoon and evening, running into Friday morning. So he either calls the election on Thursday morning before he goes, or Friday afternoon after he returns. Friday. Senior officials say that is what they are preparing for. The Taoiseach isn’t enthusiastic about calling an election and then being out of the country for the first 24 hours of the campaign, understandably. And he can’t skip the summit, which is likely to centre around a discussion on the EU’s response to the US election result. So the expectation is that he will return from Budapest as early as possible on Friday – probably early afternoon – and head to Aras an Uachtarain. The Taoiseach doesn’t actually dissolve the Dáil – the President does, on the advice of the Taoiseach. The President does have the power to refuse a dissolution but it has never been used and constitutional scholars say it could realistically only be used in the case where there was an obvious alternative government with the majority in the Dáil. That’s not the case. President Michael D Higgins will formally grant the dissolution, and the 33rd Dáil will be no more. There are, from that moment, no TDs, because there is no Dáil. A new Dáil will meet after the election, probably around December 18th. Yes. There is always a government. When the next Dáil votes in a new Taoiseach – or continues with the same one, and he or she forms a new government – the Ministers take over from the current Government. In the meantime, the Ministers of the current Government remain in office, though the convention is that they are a “caretaker” government, and do not make any significant policy decisions. That’s just a convention, though, not a rule, and sometimes circumstances dictate otherwise. In 2020, it was a “caretaker” government led by Leo Varadkar – after he had suffered a terrible election result – that introduced the first lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic. That will be set by the Minister for Housing and Local Government Darragh O’Brien. He must choose, essentially, whether it should be a three- or four-week campaign. Last week, speaking to reporters, he said that he would do whatever the party leaders had agreed. That is almost certain to be a three-week campaign, with votes to be cast on Friday, November 29th.",0,1
2024/11/5,"Election campaigning will not be curtailed by safety concerns, says Simon Harris Taoiseach confirms intention to to seek the dissolution of the Dáil this week Politicians campaigning in the general election race will not be curtailed as a result of concerns over personal safety, according to Taoiseach Simon Harris. His remarks about the safety of politicians come after an assault on Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman while he was canvassing at the weekend. During District Court proceedings on Monday Karl Ronan (45), with an address at Erris Square, Waterville, Blanchardstown, pleaded guilty to assaulting Mr O’Gorman. Speaking to reporters before Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting Mr Harris has said he has “completely condemned” what happened to Mr O’Gorman. He said: “In this country, we value the fact that our politicians can knock on your door, that they can come up to you in the supermarket. “My experience right across the country is people who vote for you and people who would never vote for you in a month of Sundays, they generally go about that engagement in a very decent way and I really hope that can be the way the campaign progresses in the days ahead.” He noted the assault on Mr O’Gorman is before the courts but said “more broadly” the Garda take such matters “very seriously” and will be monitoring the situation “closely throughout the campaign”. But the Fine Gael leader said: “We don’t want to see a situation in Ireland where campaigning becomes in any way curtailed and I don’t believe we will, by the way, as a result of this. “We need people to be able to move safely around the country – people of all political persuasions and none – and engage. That’s what’s great about our political democracy.” Separately, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said he has been out canvassing and  that people “are very courteous, people are engaging. “We should not allow the activities of generally a very small number of people in any way impact on the conduct of the campaign itself.” The Fianna Fáil leader also said the incident where Mr O’Gorman was assaulted is before the courts. “But more generally people are friendly, people are engaging, which is good and positive in terms of our democracy and I think that’s the prism through which I look at this.” Meanwhile, Mr Harris said he intends to seek the dissolution of the Dáil this week. He said there was “important business” that needed to be done first including the passing of the Finance Bill, which underpins the tax measures announced in the Budget and other legislation.  “Once that’s out of the way I do intend to seek a dissolution of the Dáil this week. I don’t think that will come as a shock to any person right across this country,” he said.  “That will provide a period of time in which we can have an election campaign and invite the people of Ireland to give their verdict on the next number of years”. He said there would be time over the Christmas period for parties to engage on how to form a government. “I’m really looking forward to the weeks ahead. This is a great country. It can be even better and we now have significant resources at our disposal,” he added. Mr Harris also noted he will attend meetings of European leaders in Hungary later this week. This trip will factor into when he decides to seek the dissolution of the Dáil. He said the meetings will be an “important discussion on a range of issues including the Middle East, the safety of our troops in Lebanon, and obviously the outcome of the US presidential election. “So we have to work through the choreography of all that.”",0,1
2024/11/5,"Michael McGrath never looked under pressure in EU job hearing Fianna Fáil politician was across the detail and won support for standing up to far-right MEPs in confirmation hearing Armed with no less than four binders of briefing notes, Michael McGrath never found himself in trouble during a 3½-hour hearing to confirm his appointment as EU commissioner for justice. Each of the 26 commissioners nominated to join Ursula von der Leyen around the table at the top of the European Commission must face confirmation hearings in the European Parliament. The former Fianna Fáil minister for finance had spent weeks studying the justice brief, bracing for a grilling by MEPs. His portfolio is a broad one, ranging from judicial co-operation, the European Arrest Warrant and data protection rules, to the rule of law, foreign interference in elections and consumer rights. The rule of law aspect of the job is particularly politically sensitive, as he will be the commission’s man cracking the whip on EU countries found to be undermining civil society, political opposition, judiciary or independent media. It will bring him into conflict with Viktor Orban’s populist government in Hungary, and potentially prime minister Robert Fico in Slovakia and Italian right-wing prime minister Giorgia Meloni. McGrath’s response to questions about the rule of law was watched closely, as MEPs tried to read whether he was up to the task. Since the European elections earlier this year. the balance of power has shifted rightward, with a fifth of MEPs now coming from far-right or populist right-wing parties. It was McGrath’s replies to several loaded questions from far-right MEPs during the hearing that earned him the most plaudits. He pushed back on criticism of the European Court of Justice and immigrants, drawing applause from the room. Privately, several MEPs who met him in the run-up to the hearing said they initially came away wondering if he had a firm grasp of his brief. But when it came to the crunch, he gave a solid performance and was across the details. Fielding questions from more than 40 MEPs, none put him under any visible pressure. MEPs  then took a vote behind closed doors on whether to approve his appointment. The Cork politician secured 125 of the 149 votes, easily clearing the two-thirds majority needed. As well as the three centrist political groups that make up the parliament’s majority, McGrath won the support of the Left group, the Greens and the hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists.",0,1
2024/11/6,"Minister for Enterprise warns of risk to Ireland’s economy in wake of Trump’s election Peter Burke says Government will work with new US administration and emphasise importance of trade and co-operation Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke has warned against economic protectionism in the wake of the US election result. Speaking in Dublin on Wednesday after Donald Trump was re-elected as US president, Mr Burke said the Government would work with the new US administration and emphasise the importance of trade and co-operation. “We all need to make that journey together, and if one country starts embarking on very significant economic protectionism, it leaves the globe at a significant disadvantage and makes all our journey harder and harder.” Mr Burke said that tariffs were “obviously the most significant thing”. He promised that Ireland would speak “truth to power” in its bilateral relations with the second Trump administration. He told reporters at Leinster House that it was difficult to predict exactly the path that the US would take on  corporation tax, but said he was not unduly concerned by the prospect of US companies immediately leaving Ireland in reaction to reforms or a lower 15 per cent tax rate, as Mr Trump promised in his campaign. He said  the “meat and bones” of the Trump administration’s approach to corporate tax would emerge in the coming period when his cabinet and advisers were appointed. Asked  whether Ireland would revert to a lower rate of corporation tax if developments presented a risk to the State, he said it was important to work multilaterally and through the agreed Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) framework on taxing multinationals. “It’s so important that we work together, because obviously we don’t want to go isolationist,” he said. US companies would not be able “pull the anchor and go immediately” due to their links into the Irish economy and its strengths, he added. Mr Burke said the Biden administration had imposed “very protectionist policies in some regard as well” under its Inflation Reduction Act, and that Europe had responded with State aid interventions. He said a subsidies race would not be to anyone’s benefit. The “last thing” Ireland wants to see is the introduction of new tariffs, emphasising the importance of rules-based fair trade. On Palestine, he said Ireland had to “robustly point out” where  US foreign policy does not comply with Irish values.",0,1
2024/11/6,"Jack Chambers warns of threat to future foreign investment from ‘more interventionist’ Trump policy  Minister for Finance raises concern about economic risks from new Republican administration’s plan to tax imports Future foreign direct investment from the US could be at risk from a “more interventionist” industrial policy likely under a Trump administration, Minister for Finance Jack Chambers has warned. In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Mr Chambers warned of the interventionist policy stance from the new Trump administration, with tariffs likely a “key policy instrument” which in turn would impact Irish exports and have “adverse implications” for the economy. With the incoming administration having signalled that taxes on imports will be part of their economic policy, Mr Chambers said tariffs now “appear to be a key policy instrument for the new administration”. This, he said, “would impact Irish exports and have adverse implications for our economy”. “A more interventionist industrial policy appears likely from the new administration and this might risk future waves of FDI which may not materialise,” he said. While he did not explicitly warn that corporation tax receipts would be hit, he repeated previous warnings of a “concentration risk” arising from the fact that a small number of US multinationals are responsible for a significant portion of this revenue, which he described as “volatile”. “That is why we must continue to run budgetary surpluses to protect the economic progress that has been achieved to date,” he said. Mr Chambers said that the US presidential election, making the election of Mr Trump to a second term following his 2017-2021 first administration would have “far-reaching consequences”. “Nowhere is this more true than in Ireland,” he said, citing historical, cultural and economic links with the US. “Put simply, the US is Ireland’s single-most important economic partner. Therefore, the economic policies pursued by the next US president will undoubtedly permeate through to the Irish economy.” He reiterated comments by Coalition leaders that the Government would work with the incoming administration. He said the relationship would continue to be mutually beneficial with Ireland continuing to stress the benefits of multilateralism and two-way international trade and investment. The Dublin West TD said the Government had been vindicated in establishing two long-term investment funds that will “establish fiscal buffers to protect Ireland’s economy in the future”. “Leaving aside the outcome of the US election, it is clear that the global economic landscape is changing – trade and investment are increasingly taking place on the basis of geopolitics,” he said.",0,1
2024/11/8,"Election housing debate should not be about ‘shouting numbers’, Simon Harris says Fine Gael leader promises more ‘interventionist’ State on child care and ‘firmer’ migration system The debate about housing policy in the general election should not come down to what party “can shout the biggest number” when promising how many houses they plan to build in government, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. Speaking hours before heformally asked for the Dáil to be dissolved, Mr Harris rejected the suggestion Fine Gael were at a disadvantage due to the large number of incumbent TDs who were not running again. Mr Harris said he hoped the campaign would not descend into “tit for tat” exchanges and rows that often dominate day-to-day political debate. “We don’t need the general election campaign to be like Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil,” he said. The election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States vindicated previous decisions by the Government to put money away into funds for the future, to guard against turbulence in the Irish economy, Mr Harris said. Europe needed to be prepared for the possible “transatlantic trade shock” of a second Trump presidency, he said. Mr Harris was speaking in Budapest, where he attended a dinner with other EU leaders on Thursday evening, before a further informal leaders summit on Friday morning. From there Mr Harris flew home to Dublin, where he travelled to Áras an Uachtaráin and formally asked President Michael D Higgins to dissolve the Dáil. Voting in the general election will take place on November 29th, following a three-week campaign. Speaking to reporters in Hungary, Mr Harris rattled through several core policies Fine Gael would touch on during the election. The State would need to take a “much more interventionist approach” in the childcare sector, to increase the number of places available to parents, he said. On immigration, the Taoiseach said while Ireland had benefited from inward migration, people wanted to know there were rules in place, as part of what he called “a much more efficient, fair and firm” system. Given housing is expected to be one of the dominating issues of the campaign, Mr Harris said the conversation should not be limited to “who can shout the biggest number about the number of houses they’re going to build”. There needed to be an interrogation of how parties credibly planned to hit housing targets they set in their manifestos, he said. “There hasn’t been an outright majority for any party in Ireland since the 1970s I think, and I don’t expect that to change in this election,” he said. While Fine Gael is leading opinion polls heading into the election, 18 of the party’s 35 TDs elected in 2020 are not standing again. Mr Harris said he did not “buy” the argument that incumbency was the “be all and end all” in Irish politics. The party was running many candidates who had experience outside of politics, he said. “So while some of the names might be new to you and to those of us who operate maybe in the Leinster House and political bubble, they’re not new in their communities,” he said. “When I travel around the country, people are looking for new blood, new energy, new ideas, to serve in Dáil Éireann. I will of course be making the case to the Irish people in the days and weeks ahead that Fine Gael offers that mix of experience and energy.”",0,1
2024/11/8,"Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to stand on their record in government Taoiseach Simon Harris says the three Coalition parties had governed well together and passed five progressive budgets  Speaking on the steps of Government Buildings on Friday afternoon, Mr Harris said the Coalition parties had made “great progress” since 2020 including five “progressive budgets”. They had also faced the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine and had sought to shelter people from the cost-of-living crisis. They did not agree on everything, but worked well together. He cited the Government’s recognition of the state of Palestine as a key achievement in office. The time was right to seek a new mandate, he suggested, though others will seek an alternative mandate. “I ask one thing: value your vote, use your voice. If you give me your trust, I will give you my all. It is the honour of my lifetime to serve as your Taoiseach,” he said. He delivered his brief remarks before going to Aras an Uáchtarain where President Michael D Higgins granted his request to dissolve the Dáil. Housing is likely to be the biggest issue of the election. Speaking in Budapest before returning to Ireland Mr Harris said parties should be judged not on the number of houses they say they are going to deliver, but on the credibility of their plans. The conversation should not be limited to “who can shout the biggest number about the number of houses they’re going to build”. Fianna Fáil too looks like it will campaign on its record in government over the last five years. Micheál Martin told reporters the Government had “demonstrated the capacity to lead the country through very difficult times” with Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and hyperinflation. Progress had been made in three areas where Fianna Fáil held the Cabinet portfolios of housing, health and education. “We have been an agent of change in housing policy, likewise in health we have engineered change and we want to do more,” he said. “The radical developments in women’s health by Stephen Donnelly has been a game-changer over the last number of years. We want safer cities and we are going to maintain our historic vision in respect of education. “Who would have thought five years ago we would have free books from primary school to Leaving Certificate?” Mr Martin insisted that his party would not go into government after the election with Sinn Féin. “It is clear they don’t get our economic model. They don’t get the enterprise model, they don’t believe in free trade. They failed to support the application of the Canadian-EU trade deal which is indicative of their attitude to the economy which is one of disconnect. “The dynamic of the campaign will take over. I would be wary of predictions, campaigns take on a dynamic all of their own. Fianna Fáil is focused on maximising its votes, maximising the number of seats. I’m not concentrating on others.” Mr Martin cut short the press conference then and went on a walkabout. He was accompanied by party candidates in Dublin, Catherine Ardagh, Jim O’Callaghan and Mary Fitzpatrick.",0,1
2024/11/8,"Death announced of former senator Billy Lawless who built successful pub business in Chicago  Galway native was nominated to the Seanad in 2016 by then taoiseach Enda Kenny Former senator Billy Lawless, originally from Galway but who became a successful publican after moving to Chicago in the 1990s, has died aged 73. Lawless was known as a champion of the undocumented Irish in the United States, and was made a Freeman of Galway in 2015 in recognition of his work for Irish emigrants. Then Taoiseach Enda Kenny nominated him to the Seanad in 2016 where he served one term. Married to Anne Lawless, he had four children. He was a Fine Gael activist in Galway before his move to the United States. Lawless moved to Chicago in 1998 after his daughter won a rowing scholarship to Boston University. Lawless was a noted oarsman as a young man and was very involved with rowing in Galway City. After moving to Chicago, he opened a chain of pubs and restaurants. President Michael D Higgins lead tributes to Lawless, who was a neighbour in Galway.  He said the former senator was a “stalwart” of the Irish community in Chicago. “Billy’s role in fostering the sister city relationship between Galway and Chicago was rightly recognised by Galway City Council in his being made a Freeman of Galway in 2015,” he said. “Sabina and I recall also the generous and warm welcome that Billy extended to us when we visited Chicago in 2014. In 2021 he was among those to whom I presented a Presidential Distinguished Service Award for Irish Community Support, which was so richly deserved.” Taoiseach Simon Harris also paid tribute to the former senator. “Billy Lawless was a gentleman to his core, he was a businessman at the top of his game, and he was a person who accepted a challenge from former Taoiseach Enda Kenny – to travel from Chicago to Leinster House to represent the Irish diaspora. “He did his work with diligence and great pride; he was great company, and he was an extremely kind man. To his family and large circle of friends and colleagues, I am truly sorry for your loss,” the Taoiseach said. His close friends in the Seanad Independent Group, Michael McDowell and Victor Boyhan, said: “It is with great sadness that we learned earlier today of the death of our dear friend former Senator Billy Lawless. “Billy was a member of our Seanad Independent Group from 2016 to 2020 where he served with distinction as part of our ten-strong group of Independent members in Seanad Éireann. “Billy was a tireless advocate for the diaspora and the undocumented Irish in the United States. He was a political force who made a difference in Irish and American politics over many decades, but above all, a husband, father and grandfather who will be dearly missed in Chicago, Galway and further afield. “Former Senator Lawless greatly helped the cause of Irish immigrants and was made Freeman of Galway for these efforts. He was also conferred with an Honorary Doctorate by University of Galway.”",0,1
2024/11/9,"Bulging veins, tossed leaflets and ‘complete violence’: politicians canvassing for general election take precautions amid safety fears ‘You just don’t know who’s going to open that door to you’: canvassers are wary of growing hostility when they knock at houses The general election campaign has, even informally prior to Friday’s official start, only been in its early stages but former broadcaster Alison Comyn, a first-time candidate for Fianna Fáil hoping to become a TD in Louth, has experienced five “bad encounters” while out canvassing. “When a man is screaming in your face with veins popping on his neck and using very strong expletives, your heart is thumping in your chest,” she says of one of those encounters. “You just think I haven’t even had a chance to speak yet.” The vast majority of her interactions with the voting public have been positive, and people are welcoming, says Comyn, but on a handful of occasions that has certainly not been the case. “I had a man run down the street, roll up one of my canvass cards and throw it in my face and saying: ‘My door says no junk mail,’” she says. Another time one of her canvassers was “manhandled” by a resident whose door they knocked on. Comyn and the canvasser left immediately. The incident was “quite mild but at the same time very frightening because you don’t know where these things are going to go”, she says. Comyn says she would not hesitate to report something serious but she has reservations. “I don’t want to have to call the guards – it would be not exactly how I’d like my canvass to go – so you just metaphorically take it on the chin, hopefully not physically.” Of the angry reaction of a small minority, she says: “You’re putting your head above the parapet” to try to help. “If somebody doesn’t agree with the party, honestly it doesn’t take much to just say: ‘Not for me’, and close the door nicely.” The issue of the abuse politicians face has come to the fore again in recent days. Green Party leader and Minister for Children and Integration Roderic O’Gorman was assaulted while canvassing in his Dublin West constituency last weekend. A 45-year-old man has pleaded guilty to assaulting O’Gorman and is before the courts. O’Gorman has since said he is worried about the safety of canvassers and politicians on the campaign trail. “One of the most important things” about the Irish political system is talking to people and asking for votes “one on one”, he says. O’Gorman says the Garda would be working with political parties and others “to ensure there is safety so that we can have a vigorous debate”. Garda liaison inspectors were appointed in each division nationwide since before the local and European elections in June and these are still in place “to help keep all those participating in the forthcoming elections safe”, the Garda said in a statement. The Garda advised any candidate who experiences harassment or may be the victim of any crime to report it to them. On Friday the Garda and Coimisiún na Meán, the State’s media regulator, published advice for candidates on online safety, including how to react to scenarios such as threats after a canvass, “deepfake” images and racist messages. An updated version of a booklet on safety guidance for candidates produced by the Garda in conjunction with the Women for Election and See Her Elected organisation was published this week. It advises candidates to avoid, where possible, canvassing alone or in the dark and not to leave people behind on doors among a series of precautions they should take. One politician who will not be canvassing after dark is another Dublin West candidate, councillor Tania Doyle, an Independent on Fingal County Council. She and her husband, Derek, were just finished putting up local election posters in the early hours of Wednesday morning last May when they were violently attacked by two men. One of the men demanded her views on immigration and started to video her. When her husband asked the man to put the phone away, an attack began that Doyle said at the time included “punches and kicks and complete violence”. She feared for both of their lives and said it was when the other man eventually tried to restrain the attacker, they were able to flee. A Garda investigation into the incident is ongoing. It was one of the worst of a number of serious incidents around the country during the local election. Doyle persevered with her campaign, going on to top the poll and retaining her council seat. Six months later she is hoping to be elected as a TD, though she acknowledges she is apprehensive given what happened. “Of course I am,” she says. “I’d be telling you a lie if I said everything is 100 per cent. I don’t feel 100 per cent. But I have that strength in me to keep going and do what I feel is right to do.” Campaigning on a platform of improving services in the rapidly growing Dublin 15 area in the west of the city, she says she is confident canvassing during the day and feels “completely safe in my area”. Her team travels in groups, “buddy up” and do not leave anyone behind. But she has decided not to canvass when it gets dark and that is a “direct result” of her experience in May. “I just feel when it’s dark you just don’t know who’s going to open that door to you,” she says. Dublin Mid-West Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin trains canvassers in his own constituency on how to disengage from confrontations with the potential to escalate. “You thank them for their time and you get out of there as quickly as possible,” Ó Broin advises of such encounters. He noticed during the local election that a small number of people wanted to have a “very loud, angry exchange” whereas in previous elections it might have been a “frosty reception but you wouldn’t have got anything aggressive”. Though angry confrontations are rare, they can be frightening for inexperienced canvassers, he says. He himself had “two really problematic engagements” during the campaign leading up to the June elections. One was when he was videoed while waiting for a bus by a “far right anti-migrant protester” who was “right in my face screaming at me and I just had to hold my composure”. The man called him a “rat” and a “traitor” and said he was going to be run out of Clondalkin. “My response to him, very politely and calmly, was the electorate will get to decide that,” says Ó Broin. The other incident was in an estate where a resident tore up a canvasser’s leaflet and threw it at him. As the canvasser left, the man “proceeded to walk out after us and was incredibly belligerent”. “Again if you were inexperienced, if you didn’t know how to handle that, that stuff would be clearly very intimidating,” he says. Ó Broin has not had similar experiences so far in this campaign. He says the “real challenge” is that anybody looking at such incidents “will have second thoughts about wanting to get involved in politics”. “And particularly if you’re a woman, particularly if you are a person of colour, particularly if you’re a from the lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans community, that stuff has a real chilling factor.” It is not a new phenomenon but “what has changed is there’s now a group of people and they don’t want to have an engagement with you about an issue,” he says. “They want a loud verbal confrontation with you and in many instances they want that for social media for whatever purpose.” “That can be very intimidating for folks.”",0,1
2024/11/9,"Pro-Palestine supporters and young voters urged to ‘choose wisely’ in election, march hears Solidarity campaign chair tells protestors to ensure every politician knows territory is ‘key’ issue in lead up to polling day Pro-Palestinian protesters and young voters have been urged to register to vote and “choose wisely” in the coming general election at a march in Dublin city on Saturday afternoon. Calls were made for Palestine to be made a major general election issue as large crowds descended upon O’Connell Street chanting “sanctions now” and labelling Israel as a “terrorist state”. More than 43,000 Palestinians are estimated by Gaza’s health ministry to have been killed in the war since October 7th, while a United Nations report issued on Friday shows that nearly 70 per cent of the 8,000 fatalities verified by the UN Human Rights Office were women and children. After arriving at Leinster House, protesters chanted “Simon Harris, shame on you, Micheál Martin, shame on you” and “Irish Government, shame on you”. They were urged by speakers to ensure they are registered to vote and to “choose wisely” when voting. Zoe Lawlor, chair of the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, told those gathered that the next government “must reflect the will of the people”. “We are sick of endless words of concern and condemnation, it is meaningless unless it is turned into action,” she said, adding: “We will not let promises be dangled to us before an election only to be shelved again.” Ms Lawlor said the outgoing Government should have enacted the Occupied Territories Bill (OTB), aimed at banning trade between Ireland and Israel’s illegal settlements in Occupied Palestinian Territories, describing it as the “bare minimum” to uphold international law. She told those present to let every politician know that Palestine is a “key” issue for them in the lead-up to the general election, while People Before Profit’s Richard Boyd-Barrett said the outgoing Government is “afraid of this movement on the streets”. After outlining crises in housing, healthcare, and the cost of living, Mr Boyd-Barrett said: “Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s people will vote, the young people, the people who believe in common decency, have to get out and vote and make your voice heard in this election.” Speaking at the Garden of Remembrance before the march, Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik said Palestine is a “huge issue” for voters who are in “deep distress” at the doors. “Everyone wants to see more meaningful action from Government, it’s deeply disappointing and frustrating that the outgoing Government did not do more to pass the OTB into law,” she said. Ms Bacik, who said her party has aspirations to form part of the next government, added that enacting the bill is a “must” for the party, in advance of any coalition talks. “We absolutely want to be in government to ensure that we can deliver for our communities,” she said, adding that she will seek to develop a “common platform” across centre-left parties such as the Green Party and the Social Democrats. “My concern is that the next Government will be any two of the three biggest parties propped up by a handful of right-wing independents who will not have the commitment to deliver on state investment and meaningful climate action that we on the left have,” she said. Agreeing that Palestine will be a major issue for voters, People Before Profit’s Paul Murphy, meanwhile, said there is a narrative that Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil will return to power. “The election is just starting, the outcome is not predetermined,” he said, adding that a change in government “is possible”. “The best way for that to happen is for Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats to join with us in ruling out a coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and therefore giving people a clear choice,” he said.",0,1
2024/12/10,"FF TD Robert Troy breached Ethics Act by failing to disclose properties but ‘acted in good faith’, report finds Standards in Public Office Commission publishes report on investigation into Fianna Fáil TD Robert Troy An investigation by the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) has found that Fianna Fáil TD Robert Troy contravened part of the Ethics Act by his failure to declare fully some properties he owned and other interests but concluded that he “acted in good faith”. Mr Troy resigned as a minister of State in August 2022 after issues with his declarations of interest emerged, saying he made “human errors” which were “not intentional”. He submitted amended declarations of interests the same month correcting the omissions. Mr Troy was re-elected as a TD for Longford-Westmeath last month. Sipo investigated Mr Troy’s declarations to the Dáil register of interests for the years 2020 and 2021. The watchdog has found that Mr Troy contravened the Ethics Act in relation to the declaration of a number of properties, a contract and a directorship in these years. The commission found that he contravened section 5 of the Ethics Act “on multiple occasions, in some respects inadvertently and in some respects negligently”. Its report adds: “While an individual error, once corrected promptly, may not in itself be a serious matter, the commission finds that this pattern of omissions or errors in successive declarations was a serious matter.” However, Sipo also found that Mr Troy “did not intentionally seek to conceal, or avoid public disclosure of, his interests” and “accordingly, the commission is of the view that Deputy Troy acted in good faith”. Mr Troy welcomed the Sipo findings. He said: “I have always accepted this was a serious matter and sought to rectify my errors as soon as they became apparent.” He also said: “The commission did not find evidence that I acted other than in the mistaken belief that my actions in making the original declarations were in accordance with the commission’s guidelines. I am glad the process has now been concluded.” Reports that Mr Troy had not correctly declared his property interests first appeared in the online news outlet the Ditch.",0,1
2024/12/11,"From celebration to shambles: The rise and fall of a new TD in less than six hours Social Democrats’ support for Palestinians and call for sanctions on Israel undermined by Eoin Hayes’s shareholding in company involved with Israel Defense Forces  An unprecedented political controversy has seen a party marking its expanded number of TDs go from a celebration to a shambles in less than six hours and suspending one of those deputies before the Dáil had sat for the first time since the general election. Eoin Hayes (37) pipped Sinn Féin incumbent Chris Andrews to the final seat in Dublin Bay South in last month’s general election, less than six months after being elected to Dublin City Council for the Social Democrats in the Kimmage-Rathmines ward. Born in Limerick, he lived in Pennsylvania in the US until he was 14. He returned to Ireland and completed a degree in chemical engineering at UCC, and a masters in management at London Business School, before heading back to America to work. He returned to Ireland in 2018 and started a consultancy firm, Cantillon Labs, advising small businesses and start-ups, mainly software and technology companies, on their finances. However, a story in the Irish Daily Mail last week about his past employment, and shareholding in a software company, sparked controversy. Between 2015 and 2017, when based in New York, Hayes worked for Palantir Technologies, a data firm cofounded by billionaire Peter Thiel with investment from the CIA. The company built programmes to mine data including social media posts, phone and internet records, providing companies and governments with controversial surveillance technology. Its offering expanded to supplying AI technology to businesses and armies including the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). This software, used in Gaza,  has the capacity to identify specific targets for drone attacks and air strikes. As part of his salary package, Hayes received shares in the company. After he was elected to the council in June, Hayes made a declaration of assets, which said he had divested from all holdings “within the last 12 months”. The form was dated June 26th, before he sold his shares. The party said it was an “unfortunate typo” as he had not submitted the form until July 24th after he sold the shares. During a shambolic press conference on Tuesday, Hayes, under persistent questioning, repeatedly said he had sold the shares before he entered politics, but declined to say exactly when and for how much. He said “as soon as I became aware that Israel had very close relationships with that company I divested”. However, after the press conference, he issued a statement in which he admitted this was “not true” and apologising unreservedly. He said he worked in “areas like HR and IT” for Palantir and “had absolutely no role in anything related to any military contracts, for the Israeli military or anyone else”. “As part of my salary package, I was provided with shares. The conditions attaching to those shares meant I was unable to sell them until 2021, six months after the company had gone public. “Throughout the course of the past year, Palantir’s support for the Israeli military has markedly increased. In January, the company signed a new strategic partnership with the Israeli Defence Ministry. I should have sold my shares then and I deeply regret that I did not. “I had 7,000 shares in the company, all of which dated from my employment nearly a decade ago, and sold them in July 2024 for a pretax figure of €199,000.” After Tuesday’s press conference, Hayes issued the statement clarifying what had actually happened. Social Democrats deputy leader Cian O’Callaghan then issued his own statement, saying: “Eoin provided incorrect information to the media when he stated he had sold his shares before he entered politics . . . This is a serious matter which the party is now reviewing.” An hour later, in another statement, O’Callaghan, who had defended Hayes at the press conference, said Hayes’s initial explanation about selling the shares before entering politics “was not true”. “This is a serious matter. It is imperative that the media, who hold politicians to account on behalf of the public, can rely on the information they receive from elected representatives,” he said. “For that reason, Eoin Hayes has been suspended from the Social Democrats parliamentary party with immediate effect.” Hayes remains a TD and will sit as an Independent when the Dáil returns next week. In a third statement, issued late on Tuesday evening, he said he hoped “to earn back the trust of the Social Democrats and will work hard to do so”. The party has given no indication of how long the suspension will last, but the unprecedented incident has seriously damaged the party’s reputation. When Hayes went through the party candidate selection and development process, he said he was upfront about his shareholdings. The party will have strengthen its selection processes and ask more detailed questions about such matters in future.",0,1
2024/12/11,"Soc Dems have ‘taken a knock’ in Hayes controversy, admits deputy leader Cian O’Callaghan could not say if suspended TD has a route back into the party in the future The Social Democrats have “taken a knock and deservedly so” by the controversy surrounding Eoin Hayes, according to the party’s deputy leader Cian O’Callaghan, who could not say if the suspended TD has a route back into the party in the future. Mr Hayes was suspended by the party on Tuesday after he admitted he divested shares in Palantir Technologies, a company which supplied military technology to Israel in July this year, a month after being elected to be a member of Dublin City Council. The Dublin Bay South TD had previously said he had sold the shares before becoming a public representative. At a press conference on Wednesday evening Mr O’Callaghan said his party had unanimously agreed to suspend Mr Hayes’ membership of the parliamentary party. “At all times” information given to the media, the public “and to ourselves should be accurate”, he said, adding “that’s why that decision was taken”. Mr O’Callaghan said that his party only learned the exact the dates that Mr Hayes had divested the shares on Tuesday after journalists had been quizzing him on the matter. “It was at that point it was clear that the information he had given to us was not correct,” Mr O’Callaghan said. Attempts to contact Mr Hayes for comment were unsuccessful. Mr O’Callaghan said the party was due to hold a meeting of its national executive on Wednesday night “so we can review all of the issues related to and leading up to our decision yesterday”. Asked by reporters if there was any route back into the party for the Dublin Bay South TD, Mr O’Callaghan replied: “We’re not at the point now in terms of knowing what will happen in the future.” He said the party has “made mistakes” and is committed to learning from them, and it has “taken a knock and deservedly so”. Mr O’Callaghan also said the Social Democrats got a “very strong mandate” in the election, and people wanted it to act on issues like housing, healthcare, childcare, disability services and climate action “so that’s what we’re focused on, and that’s what we continue to be focused on”. Earlier, the party’s Dublin Central TD Gary Gannon apologised for a claim he made in a podcast that some journalists who asked questions about Mr Hayes’s shares were only doing so because they were interested in getting jobs as government special advisers. “There are a couple of journalists who recognise there are special adviser jobs coming up. In other jobs you put out CVs. For these jobs you put front pages out,” he said on the podcast, which was recorded before Mr Hayes’ admission. On Wednesday Mr Gannon said he wished to retract what he had said. “It was a poor comment for me to make, and I apologise to journalists for having said it.”",0,1
2024/12/11,"‘Completely unworkable’: Plans for Sipo to enforce lobbyists’ cooling-off periods criticised Sipo said offences would be better dealt with through the courts, but the Department rejected this approach, saying it could have a ‘chilling effect’ In correspondence with the Department of Public Expenditure, Sipo said plans to leave enforcement up to them instead of the courts were “completely unworkable.” They warned that there was a “high litigation risk” and that offences related to cooling-off periods would be better dealt with through the court system. The Department of Public Expenditure rejected this approach, saying that dealing with it as a criminal matter could have a “chilling effect.” Records show how Sipo told the Government that plans for amended legislation on the regulation of lobbying were fraught with difficulty. They said they were already struggling with a lack of resources and adding to their work would “heighten the risk of under-resourcing, and of error, in relation to [their] portfolio as a whole.” Sipo also argued there was little reason to keep the process outside of the legal system as each case was likely to be appealed anyway. An email from the Sipo director general Elaine Cassidy in March 2022 said: “Given the financial and reputational impact on the individual, one might anticipate an appeal to the Circuit Court on almost every occasion. “This would result in the commission engaging in a legal procedure, with processes and safeguards aimed at ensuring procedural fairness in order to be defensible, only to defend a full re-hearing of the same issue before the Circuit Court.” Ms Cassidy said that while she hoped Sipo would be able to defend any appeal, some losses were “almost inevitable.” “[This] would have both a reputational and financial impact on the commission,” she wrote. The records show the Department of Public Expenditure was worried a scenario could arise where a person ended up in prison for taking a lobbying job without following the rules correctly. It was also concerned about former politicians and public sector staff being put through the “stressful process of criminal proceedings” for a breach of lobbying rules. However, Sipo argued that their hearings were “no less stressful, costly or damaging for an individual than the criminal process.” Ms Cassidy wrote: “Investigation hearings are adversarial, held in public and well covered in the media.” In a later email from March 2022, Sipo continued to raise what they said were their “significant concerns” over being left in charge of the investigation process. By April, they warned they would have to contact then Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath directly saying the new legislation on “administrative sanctions” around lobbying was “completely unworkable.” A further note of their concerns warned of having to run multiple investigations simultaneously without enough staff. An email said: “[It] would give rise to both resource challenges and litigation risk for the Commissioner.” In May 2022, Sipo sent a letter to Mr McGrath saying the four commissioners in the standards body already had “other demanding public service positions.” “The commission’s view is that it is more appropriate to maintain a single system of criminal sanctions for all of the contraventions of the Act, with fixed payment notices available in appropriate cases,” said Sipo’s chairman, Mr Justice Garrett Sheehan. In response, Mr McGrath said it was important the rules around ‘cooling off’ and employment as a lobbyist did not have a “chilling effect.” He wrote: “I am confident that this approach is a proportionate policy response; it balances the constitutional right of an individual to earn a living with the need to limit potential conflicts of interest that could undermine public trust.” Asked about the records, which were released following an FOI appeal to the Information Commissioner, Sipo said it had nothing further to add.",0,1
2024/12/11,"Ireland to intervene in two genocide cases at International Court of Justice under new proposals State would submit Declarations of Intervention against Israel and Myanmar as part of plans being put forward by Tánaiste Ireland would intervene in two genocide cases at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) under proposals to be considered by Cabinet on Wednesday. The first case is the one initiated by South Africa last December against Israel over alleged breaches of the 1948 Genocide Convention during the war in Gaza. To date, more than 44,000 people are reported to have been killed in Gaza during the war sparked by the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023. The second case is  one taken by The Gambia in 2019 accusing Myanmar of genocide over operations by its armed forces conducted against the ethnic minority Rohingya people. More than 10,000 Rohingya people are reported to have been killed and approximately 700,000 have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin will seek Cabinet approval for Ireland to intervene in the two cases when ministers meet on Wednesday. By filing a declaration of intervention in a case, which must be accepted by the court, a state like Ireland does not join the case on behalf of one side or the other. Rather, an intervening state may assist the court by making submissions on interpretation of provisions of the Genocide Convention. The Irish Times understands that Mr Martin proposes to intervene to promote a consistent interpretation of the Genocide Convention which prioritises the protection of civilian life, and to demonstrate Ireland’s strong commitment to the rule of law and international justice. It is proposed to file both Declarations of Intervention in the coming weeks, in consultation with the Attorney General. In its case against Israel, South Africa asked the ICJ to order provisional measures to apply pending its final judgment. In three separate orders, the court ordered Israel to take steps to ensure its military does not commit genocidal acts, to limit the scope of its military operations in Gaza and to facilitate humanitarian aid. However, in November, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed serious concern that Israel is failing in these obligations. Since South Africa initiated its case against Israel, Nicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Palestine, Spain, Turkey, Chile, the Maldives and Bolivia have all filed Declarations of Intervention. There have been two interventions in The Gambia’s case against Myanmar – one by the Maldives and a joint Intervention by Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. Separately, Mr Martin is to seek Cabinet approval for Ireland to participate as a guest country in South Africa’s G20 presidency between December 2024 and November 2025. It is the first time Ireland has been invited to join the group, which represents the world’s 20 largest economies. Ministers are expected to be told that participation would provide an opportunity to influence approaches on issues of global strategic importance like economic growth, sustainable development, food security and climate change. There will be a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in February and a summit involving heads of State and government next November. Others invited to participate as guest countries include Nigeria, Egypt, Norway, Netherlands, Spain, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. Ministers are also due to consider a new Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) between Ireland and the World Food Programme, lasting from 2025 to 2027, involving €105 million in funding. The proposal is being brought by Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue and the sum involved is a 40 per cent increase in the €75 million provided under the previous agreement covering 2022 to 2024. The new SPA will prioritise assistance to key areas, such as the Horn of Africa, Syria, and climate-related hunger interventions.",0,1
2024/12/11,"Subsidiary of main National Children’s Hospital contractor to secure major State building project Analysis by State determines benefits of awarding the project to a BAM subsidiary ‘clearly outweigh’ costs of Technological University buildings The Government is poised to award a major construction contract to a company jointly controlled by BAM, the main contractor for the National Children’s Hospital, despite not meeting value-for-money tests. Ministers will on Wednesday consider a proposal to proceed with the tender for Invesis, formerly known as BAM PPP, a vehicle for building public-private partnerships (PPPs) controlled by the Dutch construction giant along with a pension fund. The project will see new buildings constructed at the Atlantic Technological University in Galway and Letterkenny, the South-East Technological University at Carlow and Waterford, and the Technological University of the Shannon. A final cost/benefit analysis conducted by the State found that economic benefits “clearly outweigh” the economic costs, but Ministers will also be told that the tender price exceeded the upper end of a public sector benchmark used in a value-for-money comparison test. Prof Eoin Reeves of the University of Limerick’s department of economics, who has researched PPPs, said that guidelines governing these deals require a project to pass the value-for-money test. “This is to ensure that the PPP costs less than using traditional procurement. The public sector benchmark is an estimate of the project cost using traditional procurement,” he said. If the cost of using a public-private partnership exceeds the benchmark, “one would not expect the project to proceed as a PPP”, he said. Guidelines for PPPs allow State bodies to award contracts to bids if they comply with the public sector benchmark – but if they exceed this, they must be approved by the Government. It is understood that the Government’s view is that the building projects will help economic growth at a regional level, and that the State will get approximately €1.60 back for every €1 it spends on the project. The tender received approval at Cabinet in July, but Minister for Higher Education Patrick O’Donovan sought a further cost/benefit analysis before proceeding It is understood that the State’s analysis is that works planned under the contract would be delayed if it did not proceed or if it moved to retender for the project. The Department of Public Expenditure is understood to be supportive of awarding the tender. The guidelines outline that the final decision on a project should not be based on the value-for-money test alone. A spokesman for BAM declined to comment. The State has been criticised for years for its spending and time overruns on the National Children’s Hospital, where BAM is the main contractor. It has also become embroiled in a series of legal disputes with BAM, which most recently lodged proceedings in the High Court against the board overseeing development of the hospital after a dispute over millions of euro in additional fees. A bitter war of words broke out between Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly and the company before the general election, which also saw the Opposition target the Government over the cost of the €2.2 billion hospital.",0,1
2024/12/11,"Social Democrats’ Gary Gannon apologises for ‘poor comment’ on journalists examining Eoin Hayes’s shares  Gannon had claimed some journalists were only asking questions because they were interested in government special adviser jobs Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon has apologised for a claim that some journalists who asked questions about Eoin Hayes’s shares in a company that provided military technology for Israel were only doing so because they were interested in government special adviser jobs. Mr Gannon said what he had said was “poor comment” on his part. He made the remarks on the Echo Chamber podcast. It was recorded before Mr Hayes admitted he divested shares, worth €200,000, in Palantir Technologies only after becoming a public representative and not before as he had previously claimed. On foot of that new information coming to light on Tuesday afternoon, the Social Democrats leadership suspended Mr Hayes from the party. In the podcast, recorded before Mr Hayes’s admission, Mr Gannon criticised journalists for bringing the question up with the newly-elected Dublin Bay South TD. “There are a couple of journalists who recognise there are special adviser jobs coming up. In other jobs you put out CVs. For these jobs you put front pages out,” he said. He added a little later: “There are special adviser jobs coming up and this is how you flash your eyelids at them.” On Wednesday, Mr Gannon said he wished to retract what he had said. “It was a poor comment for me to make and I apologise to journalists for having said it. “Coming out of the last week I was exhausted. I had not been aware [of the date of divestment] at that stage. On reflection it was a poor comment,” he said. Palantir is a big data company founded by billionaire Peter Thiel that, among other things, had a “strategic partnership for battle tech” with Israel. Mr Hayes admitted on Tuesday that he divested his shares in the company in July this year, a month after being elected to be a member of Dublin City Council. He had previously said he had sold the shares before becoming a public representative. On foot of his admission, the Social Democrats suspended Mr Hayes. Several party sources have said he is unlikely to be allowed to rejoin the party because of the serious nature of the manner in which he had misled his colleagues. In a message sent to supporters on Tuesday night, Mr Hayes said he had “misspoken” when explaining the divestiture of his shares. Also speaking on Wednesday, Paul Murphy of People Before Profit said Mr Hayes should resign his Dáil seat because of the way he had misrepresented his candidature. He also said that he should give the proceeds of the divestment to Palestinian charities. “We have our differences with Sinn Féin,” said Mr Murphy. “But the person who has lost out [in Dublin Bay South] is Chris Andrews. People thought there was equality on both sides in relation to the Palestinian issue. That was not the case.” Mr Andrews was eliminated on the 12th count, when Mr Hayes was elected to the final seat in the four seat constituency.",0,1
2024/12/14,"United Nations urged to release report into death in Lebanon of Pte Seán Rooney  Organisation criticised repeatedly for failure to hand over crucial documents to coroner investigating soldier’s death Tánaiste Micheál Martin has called on the United Nations to release its report into the death of Pte Seán Rooney to his family. Pte Rooney died two years ago today when his convoy was ambushed near the town of Al-Aqbiya in the south of Lebanon, a Hizbullah stronghold. The 24-year-old from Newtowncunningham, Co Donegal, was killed on December 14th, 2022, while driving an armoured jeep as part of Defence Forces Unifil peacekeeping duties. The UN Board of Inquiry report on Pte Rooney’s death, which was concluded in April 2023, was shared with the Irish Government under strict criteria, including the UN’s insistence that it may not be shared with third parties or made public in any form, either in whole or in part, and the final report will not be published. A request for the report was also made by Dublin coroner Myra Cullinane. She said in October that a request in August for information from the UN did not elicit a response. She is investigating the death. “The Government and I will continue to press the UN via diplomatic channels regarding the release of the UN reports to the family. Since the events of December 2022, I have consistently expressed both my and the Government’s determination that all of the facts and circumstances of the incident are fully established. No stone should be left unturned to ensure those responsible are brought to justice,” said Mr Martin. “I know that the uncertainty surrounding the progress of the various investigations into the incident is very difficult and compounds the grief of Seán’s family ... At every opportunity, I have stressed my unhappiness with the slow progress of the trial of those accused of Seán’s murder and I have made that very clear to both Lebanese authorities and to the UN.” He also urged the UN to co-operate with Dr Cullinane’s inquest into Pte Rooney’s death. A spokesperson for UN secretary general António Guterres told RTÉ News that it will share more information with the family of Pte Rooney about the circumstances of his death, but it did not specify what data it would share. Pte Rooney’s family solicitor, Darragh Mackin, said they did not have an “iota of information” on what details are contained in the UN investigation. “I would be disappointed if the full report is not released to the family,” said Mr Mackin on RTÉ. “The UN is no different than any other public body or international body. Their obligation is to provide all the information to the coroner. They can raise legitimate concerns, for example, national security or methodology. All relevant material should be provided to the coroner.”",0,1
2024/12/16,"Occupied Territories Bill raised by US business lobby group in talks with Minister  US Chamber of Commerce discussed planned legislation with Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke as speculation grows Ireland’s stance on Israel’s war in Gaza may trigger economic repercussions The Washington DC-based lobby group, which bills itself as the world’s largest business organisation, was in Dublin for talks along with several US companies with Mr Burke, and also met Minister for Finance Jack Chambers and senior officials in the Department of Health. During their talks with Mr Burke, the Department of Enterprise confirmed that it raised the legislation, which the outgoing government has indicated it will progress if returned to office. A spokeswoman for the department said the discussion during the meeting covered a range of topics. “The US Chamber of Commerce raised the Occupied Territories Bill, and Minister Burke and his officials noted same.” There has been speculation that Ireland’s stance on the Gaza war may prompt potential economic headwinds for the State, with many US multinationals invested here supportive of Israel. The legislation, which was introduced by Independent Senator Frances Black in 2018, had lain dormant for years despite passing various stages in the Oireachtas, after previous attorneys general advised that the Bill was contrary to European Union trade law. Following an advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice, the outgoing coalition sought fresh legal advice on the stalled Bill as the opinion created a “new context” for it, after the UN court found Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in breach of international law in a non-binding advisory opinion. It also found that Israel’s occupation of these territories amounts to long-term annexation and has undermined the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. Israel’s ambassador to Ireland, Dana Erlich, said on Monday that if the legislation was enacted, no US companies would be able to operate in Ireland. She was speaking after the Israeli government said it would shut its embassy in Dublin. Ms Erlich told RTÉ news that Ireland was an “extreme voice” in the international arena, saying no other country had matched Ireland’s stance over the Israeli assault on Gaza. Earlier on Monday, both Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin defended Ireland. Mr Harris accused Israel of using it as a ploy to distract attention from the thousands of children killed by its armed forces. “I think we should be very careful in not falling for what I believe are distractions by the Israeli government. It is deeply regrettable that it decided to shut its embassy. I don’t in any way minimise that decision, but it’s nothing in comparison to what’s happening in the Middle East, absolutely nothing,” he said. In Brussels, Mr Martin denied the Government had been acting in a “hostile” way to Israel in seeking to hold it to account for its actions in its war in Gaza. The Fianna Fáil leader said Ireland’s intervention at the International Court of Justice and its previous recognition of the state of Palestine had been motivated by “respect for international humanitarian law”.",0,1
2024/12/16,"Israeli foreign minister calls Taoiseach Simon Harris ‘antisemitic’ Taoiseach said he would not comment on ‘personalised and false attacks and remains focused on the horrific war crimes being perpetrated in Gaza’ Israel’s foreign minister accused Taoiseach Simon Harris on Monday of antisemitism as he defended Israel’s decision to close its embassy in Dublin over Ireland’s policies. “There is a difference between criticism - and antisemitism based on the delegitimisation and dehumanisation of Israel and double standards towards Israel,” Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said in a statement. He cited Ireland’s support for what he called “politicised” proceedings against Israeli leaders by the International Criminal Court as well as Irish support for an action at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide over its campaign in Gaza. “Last night Ireland’s antisemitic Prime Minister Simon Harris said in an interview ‘Ireland is not anti-Israel but Ireland is absolutely anti the starvation of children’,” Mr Saar said. “Is Israel starving children?” He said Israel was working to enable humanitarian aid to reach Gaza and prevent civilian casualties while he said Hamas was looting aid and using civilians as human shields. Government Buildings said that Mr Harris would not respond to “personalised and false attacks” and again suggested that Israel was guilty of war crimes in its attacks on Palestinian territories. A spokesperson for the Taoiseach said: “The Taoiseach will not be responding to personalised and false attacks and remains focused on the horrific war crimes being perpetrated in Gaza, standing up for human rights and international law and reflecting the views of so many people across Ireland who are so concerned at the loss of innocent, civilian lives.” Some 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed in the October 7th, 2023, assault on Israeli communities by Hamas-led gunmen, and more than 250 abducted as hostages into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Israel’s campaign in response has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health authorities, displaced most of the 2.3 million population and destroyed large swathes of the enclave. Earlier, Mr Harris responded to the Israeli decision to close its embassy in Dublin by accusing prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu of using it as a ploy to distract attention from the thousands of children killed by his armed forces in Gaza. In a defiant criticism of the decision, Mr Harris said what was truly reprehensible was the scale of the killing in Gaza and the treatment of its entire population by the Israel Defense Forces. “You know what I think is reprehensible? Killing children, I think that’s reprehensible. You know what I think is reprehensible? Seeing the scale of civilian deaths that we’ve seen in Gaza? You know what I think is reprehensible? People being left to starve and humanitarian aid not flowing.” Mr Harris said he was extremely proud of the stance of Ireland and its people and the manner in which the Government had spoken out against the atrocities in the Middle East. “I think we should be very careful in not falling for what I believe are distractions by the Israeli government. It is deeply regrettable that it decided to shut its embassy. I don’t in any way minimise that decision, but it’s nothing in comparison to what’s happening in the Middle East, absolutely nothing,” he said. The Taoiseach said that Ireland would continue to engage diplomatically with Israel but nobody would silence the State in terms of the views held by people from all parties and all walks of life. He claimed Mr Netanyahu and his government were involved in the “diplomacy of distraction”. “I’d respectfully suggest that, possibly, because it works as a distraction, you’re all here today asking about Ireland’s position. What about Israel’s actions? What about what Netanyahu is doing to the innocent children of Gaza? ... I think it is deeply regrettable that they made that decision.” “We condemn all attacks on Israel. We say Israel has a right to live in peace and security and a right to defend itself. You can say all of those things and still say the next thing, which is that what the Netanyahu government is doing to innocent civilians in Gaza and in the West Bank is utterly despicable and should be condemned by all.” Earlier in Brussels, Tánaiste Micheál Martin denied the Government has been acting in a “hostile” way to Israel in seeking to hold it to account for its actions in its war in Gaza. The Fianna Fáil leader said Ireland’s intervention at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and its previous recognition of the state of Palestine had been motivated by “respect for international humanitarian law”. Mr Martin, who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs, said supporting the ICJ and the International Criminal Court, which has issued an arrest warrant for Mr Netanyahu, should not be viewed as a hostile act. “Recognising a state of Palestine, which we did with Norway and Spain and which other countries have done, is not a hostile act, and should not be seen as a hostile act,” he said. The actions of the Israeli army in northern Gaza, where there are daily reports of the killing of men, women and children, is “beyond any moral compass,” Mr Martin said. “We’ve consistently called for an immediate ceasefire, release of all hostages, and a massive surge of humanitarian aid,” he said. There needed to be “full accountability” for the Israeli military campaign that has destroyed much of Gaza, as well as accountability for Hamas militants who had controlled the Palestinian enclave, and Hizbullah in Lebanon. “Ireland, along with Norway and Spain, have taken a lot of hostility from Israel in respect of the decision to recognise the Palestinian state,” he said. That was despite the fact that the “vast majority” of people had long believed a two-state solution was the only way to resolve the conflict between Israel and Palestine, he said. Mr Martin was speaking on his way into a meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers in Brussels, which will discuss the war in Ukraine, the Middle East, and the situation in Syria following the fall of the Assad regime. - Additional reporting Reuters",0,1
2024/12/16,"Israeli embassy closure the correct move given ‘anti-Israel obsession’ in Ireland, says Dana Erlich Ambassador says ‘Zionist has become a dirty word’ in Ireland and this is ’modernisation of anti-Semitism’ Israel’s decision to close its embassy in Dublin is “the correct move at this juncture”, according to the country’s ambassador to Ireland, who claims there is “an anti-Israel obsession” in the State. In an interview on Monday with Israeli public broadcaster Kan, Dana Erlich said there had been “a systematic hate campaign specifically against me, as the person who represents the state of Israel in Ireland”. She said this involved posters on the streets and negative commentary at demonstrations and that the Government never offered “any condemnation” of what she had faced. Asked by the interviewer if she believed the Irish Government was anti-Semitic and anti-Israel, Ms Erlich replied: “Ultimately, the delegitimisation that Israel has been undergoing, the fact that Zionist has become a dirty word in Ireland – we know that that is the modernisation of anti-Semitism. It is the current incarnation of ancient anti-Semitism. So, to our regret, yes, we see the Irish Government advancing anti-Semitic measures.” Ms Erlich was speaking after the Israeli ministry of foreign affairs on Sunday said it had decided to close the embassy “in light of the extreme anti-Israel policy of the Irish Government”. No specifics as to when the embassy will shut have yet been provided. The move comes at a time of diplomatic tension between the countries over Ireland’s recognition of Palestinian statehood and its participation in the South African lawsuit against Israel at the International Court of Justice over its war on Gaza. Taoiseach Simon Harris on Monday said the decision to close the embassy was a ploy to distract attention from the thousands of children killed by prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s armed forces in Gaza. Ms Erlich was recalled to Israel in May after Ireland, along with Spain and Norway, declared they would unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state. Speaking about her time in Ireland, she said: “Time after time we saw an anti-Israel obsession that doesn’t really help peace or coexistence. There was competition who could make the most extreme anti-Israel statements and there were no voices from the opposition or the media with a different view.” Asked if closing the embassy was the correct move diplomatically, Ms Erlich said it was a difficult decision but the “correct move at this juncture”. “For many years we’ve been considering our presence in Ireland and the presence of the embassy had turned into a source of incitement,” she said during Monday’s interview. “So, this is a message to Ireland and other places: we’ll invest our resources, time, money and energy where there is legitimacy and a supportive government.” She added: “As diplomats we stand on the front line, not just in Ireland but in other difficult countries. But what we see in Ireland is disproportionate, double standards and one-sided and we must decide as a country where to invest our diplomatic resources. We don’t have embassies in every country but our work with Ireland will continue, as will our responsibilities to the Jewish community and the Israelis living there.” Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, a former foreign minister, criticised the current foreign minister Gidon Sa’ar over the decision to close the embassy, saying it was “a victory for anti-Semitism and anti-Israel organisations”. “The way to deal with criticism is not to run away but to stay and fight,” Mr Lapid wrote on X. In response, Mr Sa’ar told Mr Lapid “the era of bowing our heads to haters and persecutors is over” and that he should be ashamed of himself for “choosing to define the Irish attitude towards Israel as ‘criticism’.” Mr Lapid countered: “Israel needs to maintain embassies precisely in places where there is a strong conflict with the government, and a foreign minister who only gives up and runs away from conflict is not doing his job.”",0,1
2024/12/17,"Taoiseach strongly rejects charges of anti-Semitism by Israel’s foreign minister US Chamber of Commerce raised concerns with Irish Government about the Occupied Territories Bill Taoiseach Simon Harris has strongly rejected charges of anti-Semitism by Israel’s foreign minister as relations between the two countries continue to deteriorate. It comes as the Government here confirmed that the US Chamber of Commerce has raised concerns with it about the Occupied Territories Bill, likely to be brought before the Dáil next year. Mr Harris on Monday night pushed back against Israeli charges of anti-Semitism, with Government Buildings describing them as “personalised and false attacks”, and saying that the Taoiseach “remains focused on the horrific war crimes being perpetrated in Gaza, standing up for human rights and international law, and reflecting the views of so many people across Ireland who are so concerned at the loss of innocent civilian lives”. Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar had earlier described the Taoiseach as “Ireland’s anti-Semitic prime minister Simon Harris” while defending Israel’s decision to close its embassy in Dublin in protest at what it described as the anti-Israel policies of the Irish Government. But a senior Government source said that the attack on Mr Harris, and the move to close the Israeli embassy in Dublin, were part of a strategy to distract attention from growing criticism of Israel’s actions in the week of an EU summit, as well as the corruption trial of Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. The latest exchanges come as the Department of Enterprise confirmed the US Chamber of Commerce, the largest business group in the US, raised the Occupied Territories Bill during talks with the Government in Dublin last week. A spokeswoman for the department said that a delegation from the Washington-based lobbying group “raised the Occupied Territories Bill, and Minister (for Enterprise Peter) Burke and his officials noted same”.

In fact I think the people of Ireland would be rather shocked if Ireland’s foreign policy wasn’t founded on the principles of supporting international law, supporting the work of international courts and supporting human rights,” he said. “We condemn all attacks on Israel. We say Israel has a right to live in peace and security, and a right to defend itself. You can say all of those things and still say the next thing, which is that what the Netanyahu government is doing to innocent civilians in Gaza and in the West Bank is utterly despicable and should be condemned by all.”",0,1
2024/12/17,"President Michael D Higgins accuses Israel of ‘deep slander’ over anti-Semitic claims President was responding to comments from Israel’s foreign minister on Monday President Michael D Higgins has said it is a “gross defamation” and “deep slander” for the Israeli government to describe the Irish people as anti-Semitic. “I think it is very important as President of Ireland to say that [for Israel to say] the Irish people are anti-Semitic is a deep slander,” he said. The President was responding to comments by Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar who on Monday accused Ireland of delegitimising and dehumanising Israel, and applying double standards in its response to its war against Hamas in Gaza. President Higgins said: “It is a very serious business to actually brand a people because of the fact they disagree with prime minister [Binyamin] Netanyahu who is in breach of so many bits of international law and has breached the sovereignty of Lebanon, Syria and would like to have settlement in each of them. “To suggest that because one criticises prime minister Netanyahu one is anti-Semitic is such a gross defamation and slander,” he said. President Higgins was speaking at a ceremony for the Ambassador of the State of Palestine Jilan Abdaljamid and Ambassador of Italy Nicola Faganello, both of whom presented their credentials. He said he had initially put down the comments to a lack of experience but had then realised it was part of a pattern to damage Ireland in the eyes of the world. He said that like Tánaiste Micheál Martin and Taoiseach Simon Harris had said on Monday, he wanted to assure the Irish people that the State would not be deflected. “I do want to say how strongly I support the statements from [Mr Harris and Mr Martin],” he said, adding they were right in asserting that Ireland was a country that offered principled support to international law. “Over the years I think it is the Irish psyche that we understand the words ‘dispossession’, ‘occupation’ and so on. “That why we stress the importance of international law and also particularly in relation to the rights obligations of those who are in occupation on what is occupied territory,” he said.",0,1
2024/12/17,"Ireland is ‘extreme against Israel’, says ambassador President Michael D Higgins says accusations of anti-Semitism are ‘gross defamation’ Ireland’s intervention in the genocide case against Israel in the International Criminal Court was the latest in a series of “steps, initiatives, statements” that have caused the Israeli government to regard Ireland as “the most extreme country against Israel internationally” and to close its embassy in Dublin, the Israeli ambassador Dana Erlich has said. Her comments come as President Michael D Higgins hit back at claims from Israel that Ireland’s position was motivated by anti-Semitism as “gross defamation”. In an interview with The Irish Times, Ms Erlich also said that concern in Jerusalem about the Occupied Territories Bill was a “big factor” in the decision to close the embassy. The Bill is regarded by friends and critics of Israel as a significant step in isolating the country and is likely to be reintroduced by the next government. “We see Ireland again trying to promote a step that will isolate and discriminate against Israel,” she said. Ms Erlich warned of rising anti-Semitism in Ireland and said the position of Ireland was well known internationally to be “extreme against Israel”. “When I meet other ambassadors, they ask me, why does Ireland hate Israel?” she said. Unlike the Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar, Ms Erlich did not specifically call Taoiseach Simon Harris anti-Semitic, though she said comments by him were “hateful and incitement” and they were “raising anti-Semitic hostility in Ireland”. Ms Erlich said condemnations of Hamas by the Irish Government and calls for the hostages to be released were “lip service”, adding there were double standards in how Israel was treated. Asked if she believed that criticism of Israel was not linked to Israel’s attacks on Gaza after the October 7th attacks by Hamas, Ms Erlich said: “If that were the case, where is the public outrage for the fact that Israelis were under attack from rocket attacks by Hizbullah since October 8th? “Did the Dáil pass any resolution condemning Hizbullah, holding them accountable for the ongoing rocket attacks? So if you say that it’s about that, then also, why didn’t we see any overblown support for Israel on October 8th? ... We appreciate the condemnation for the atrocities of Hamas, and we appreciate the ongoing calls for the release of hostages, but that cannot only be used as lip service.” But Mr Higgins has said it is a “gross defamation” and “deep slander” for the Israeli government to describe the Irish people as anti-Semitic. “I think it is very important as President of Ireland to say that [for Israel to say] the Irish people are anti-Semitic is a deep slander,” he said. The President was responding to comments by Israel’s foreign minister who on Monday accused Ireland of delegitimising and dehumanising Israel, and applying double standards in its response to its war against Hamas in Gaza.

2024/12/18,"‘Game-changing’ new government jet costing €53m to be acquired next year French-made Dassault Falcon 6X will be a ‘game-changer for the State’s transport, airlift and medical capabilities’, says Tánaiste Micheál Martin A new government jet, costing some €53 million before VAT, is to be acquired next year, the Tánaiste has announced. Micheál Martin, who is also Minister for Defence, said the French-made Dassault Falcon 6X has been selected for the purpose. The aircraft will carry twice as many passengers and have more than twice the range of the Learjet 45, which currently serves as the government jet and has been beset by mechanical problems in recent years. The aircraft has also received a rebrand; instead of being known as the government jet it will be termed a “strategic reach aircraft”. In a statement, Mr Martin emphasised the roles the jet will be used in outside the transportation of ministers and the president. “It will be used for a wide range of tasks, including the non-combatant evacuation of Irish citizens from critical situations, air-ambulance patient transfers, medical evacuation or repatriation of Irish Defence Forces personnel deployed on overseas missions and logistics support for the transport of supplies to Irish Defence Forces overseas missions,” he said. Like the current aircraft, it will form part of the Air Corps’ fleet and will be serviced and flown by Air Corps personnel based at Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel, Dublin. Mr Martin said it would be a “game-changer for the State’s transport, airlift and medical capabilities” and that, with a range of 5,000 nautical miles, it would be able to reach the west coast of the United States without refuelling. “In addition, it will provide the independent and flexible air transport service which is an increasingly essential requirement to assist the government in meeting our national and international obligations,” he added. The Falcon 6X, manufactured by Dassault Aviation SA, is currently under construction at the company’s facility in Bordeaux. The department described it as a “futureproofed, new-generation jet aircraft” which will be more efficient and kinder to the environment. It will be able to operate out of “challenging airfields and in adverse conditions,” it said. The jet is due for delivery next December and will be available in time for Ireland’s presidency of the European Union in the second half of 2026. It will carry up to 14 passengers and three crew compared with the Learjet’s seven passengers and three crew. The €53 million price tag does not include VAT. The ailing Learjet was first acquired in 2004 and is at the end of its service life. On occasion, mechanical failures have forced ministers to make last-minute changes to their travel plans in recent years. Last year, the Government retained a chartered jet company as a backup for ministerial transport for when the Learjet was not working.",0,1
2024/12/19,"Simon Harris hopes Occupied Territories Bill will be passed next year Anti-Semitism accusations are intended to ‘distract’ from deaths of children during war in Gaza, says Taoiseach Taoiseach Simon Harris has said he would be hopeful legislation to ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements would be passed within the first year of the next government. The Occupied Territories Bill was put forward by the Opposition in 2018 but was blocked for years by the Government over concerns it could fall foul of EU trade rules. In the weeks before the general election, the Government committed to supporting a reworked version of the legislation. Speaking on Thursday in Brussels, Mr Harris said he hoped the law would be passed by the Oireachtas next year. “I think that pretty much all parties in the general election committed to passing the Occupied Territories Bill, or a form of the Occupied Territories Bill,” he said. “This is something I would like to see happen and I would like to see it happen in the first year of the government,” he said. Independent Senator Frances Black, who originally introduced the draft law, had been a “very honourable interlocutor” in working with all parties on the text, he said. The Fine Gael leader said comments by Israel’s foreign minister accusing him of anti-Semitism were made to “distract” from the deaths of tens of thousands of children during Israel’s war in Gaza. “What it won’t do is deter us, won’t deter me personally, and won’t deter this Irish Government or the next Irish government from continuing to speak up and speak out in favour of international law,” he said. “I’m passionate about Europe, but we’re not doing enough. We’re not doing nearly enough to end the conflict,” he said. Ireland’s long-standing position in support of Palestine and international law should not come as “any surprise” to US businesses or others, he said. Mr Harris was in Brussels to attend a summit with other leaders of EU states. Mr Harris would not be drawn on speculation that he would become minister for foreign affairs in the next government. Talks are ongoing between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, as well as a group of Independents, with a view to putting together a coalition government. “I believe it is possible for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to put together, with others, a stable government that can deliver five budgets,” Mr Harris said. People did not want government formation talks to descend into lengthy “navel gazing” among politicians. He said it was his hope a coalition agreement would be struck in January. In light of Donald Trump’s election as president in the United States, Europe needed to do an “awful lot more” to make sure it was economically competitive, Mr Harris said. “I think we have to control what we can control, both from a European Union perspective and from an Irish perspective,” he said. He indicated the Government will seek to play on the number of jobs Irish companies create in the US, in an attempt to address Mr Trump’s concerns about the large presence of US companies in Ireland. EU leaders are expected to speak about what more can be done to support Ukraine in its war against Russia, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelling to take part in the discussion. Russia’s bombing of energy infrastructure was a despicable and “inhumane” attempt to freeze the Ukrainian population and leave them in darkness over the winter, Mr Harris said. Talk of EU countries posting peacekeeping troops to Ukraine in the event of a settlement in the conflict was “premature”, given there was “no indication” Russia wanted to move towards peace, he said. “That’s perhaps a conversation for another day. It’d be wonderful to get to the point where we can talk about how we maintain the peace rather than how we end the war,” he said.",0,1
2024/12/2,"Government did not seek EU view on Occupied Territories Bill Argument against draft law to ban trade with Israeli settlements centres on EU trade rules The Government did not seek formal written advice from the European Commission on whether a draft law to ban trade with illegal Israeli settlements would fall foul of European Union rules, records show. The Occupied Territories Bill was put forward by the opposition in 2018 but has remained stuck in the Oireachtas lawmaking pipeline since then. The argument against the draft legislation from Government was previously that trade policy is a competency of the commission, the executive arm of the EU led by EC president Ursula von der Leyen. The draft law was introduced by Independent Senator Frances Black, during the previous Fine Gael-led government that was supported by Fianna Fáil as part of a confidence and supply deal. Records released by the EC following an access-to-information request indicate that neither the outgoing government nor the previous one sought any written advice from the EU body on the Occupied Territories Bill. A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman said successive Irish governments had raised the situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories during “regular and substantive engagement” with EU counterparts. “The Occupied Territories Bill was introduced as a Private Members’ Bill in 2018 and as such was not the focus of the Government’s engagement within the EU on policy on illegal Israeli settlements,” he said. Documents released to The Irish Times show the head of the commission’s trade department did previously advise some TDs and Senators that “in principle” individual member states could not prohibit trade unilaterally. The Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs had sought the views of the commission on the plan to ban trade between Ireland and Israeli settlements in the West Bank and other Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories. In a letter to the committee dated June 5th, 2019, Sabine Weyand, the EC’s director general for trade, said the EU had “exclusive competence” when it came to trade policy. “As a customs union, the EU applies common arrangements for imports of goods from third countries uniformly across the union. In principle, only the EU can decide to prohibit the importation of goods and services and not the member states individually,” she wrote. Ms Weyand told the committee that member states could not adopt their own rules “in the absence of an express authorisation by the EU”. Political focus has returned to the Occupied Territories Bill following Israel’s invasion of Gaza, which has killed more than 44,000 people, according to Hamas-run health authorities in the enclave. Fine Gael leader Simon Harris and Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin have both said the circumstances that blocked the draft legislation previously had now changed, particularly on foot of an opinion from the International Court of Justice. The United Nations’ highest court in July issued an advisory opinion stating that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were in breach of international law. In the weeks before calling the general election, the Government committed to supporting the Bill, following substantial amendments and changes. Passing the revised legislation will be a matter for the incoming government. It is understood Ireland would have to justify breaking with the rest of the EU to ban trade with Israeli settlements on exceptional public policy grounds. As such, the legislation – if passed into law – could set up a potential clash with the next government and the European Commission. Ireland and Spain have consistently pushed for the EU to review its overall trade agreement with Israel, in response to human rights abuses during its military campaign in Gaza. However, such a decision would need to be backed by all 27 member states, which is unlikely to happen.",0,1
2024/12/20,"Public ethics watchdog rules out inquiry into Leo Varadkar’s leak of confidential document Ethics watchdog’s original decision not to investigate was quashed by High Court   The public ethics watchdog has ruled for a second time against an inquiry into Leo Varadkar’s leak of a confidential document when he was taoiseach, after a new review ordered by the High Court. The Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) ruling comes weeks after Mr Varadkar retired from the Dáil by not contesting the November election. The “Leo the leak” affair was a low point in his political career that triggered a Garda investigation, although the Director of Public Prosecutions ruled against criminal charges. Mr Varadkar was heavily criticised for posting a draft 2019 State contract with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) to the home of his friend Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail, then president of the National Association of General Practitioners (NAGP), an IMO rival that is now defunct. Sipo examined the case in 2022 and decided against a preliminary investigation, despite dissenting votes by Comptroller & Auditor General Séamus McCarthy and Ombudsman Ger Deering. That split decision, the first in Sipo’s history, was challenged in the High Court by People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy, one of the original complainants about the leak to the ethics body. In a June ruling, Mr Justice Barry O’Donnell quashed Sipo’s original decision on the basis that it was inadequately reasoned and directed the commission to look again at the Varadkar case. Sipo issued a new 17-page ruling on Thursday to Mr Murphy, citing “careful consideration” of the evidence. “The commission has become of the opinion that there is not sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case that disclosure of the agreement to Dr Ó Tuathail, given his capacity as president of the NAGP, was contrary to the nature and extent of the confidentiality subsisting at the time of disclosure,” the Sipo ruling said. “In addition, even if there was evidence to establish that the agreement was sufficiently sensitive that it ought not to be disclosed, the commission has become of the opinion that  there is not sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case that the respondent [Mr Varadkar] knew of such sensitivity.” The ethics body went on to say the “evidence does not tend to show an ulterior purpose” on behalf of the then taoiseach. Sipo “has not identified prima facie evidence which would contradict” Mr Varadkar’s position that his government had made commitments to engage the NAGP and that he was seeking to advance government policy goals. In his 2021 Garda statement, Mr Varadkar said he provided the document to Dr Ó Tuathail in his NAGP capacity “and not because he was a friend”. Mr Murphy said was “very disappointed that Sipo has decided yet again not to investigate” the leak. “The finding that there isn’t prima facie evidence that the agreement was confidential is extremely tortured and thoroughly unconvincing,” Mr Murphy added. “I’m going to study the decision thoroughly and discuss it further with my legal team and decide in the new year whether I will take further legal action.”",0,1
2024/12/20,"Labour, Soc Dems and Sinn Féin planning ‘strategic co-operation’ as Dáil opposition Independent TDs begin jockeying for ministerial positions in the next government The main Opposition parties on the left are expected to ramp up co-ordination in advance of the likely formation of a new government propped up by Independent TDs. With the Labour Party withdrawing formally from any further discussions on government formation on Thursday, sources in that party, the Social Democrats and Sinn Féin said increased co-operation on the Opposition benches had been discussed during talks between the parties in recent weeks. While the exact nature of closer collaboration has not been fleshed out, a senior Labour source outlined a need for a “more structured and strategic co-operation” in the next Dáil, opposing what they believe will be a significantly more right-leaning coalition. A senior Sinn Féin figure said without a more coherent alternative on display, voters supporting their parties could become disillusioned and disengage from the political process entirely. It comes as Independent TDs begin jockeying for ministerial preference in the next government, with Galway West TD Noel Grealish on Thursday confirming that he would be interested in a post if it became available. An early opportunity for co-operation is expected to come as the Opposition seeks to pile on pressure to quickly progress the Occupied Territories Bill, which seeks to curtail trade with illegal settlements in Palestine. Opposition parties are expected to push for it to pass in the opening months of the year, and closely watch the scope of the Bill, with the Government now on edge about pressure over the Bill from US multinationals. There is growing apprehension in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about the Bill’s prospects, according to senior figures, in the wake of the Israeli decision to close its Dublin embassy. Senior sources fear an intensive lobbying campaign in the US aimed at damaging the Republic economically if it proceeds with the Bill. The prospect of streamlined collaboration on the left is by no means assured. Labour leader Ivana Bacik said on Thursday that her party’s priority was forming closer links with the Social Democrats and the Greens, but that significant policy differences remained with Sinn Féin. Nonetheless, sources in the three parties said closer co-ordination in Opposition had been a theme in their discussions. This is expected to take the form of more meetings at leader level and between whips, while party figures also suggested that co-ordination on Private Members’ time and Leaders’ Questions could arise. However, any formal agreement, much less an electoral pact, is not being considered by any party. Housing, health, climate, childcare, and employment rights were all pinpointed as potential areas for co-operation. However, Labour believes Sinn Féin’s climate and migration policies do not align with its own. That view is not shared by senior figures in Sinn Féin who are enthusiastic about building links — partially to target the presumed incoming government, but also to counteract the growth of smaller conservative parties and the far right. While the Social Democrats continued talks with Fine Gael yesterday, it is widely expected in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that they will form a coalition with support drawn from the eight-strong Regional Group of Independents. The Social Democrats expect to stay in government talks over Christmas and to meet again with Fianna Fáil. Its next step is to convene its parliamentary party after Christmas. However, one senior figure acknowledged the party would face a similar issue to Labour if it wanted to see its policies implemented — insufficient leverage in the presence of a viable alternative and the lower number of TDs the larger parties need to form a majority. Meanwhile, it is understood that work is ongoing to finalise a document containing policy issues that the Regional Group want to see implemented if government-formation talks are successful. The document includes demands in the areas of housing, health and disability services.",0,1
2024/12/20,"‘Leo the leak’ affair still lingers five years on Sipo has resolved for a second time not to investigate the leaking of a draft State contract with the Irish Medical Organisation when Varadkar was taoiseach Leo Varadkar left the Dáil three weeks ago but the “Leo the leak” affair that tarnished his reputation lived on, if only because it was still subject to review by the public ethics watchdog. Now the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) has resolved for a second time not to investigate the leak. Will this be the end of it? The answer is largely in the hands of Paul Murphy, the People Before Profit TD who took High Court action that led to a June ruling to quash Sipo’s original split decision not to investigate the leak. Mr Murphy will decide whether he takes “further legal action” in the new year. More than five years have passed since Varadkar, then taoiseach, sent a draft State contract with the Irish Medical Organisation to his friend Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail, leader of the National Association of General Practitioners (NAGP), an IMO rival that is now defunct. Varadkar must regret that now. When Village magazine landed the scoop on the leak, there were political ructions. The affair spawned a Garda investigation, a Director of Public Prosecutions file, High Court litigation, a Dáil apology, a confidence motion and not one but two Sipo reviews. Sipo’s 2022 decision was struck down six months ago by Mr Justice Barry O’Donnell when he said its explanations for not carrying out an inquiry were inadequately reasoned. That was the ruling that led to Sipo’s new decision on Thursday, in a 17-page document that finally breaks six months of silence since the judge struck down the original decision. That decision of 2022 was grounded in Sipo’s view that it had “no role and/or remit to consider either the lawfulness of the action or the extent of the powers of the office of Taoiseach”. There were two dissenters within Sipo: Comptroller and Auditor General Séamus McCarthy and Ombudsman Ger Deering. Freedom of Information disclosures showed McCarthy warning of “credibility” issues for Sipo over its rejection of complaints against Varadkar. “A court order to reconsider rejection of a complaint would be appalling, and would compromise the credibility of any subsequent decision we made,” McCarthy wrote in 2022. “A court order to stop an inquiry would at least explain why we had no power to pursue a complaint in this matter.” The “appalling” outcome came to pass in the O’Donnell ruling, raising inevitable questions now about the credibility of the new decision in the case. The outcome is the same: no investigation into Varadkar. But Sipo has changed the argument. Gone are questions over its role or capacity to consider the lawfulness of a taoiseach’s action or the powers of the office of taoiseach. Instead, the new decision is predicated on whether the leak was a “disclosure in breach of a confidence” or a “disclosure for an improper purpose”. After considering the complaints afresh, Sipo found the leak was neither a breach of confidence nor a disclosure for improper objectives. On the first point, Sipo said the sequence of events supports Varadkar’s “contention that he considered the agreement to have lost sensitivity, taking into account the announcement of the agreement by the Government and its approval at Cabinet”. Varadkar’s position was that Ó Tuathail, as NAGP president, was a legitimate stakeholder such that disclosure to him “would not be contrary to the nature and extent of ‘confidentiality’ subsisting at the time”. Sipo said it did not find evidence to contradict that. The watchdog said the only evidence “which might be interpreted as suggesting an ulterior purpose is that which is attributed to Mr Chay Bowes” in Village magazine. Bowes is a healthcare entrepreneur who was at the time working with the NAGP. That evidence was limited to two points, Sipo said. First, Bowes’s recollection of conversations with Ó Tuathail in which Ó Tuathail was alleged to claim influence with Varadkar. Second was a text message from Ó Tuathail to Bowes attaching a photo of the contract in which Ó Tuathail stated: “To be fair. Leo always delivers.” Sipo considered whether it should confirm that evidence directly with Bowes, but decided it was unnecessary. “Even assuming the credibility and cogency of the evidence, the commission’s opinion is that the evidence does not tend to show an ulterior purpose on behalf of the respondent,” it said, referring to Varadkar. “Taken at its highest, the commission is of the opinion that this evidence tends to demonstrate Dr Ó Tuathail’s subjective perception of his own influence with [Varadkar], but is not probative as to the respondent’s purpose at the time of disclosure.” Varadkar has left Leinster House so Sipo’s latest move has no impact on his political fortunes. But the case is still critical for Sipo itself. After a damaging loss of face in court, the big question now is whether this new decision holds.",0,1
2024/12/20,"Key Regional Independent TD says there will not be ministerial jobs for all in government formation negotiations Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran says incoming taoiseach will make appointments and ‘it’s only fair not to make demands’  Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran – a key member of the Regional Group of Independent TDs jobs involved in government formation efforts – has said there will not be ministerial jobs for all of them, that the incoming taoiseach will make appointments and “it’s only fair not to make demands”. His comments come after another member of the Regional Group of Independents, Galway West TD Noel Grealish, confirmed he would be interested in a ministerial role for himself. Winning the support of members of the group is seen as the most likely route for a potential coalition between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to achieving a Dáil majority. Mr Moran, a Longford-Westmeath TD, served as a junior minister in the Fine Gael-led minority government that was in office between 2016 and 2020. He denied that there was annoyance in the Regional Group that Mr Grealish had publicly said he was interested in being a minister, saying “he told us” and the group is “all a good bunch of people”. Asked if he too would be interested in a ministerial role, he said he wants “a good Programme for Government and being able deliver it over five years.” He said he wanted to make sure the government lasts its full term, adding that the people want “stability” and “I will work to make sure that works.” He also said: “I don’t think there’s jobs for us all so we have to talk as group and see what’s available but it’s up to the incoming taoiseach to appoint the ministers and it’s only fair not to make demands.” He said: “I want us all to work together and trust one another.” Mr Moran declined to offer details of a document containing policy issues that Regional Group of Independents want to see implemented if government talks are successful. He said: “I personally don’t think we should make it available to press” adding that it should “part of the overall program with our partners Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and put as the five year plan”. Mr Moran also said: “I was there before in government and five-year programme is better then us all trying to take credit for this and that.” On Thursday, Mr Grealish said “Government negotiations are ongoing and I believe in the importance of ensuring a robust Programme for Government, which addresses policy issues, the concerns of the Irish people, issues of relevance for Ireland nationally and internationally and the constituency of Galway West.” He said he remained “in active discussions with my regional group colleagues, which is headed up by Michael Lowry TD” and all of its members “have an equal part to play to develop this Programme for Government”. Mr Grealish also said “discussions at this stage are focused on policy”. “The issue of ministerial roles has not been discussed thus far, however I wish to confirm that I am interested in such a position, if it becomes available at a later stage of negotiations.”",0,1
2024/12/23,"Taoiseach expresses ‘unbreakable support’ to people of Palestine during call with Abbas Simon Harris says call was made to express ‘solidarity’ between people of Ireland and Palestine Taoiseach Simon Harris has expressed the “unbreakable support” of the people of Ireland to the people of Palestine during a call with Mahmoud Abbas on Monday. The phone call between Mr Harris and the West Bank-based President of the Palestinian Authority comes against the backdrop of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and Ireland’s recognition of the Palestinian State earlier this year. Mr Harris said he used the call “to express the solidarity and unbreakable support of the people of Ireland to the people of Palestine.” He added: “I told Mahmoud Abbas that the heartbreaking conditions and loss of innocent life in Gaza this year weighs heavily on the minds of many Irish people as they gather with their families for Christmas this week. “I also pledged that Ireland will continue to use its voice and its influence at every opportunity in every international forum it can from the EU to the UN – as well as through direct bilateral relations with Israel and Palestine – to bring about a ceasefire and to start to rebuild shattered lives.” Mr Harris also said: “While speaking to President Abbas it was foremost in my mind that the heart-shattering milestone of more than 45,000 dead was passed earlier this month, of which nearly 15,000 were innocent children.” He relayed how Mr Abbas had told him an average of 50 people have died and 100 have been injured in Gaza for every day in 2024. Mr Harris added: “On top of this we have seen so called safe zones bombed in the last few days and the conditions in Gaza as described by the UN are horrific.” He said that 1.1 million children are “living in hellish conditions” and families lack basic items like food, clothing, shoes, mattresses, blankets, and kitchen supplies. Mr Harris said there is “a dangerous shortage of medicines, with diseases spreading rapidly due to the cold” and “tens of thousands of people are living at sites with no basic services at all. “That’s no bathroom, no water and no food.” The Taoiseach also said: “It is also deeply troubling that the West Bank and East Jerusalem continue to see buildings being cleared and demolished.” He raised concern that the risk of famine in Gaza has not subsided and “the only conclusion that can fairly be drawn at the end of the 2024 is that the world has failed the innocent people of Gaza.” Mr Harris and Mr Abbas spoke of the importance of ongoing international support United Nations relief agency Unrwa to keep Gaza’s fragile education and health system standing. They also discussed the first group of eight seriously injured Palestinian children being medically evacuated to Ireland this week for treatment. A Government statement said: “the leaders looked forward to 2025 and the need for a ceasefire and an end to the bloodshed to be the top priority of all major powers and parties to the conflict. “The Taoiseach pledged Ireland would use every opportunity to achieve this.” Like Ireland, Spain and Norway also recognised Palestine earlier this year. Mr Abbas is said to have thanked Ireland for this recognition again during the call. He also said that the Palestinian Ambassador, Dr Jilan Abdalmajid, officially presenting her credentials to Ireland this week was a great honour. Mr Harris said: “There were some who criticised our decision to recognise Palestine but I am resolute in the words I said on that day in May, ‘there is never a wrong time to do the right thing’.” Mr Harris said: “Many leaders whose countries have yet to recognise the state of Palestine have expressed their respect towards Ireland, Spain and Norway’s decision.” He also said: “Our recognition of Palestine took nothing away from Israel and I have spoken or met in person with President Herzog of Israel on several occasions this year.” Israel closed its embassy in Dublin earlier this month claiming “extreme” anti-Israel policies by the Irish Government. At the time Mr Harris described the decision as “regrettable” and denied that the Irish Government has anti-Israeli policies, describing its stance as “pro-peace, pro-human rights and pro-international law”. A Government statement after the call said that Ireland has once again called for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza, the free flow of urgently needed humanitarian aid and the release of all Israeli hostages to their families.",0,1
2024/12/24,"Micheál Martin calls for ceasefires in Sudan and Gaza as regions are threatened by famine Tánaiste says hunger caused by conflicts is being exacerbated by denial of humanitarian aid by warring parties Tánaiste Micheál Martin has called for an immediate ceasefire in the conflicts in both Sudan and Gaza as unprecedented levels of hunger are declared across both regions. Two bodies charged by the humanitarian community with monitoring food insecurity for the world’s most vulnerable communities have issued stark reports on Sudan and Gaza, describing as catastrophic the scale and intensity of hunger caused by the conflict and the deliberate denial of humanitarian access by the warring parties. In Sudan, famine has been declared in multiple locations across the country, on a scale which has not been seen in a century, the Tánaiste said. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system has declared famine in five areas, affecting over a half a million people, with a further five areas due to enter famine conditions in the next few months. Although not yet confirmed by the formal IPC process, in Gaza the famine early warning systems network has determined that famine thresholds have been reached (IPC 5) in the North Gaza Governate. “Both of these catastrophes are man-made – caused by conflict, forced displacement, destruction of civilian infrastructure, and deliberate obstruction of humanitarian aid,” Mr Martin said. “Ireland calls for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan and for full and unimpeded humanitarian access to halt this entirely preventable horror.” The ongoing siege in northern Gaza was “unconscionable” and there was a strong likelihood that famine was imminent, he said. “Humanitarian access continues to be severely curtailed by the Israeli authorities ... We call for an end to the ongoing military operation in Gaza,” Mr Martin said.",0,1
2024/12/24,"New government unlikely to be formed before Dáil returns on January 22nd Government formation talks to ‘intensify’ in new year but sources say ratification will take time Talks between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will resume with significantly greater urgency in the new year, according to sources involved in the process, when the parties hope to be in a position to finalise agreements with several Independents – possibly including the Healy-Raes – ahead of the return of the Dáil on January 22nd. “There’s a need to intensify the whole thing in the new year,” said one person involved. However, sources in both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil expressed doubts about whether the process will be completed in time for the next meeting of the Dáil, as both parties will need to go through a process of ratifying any deal in accordance with their own internal rules. Fianna Fáil rules mean that a special ardfheis must be held to approve the deal, while Fine Gael is likely hold a series of regional conferences to discuss and vote on any agreement. The notice period required could push the date for acceptance of any deal towards the end of January. Negotiations with Independent TDs will also resume in the new year, Government sources say. Opinion is divided among people involved about whether Michael and Danny Healy-Rae are ultimately likely to support a coalition led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Michael Healy-Rae told The Irish Times last week that talks with Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin had gone well and that the “three-legged stool” of the proposed Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-regional Independents government could become a “four-legged chair” with the inclusion of the Healy-Raes. Two senior Government sources expressed the view that the Kerry TDs were serious about supporting a new coalition but others expressed scepticism. Looking ahead to a new programme for government, business representative organisation Dublin Town has been lobbying both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael asking that they commit to implementing the recommendations of a taskforce report for revitalising the capital. The taskforce was set up by Taoiseach Simon Harris last May after riots in the city centre in November 2023. It made 10 recommendations including the deployment of 1,000 extra gardaí to the city’s streets, additional city-centre housing and the regulation of charities providing tents to homeless people. Dublin Town chief executive Richard Guiney told The Irish Times that he wrote to members of the two big parties’ government formation talks teams – Jack Chambers of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe telling them the implementation of the Taskforce recommendations is “critical for Dublin”. He said: “Dublin is at a point where things haven’t been moving in the right direction since the pandemic and a bit before that as well. I think we can reverse that direction.” Mr Guiney, who was part of the taskforce, said there was a “need to enhance the perceptions of safety” in the capital and “We need to rejuvenate areas like O’Connell Street and the northside in general”. Fine Gael’s election manifesto promised to implement the taskforce recommendations. Asked about Dublin Town’s lobbying, Mr Donohoe said on Monday: “Dublin continues to be a great city, but it needs to do better. “I expect the next government will continue the focus on this by the implementation of the Taoiseach’s taskforce on the city centre.”",0,1
2024/12/28,"Ireland needs to launch diplomatic offensive in response to Trump’s return - Taoiseach  US president-elect’s goals could hit investment, jobs and corporate tax receipts here, Harris warns Ireland needs to “launch an all-out diplomatic and trade offensive” in the United States to respond to the potential fallout from Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. Irish Government Ministers have already been warned about the potential impact of Mr Trump’s tax and trade policies, which could hit investment, jobs and corporate tax receipts. His stated goal is to bring US investment back to the United States and, as the location for the international headquarters of many big US companies, Ireland would be exposed if this happens. Mr Trump’s inauguration takes place on January 20th. Writing in today’s edition of The Irish Times, Mr Harris outlines how Mr Trump will be back in the Oval Office after a “comprehensive” election victory and a “strengthened” mandate including control of both the US House of Representatives and the Senate. He says Mr Trump will use this “to fulfil his election promises, including promises that may affect Ireland, such as the lowering of business taxes stateside”. The Fine Gael leader also highlights “the possibility of an international trade shock through tariffs” and how “a small, open economy like ours would be susceptible to the fallout”. “Ireland has no time to waste” and it will not be enough to wait until the annual St Patrick’s Day visit to the White House, he adds. “The new Irish government needs to launch an all-out diplomatic and trade offensive in the United States from late January onwards,” Mr Harris writes. Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is likely to assume the role of taoiseach if his party and Fine Gael can reach a coalition deal, mostly likely with the support of members of the Regional Group of Independents. Mr Harris and Mr Martin have previously expressed their hope a new government can be formed here before Mr Trump returns to office. However, sources in both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have expressed doubts about whether the government formation process can be completed in time for the next meeting of the Dáil on January 22nd. This is because both parties will need to go through a process of ratifying any deal in accordance with their own internal rules. Writing in The Irish Times, Mr Harris says he spoke to Mr Trump in November and “his attitude towards Ireland and the US-Ireland relationship was notably warm and informed”. He also says the “chess pieces for an Irish diplomatic and trade offensive are already on the board” between Ireland’s Embassy team in Washington DC and the network of consulates across the US. The “vast networks” in the US of agencies like IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland “must again be worked to maximum effect”, he adds. Mr Harris says Ireland was a “top-10 investor” in the US and about 500 Irish companies alone employ 100,000 people there and “this is the story we need to tell Mr Trump’s new team”. The Taoiseach also outlines how he had proposed to the European Council that Mr Trump be invited to a US-EU summit. “That may happen in the coming year at some point, but Ireland should make it our ambition to host the US president in Ireland at such a summit during our presidency of the EU in 2026,” he says.",0,1
2024/12/30,"Fine Gael set to ratify swathe of new candidates for Seanad Éireann panels Party aiming to target constituencies where second or third seat could be won in future general elections The Fine Gael national executive council is set to ratify a swathe of new candidates for Seanad Éireann panels, with the party aiming to target constituencies where a second or third seat could be won in future general elections. A Seanad election to fill 60 seats is ongoing. Incoming TDs (160), outgoing Senators (60) and local authority councillors (just under 1,000) elect 43 Senators on five vocational panels. The Taoiseach of the incoming government gets to decide on 11 Senators. Three Senators are elected by graduates of NUI colleges. Three Senators are elected by graduates of Trinity College (University of Dublin). In the next Seanad election graduates of any designated institution of higher education in Ireland aged 18 years or over, who are Irish citizens, will be eligible to be electors in a new six-seat higher education constituency. The Fine Gael executive council plans to ratify in the new year a full list of candidates for all panels. Internal strategists are aiming to present Fine Gael as a party undergoing a period of “renewal”, with 22 of its 38 TDs having been elected for the first time in the November general election. “The next stage of that renewal will be the Seanad Election,” a source said. Fine Gael wants to see candidates elected in constituencies and counties where there were no Fine Gael TDs elected in November, and in constituencies where the party believes it can win a second or third seat. The candidates expected to be nominated to contest the election on the inside sub-panels are: Cllr Conor Bergin (Laois), Cllr Vicki Casserly (Dublin Mid-West), Cllr Noel O’Donovan (Cork), Senator Garret Ahearn (Tipperary South), John McNulty (Donegal), Leonora Carey (Clare), Cllr Mark Duffy, (Mayo), Cllr Mike Kennelly (Kerry), Senator Alan Farrell (Dublin Fingal East), Cllr David Fitzgerald (Kilkenny), Cllr Carmel Brady, (Cavan), Cllr Cathal Byrne (Wexford), Senator Mary Seery Kearney (Dublin South Central). In particular constituencies the party is focusing on include Cork South-West, Wexford and Meath West – where Fine Gael hope to see Cllr Noel O’Donovan, Cllr Cathal Bryne and Cllr Linda Nelson Murray elected. The party is also zeroing in on Cllr Mark Duffy in Mayo and Leonora Carey in Clare. Seanad elections have to take place within 90 days of the dissolution of the Dáil. Candidates can be nominated by four members of the Oireachtas or a nominating body.",0,1
2024/12/31,"Meta executive told Taoiseach Europe should have ‘open approach’ to AI development Nick Clegg contacted Simon Harris in the summer and also met him in Dublin in December Senior Meta executive Nick Clegg contacted Taoiseach Simon Harris to highlight his view that Europe should “embrace an open approach” to Artificial Intelligence (AI) development. His remarks came in an email to the Fine Gael leader after the European elections in June and the pair have also since met in Dublin in December. Mr Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister, is Meta’s president for global affairs. Meta owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and has been developing AI products, some of which have been delayed in Europe with the tech giant citing issues with the regulatory system for this. In June Mr Clegg wrote an online article headlined: “The new European Parliament faces an existential crisis”. He wrote that “Europe’s regulatory complexity and the patchwork of laws across different member states often makes companies hesitant to roll out new products here.” Mr Clegg added: “Meta, Google and others have delayed rolling out their AI assistants here, and even European success stories like Volkswagen are increasingly leaving to build and launch their AI products in the US.” He also wrote that European leaders have stated they want Europe to compete with the US and China in tech but argued “we [Europe] have been held back by our failure to properly complete the digital single market”. Mr Clegg said a digital start-up in Amsterdam would “have to navigate 27 different intellectual property laws, various rules for the licensing of content, data protection authorities and other obstacles before it could go live across the Continent”. Records released by the Department of the Taoiseach under the Freedom of Information Act show that Mr Clegg emailed Mr Harris on June 27th to share the article. Mr Clegg said “Europe is at a turning point” and raised concern that the Continent’s companies “are growing more slowly, reporting lower returns and lagging behind peers in research and development”. He said: “I believe Europe can change its trajectory by playing to its strength – the European Single Market” and that this “represents over 450 million consumers, but isn’t complete”. Mr Clegg added: “It should also embrace an open approach to AI development – taking advantage of open source AI models will give European businesses, start-ups and researchers access to tools they wouldn’t otherwise get their hands on.” He told Mr Harris: “I hope you find it [his article] interesting.” Meta did not offer comment on Mr Clegg’s contacts with Mr Harris. A statement from the Department of the Taoiseach said Mr Harris met Mr Clegg in Dublin on December 5th when “the Taoiseach reiterated the Government’s commitment to maintaining Ireland’s position as a digital leader, in Europe and beyond, as outlined in our National Digital Strategy”. It added: “This includes the Government’s commitment to providing a strong, well-resourced network of regulators to oversee and enforce digital regulations, in a way which ensures the safety of our citizens while also promoting innovation.” Mr Harris is also said to have reiterated points he made at the US-Ireland Economic Summit hosted in October when he referenced the Draghi Report on EU Competitiveness. The statement said the report by former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi “highlights a significant opportunity for the EU to lead in the next wave of innovation, in AI and other advanced technologies”. Mr Harris “welcomed Draghi’s call to accelerate innovation in the EU, to tackle our productivity challenges and to remove barriers that prevent innovative companies from growing and attracting finance”.

2024/12/4,"Analysis: What next for climate policy now the Greens are out of government? A campaign where the main parties downplayed climate issues and shunned hard choices bodes ill for ambitious climate policies in the next programme for government With the Greens drummed out of office, answering the critical question of how the new government addresses a worsening climate crisis – that failed to ignite as an election issue – hinges on political combinations. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael favour a third party as coalition partner rather than Independents, with a preference for Labour. The Social Democrats forced their way into the picture with a strong showing. The two smaller, left-leaning parties were adjudged to have the best climate policies (even ahead of the Greens) in independent analysis commissioned by Friends of the Earth. That might provide assurance on necessary climate ambition within the next government should they be involved, but neither seems keen – and certainly not if either of the two stays out. The next obvious option is Independents. Dr Tara Shine, chief executive of sustainability consultants ChangeByDegrees, says it is “a shame the Greens got burned” and blamed for the cost of living which had nothing to do with green/climate policy. The Labour and Soc Dems combination could ensure strong accountability, she says, as good as the Greens or even better, especially on building understanding that “housing justice and climate justice are part of the same thing”. Going with Independents will slow the response, although legal commitments and compliance with EU regulations still apply, Shine says. Delays will lead to frustration, escalating costs (and fines) and “unhelpful signals to markets”. “It won’t be easy. It won’t change the [overall] direction of travel… but slowing down will be bad for Ireland,” she warns, and make it harder for businesses already going in the right direction. Climate policy specialist Sadhbh O’Neill, who failed to win a Labour seat in Waterford, says “it feels like the election took place inside a bubble of denial and delay”. She is fearful of how parties will tackle more challenging topics like data centres, high electricity costs and sustainable land use, “because if the next government doesn’t act we’re all in big, big trouble”. From a climate policy perspective, the likely combination will be “disastrous”. It’s not that everything will backslide, she says, but what’s already backsliding – on agriculture, land use and forestry – will continue. The Climate Act mandates governments to reduce carbon emissions, while they must comply with carbon budgets and meet Paris Agreement obligations. Even if it wants to shun more radical or penal actions, the climate to-do list is substantial. The new coalition has to agree a 2025 climate action plan, to adjust measures where sectoral emission ceilings are being exceeded and set a 2026-2030 carbon budget. It must scale up ambition in advance of the UN Cop30 summit – not just on slashing emissions but setting out how they can be achieved. O’Neill says current targets are off-course and may worsen, though last year Ireland lowered its emissions significantly. Even if the Greens were in government, it’s questionable if they could persuade senior partners to bridge the gap with unpopular measures. Sitting on hands will be evident which will please the aviation sector and data centres, she predicts. The State must lead transformation of our energy, transport, housing and food systems “to make zero-pollution options accessible, affordable and appealing for all in a way that reduces poverty and inequality”, says Friends of the Earth chief executive Oisín Coghlan. Judging by their manifestos, Labour, the Soc Dems, the Greens, People Before Profit and Sinn Féin share that analysis, and so can be an effective opposition in “holding [government] feet to the fire”. “It’s crucial to present climate action as a way to improve the quality of life for everyone now, not just for those who can afford electric cars or expensive retrofits. And not just to safeguard our children’s future, fundamental as that is,” he says. He doesn’t see the election outcome as a vote against climate action, citing a striking finding in the exit poll; 51 per cent of voters thought the outgoing government “has not gone far enough to address climate change”, compared to 20 per cent who thought they had gone too far. Crucially, 47 per cent of Fianna Fáil voters and 44 per cent of Fine Gael voters thought the Government they led had not gone far enough. Only 14 per cent of them thought it went too far, compared to 46 per cent of Independent Ireland voters. “Anti-Green sentiment inside Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil may be the squeaky wheel, but it doesn’t represent what those parties’ voters think about climate action.” So what of the Independents? Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan observed some “define themselves by their opposition to the green transition”. Others acknowledge climate disruption to farming yet reject the science or need for corrective action. Meanwhile, the crisis gets worse with more extreme impacts inevitable in an unprepared Ireland. An election campaign where the main parties wanted to downplay climate issues, with manifestos lacking focus on hard choices, does not bode well for ambitious climate policies in the next programme for government. It will require an exceptional climate minister with relentless focus and understanding of energy dynamics and climate science to overcome that mindset and to counter the backsliders.",0,1
2024/12/5,"Fianna Fáil seeking to reclaim old Leinster House meeting rooms from Fine Gael Party requests return to coveted fifth-floor meeting rooms, which it lost in 2011, now its Dáil numbers have risen  Fianna Fáil is seeking to reclaim its old party meeting rooms in Leinster House from Fine Gael after a general election result in which it won 10 more Dáil seats than its rival. Tánaiste Micheál Martin’s party lost the coveted meeting rooms on the fifth floor — which it had used since the 1960s — after its disastrous 2011 election performance when the party returned with just 20 seats. However, with 48 TDs elected last week, and the prospect of more senators to follow, Fianna Fáil is seeking to be returned to its old meeting rooms. The Irish Times understands the issue was discussed at a meeting between officials from political parties and the Houses of the Oireachtas and that Fianna Fáil’s request to move meeting rooms was initiated on Thursday. Fianna Fáil declined to comment on the matter. It is unclear whether Fine Gael will resist the request. A party source said: “I don’t think the allocation of party rooms is the most important thing to the people that voted last Friday.” Fianna Fáil held its first parliamentary party meeting of the new Dáil on Wednesday. Afterwards, Mr Martin said it had been “a good gathering” and “certainly it reflected the success we’ve had in the general election with the increase in seats”. “It’s only when you see everybody in the room, not everybody was in the room, but we actually ran out of seats with the numbers that we now have,” he added. “And if I cast my mind back to a meeting we had in Tallaght in the aftermath of the 2011 general election, when we had essentially 20 or 19 members attending on that occasion, we’ve come on a significant journey from then.”",0,1
2024/12/5,"Troubles Legacy Act: Tánaiste welcomes UK action to ‘substantively reform’ legislation  Reform of Act ‘must command the confidence of victims and survivors,’ says Martin    Tánaiste Micheál Martin has welcomed “first steps” being taken by the UK government to repeal and replace controversial UK legislation designed to address the legacy of the Troubles. In a House of Commons statement on Wednesday Northern Secretary Hilary Benn said the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023, introduced by the previous Conservative government, halted scores of civil cases and inquests into Troubles deaths.  He said this was “wrong” and “too many families” have had to “wait too long to find out what happened to their loved ones.” The Act was opposed by many victims’ groups in Northern Ireland and all the main Stormont parties. On Thursday the Tánaiste responded, saying he noted Mr Benn’s remarks “outlining his plans to give effect to the British government’s commitment to repeal and replace the Legacy Act.” Mr Martin said he had discussions with the secretary of state on a range of issues related to Northern Ireland, including the Legacy Act, at the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Dublin, on Tuesday. “In our discussions, and in his speech to the House of Commons, the secretary of state has outlined a pathway to substantively reform the Act and that is welcome.” Mr Martin said “more work remains to be done, and we will continue and intensify discussions to this end. As I have stated previously, the key tests for the Irish Government in respect of reforms of the Legacy Act are compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, and the ability to command the confidence of victims and survivors. “I will have a further chance to talk to the secretary of state about this issue over the next couple of days at the British-Irish Council Summit in Edinburgh”, Mr Martin said.",0,1
2024/12/5,"Government talks: Social Democrats to meet Sinn Féin, Labour and Fianna Fáil  Cian O’Callaghan says party wants change in direction on issues such as housing, health care, child care and disability The deputy leader of the Social Democrats, Cian O’Callaghan has said that his party would be willing to go into government if there is a change in direction on issues such as housing, health care, child care and disability. “We will be meeting Sinn Féin today, the Labour Party tomorrow and Fianna Fáil shortly. We’ve also asked to meet with Fine Gael and with all of these parties we will be outlining key issues for us that we want to see worked on in this new dialogue and indeed in the next government,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. Mr O’Callaghan said the Social Democrats would be asking for support for their position on key areas. “Because regardless of who’s in the next government, we’re strongly of the view that there needs to be a change direction in these areas and we want to be constructive and we want to put forward our solutions, our policy proposals in these areas to the other parties,” the Dublin Bay North TD said. “If we can get openness from other parties to make significant changes in approach, then certainly we are interested in going into government. And we haven’t started those discussions. But over the next coming days, we should have a clearer picture on this.” Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil TD James Lawless told the same programme he was pleased to see such a “spirit of constructive collaboration” from the Social Democrats in their approach to talks and said that his party would reciprocate as the talks with all parties and individuals were about finding common ground. As the party with the most seats, the onus was on Fianna Fáil to lead the next government, he said. “But of course we’re open to suggestions and input and talking to prospective parties about what their particular views are and then seeing what we can agree on together.”",0,1
2024/12/6,"‘Don’t take Fine Gael for granted’: Simon Harris on Government formation talks with Fianna Fáil Taoiseach says his party’s mandate must be respected, while Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin also raises the issue of Rockall in Scotland, where both leaders were attending a British-Irish summit  Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach Simon Harris has warned politicians from other parties not to “take my party for granted” in Government coalition talks. “It would be very difficult to form any Government without Fine Gael’s participation,” he said, answering a question about whether his party might have accept being a junior partner in coalition with Fianna Fáil, which won 10 Dáil seats more than Fine Gael. “Parity of esteem has always been an important concept in coalition gov. It’s about the glue that holds a Government together.” Mr Harris said he didn’t want to “finger point”, in response to a suggestion that elements within Fianna Fáil were being “presumptuous” about the make-up of the next government. The Irish Times reported that Fianna Fáil sources said they wanted extra sway over Fine Gael at Cabinet. “I wouldn’t take my party for granted. Fewer public musings and more concrete engagement is the way to proceed,” said the Taoiseach. “There is far too much presumption in relation to Government talks before talks have even taken place.” Mr Harris said his party had received 458,000 first preference votes in the election. “Those people are going to be heard and respected,” he said. The Taoiseach was speaking at the British Irish Council summit in Edinburgh, which was also attended by UK prime minister Keir Starmer and the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and the North, as well the leaders of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. He said he had appointed a negotiating team and would speak to them today upon his return to Ireland. He said he hoped to open formal negotiations with a number of parties next week. He left open the possibility that Independent TDs could be offered Cabinet seats as part of Government formation talks, saying he “wouldn’t rule anything in or out” on the matter. Separately, Fianna Fáil leader and Tánaiste Micheál Martin raised with the Scottish Government the issue of granting access to Irish fishing vessels to the eaters around Rockall, a disputed islet in the North Atlantic over which Britain claims sovereignty. John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, confirmed to The Irish Times that Mr Martin had raised the issue with him directly. Scotland and Ireland had hammered out an access deal for Irish fishing boats earlier this year, but it was vetoed in May by the UK’s then-foreign secretary, David Cameron. When asked if that deal could now be revived, Mr Swinney said his administration would “engage constructively with the Government of the Republic “to try to find a way forward to address the issues that are of concern”. Mr Harris and Mr Martin both skipped the press conference after the BIC on Friday afternoon due to the weather warnings for the West coast. Mr Starmer was the first UK prime minister to attend the working part of a BIC meeting in at least 15 years, although he skipped the summit dinner on Thursday night to attend a Labour Party event in Glasgow. Mr Harris praised the prime minister for attending the working part of the BIC, which had been effectively ignored by Downing Street in the Tory years. “I want to acknowledge that leadership from prime minister Starmer. It is a really important step forward,” said the Taoseach.",0,1
2024/12/6,"Katherine Zappone enters Seanad election race Former Independent minister is seeking to be elected to the Seanad for the University of Dublin constituency Former Independent minister and high-profile LGBT-rights campaigner Katherine Zappone is making a bid to be elected to the Seanad for the University of Dublin constituency. Ms Zappone – who served as minister for children in the 2016 to 2020 Fine Gael-led minority government – handed in her election papers at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) on Friday. Originally from the United States, Ms Zappone is a co-founder of the An Cosán adult education centre and is a former TCD lecturer. She was previously a member of the Seanad between 2011 and 2016 having been appointed by then-taoiseach Enda Kenny. In 2016 she was the first Independent politician to sign up to join his minority government and she secured a cabinet seat as part of the deal. She moved to New York after she lost her Dáil seat in the 2020 general election. There was controversy the following year after a bid by then-minister for foreign affairs Simon Coveney to appoint her as a special envoy on freedom of expression to the United Nations, a newly created role that came with €15,000-a-year in pay. She ultimately declined the job amid the political row that ensued, saying at the time: “it is clear that criticism of the appointment process has impacted the legitimacy of the role itself.” A later Department of Foreign Affairs review found that Ireland’s special envoys should be appointed in an “open, accountable and transparent manner”. A statement announcing Ms Zappone’s Seanad candidacy said her work as minister for children “saw the delivery of key reforms in early childhood education, gender equality, reproductive healthcare and social policy”. It also said “her leadership was instrumental in Ireland’s historic Marriage Equality referendum in May 2015”. She asked her wife, Ann Louise Gilligan, to remarry her in Ireland on the day the referendum passed. The couple had previously married in Canada. Ms Gilligan died in 2017. The statement also said: “In returning to the Seanad, Katherine aims to leverage her extensive experience to tackle today’s pressing challenges, including securing the future of higher education and research, lifting all children in Ireland out of poverty, protecting democracy, and defending LGBTQI+ rights.” Ms Zappone said: “As we navigate an era of extraordinary social and environmental change, I am committed to advancing inclusive policies that uphold our shared values and build a promising future for all.” She added: “We need to cultivate a kinder, inclusive society where engagement and dialogue drive our greatest leaps forward.” The current University of Dublin Senators are Tom Clonan and Lynn Ruane. David Norris retired in January 2024. Sixteen candidates have been nominated to contest the upcoming University of Dublin Seanad election.

2024/12/7,"‘A dedicated public representative’: Tributes paid to former Fine Gael TD Andrew Boylan Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan from 1987 to 2002 was a regular contributor to Dáil debates The Taoiseach has paid tribute to former Fine Gael TD Andrew Boylan, who has died aged 85. Mr Boylan represented the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in the Dáil from 1987 until 2002, when he lost his seat. He also served as a councillor and chairman of Cavan County Council and Cavan Urban Council. A farmer from Butlersbridge, Mr Boylan is survived by his wife Margot and children Gerard, Andrew, Matt, Fergal and Brìd. A regular contributor to debates during his time in the Oireachtas, he spoke on national issues and those closer to his constituency, including putting a focus on the lack of a “peace dividend” for Border counties. He once described the handling of the health service as being “like a man putting four new tyres on a car when the engine is banjaxed and needs a complete overhaul. That is what the health service needs. It is like an old car that works on a stop-and-go basis.” Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Simon Harris said: “Andrew was a dedicated public representative whose political career began when he was first elected to Cavan County Council in 1974. “Known for his advocacy, he was successful in bringing proper infrastructure to his constituency, and in delivering quality roads to the region. “He briefly held the equality and disabilities portfolio and consistently used the Order of Business to highlight disability as an issue.” Mr Harris said he wished to extend his sympathies to the Boylan family “at this very difficult time”.

2024/12/9,"Leo Varadkar says many in politics do not understand numbers or percentages Former taoiseach urges doctors not to ‘sell themselves short’ in pay negotiations with the government  People would be amazed at the number of those involved in policymaking who do not understand things like percentages, former taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. He said while some like Paschal Donohoe and Jack Chambers – the Ministers for Public Expenditure and the Minister for Finance – understand numbers, “quite a lot don’t”. He said generally speaking those who did well in professions such as politics and journalism did so because they were good at language and English and not at numbers and maths. Delivering the Irish Medical Organisation’s (IMO) annual Doolin memorial lecture in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland on Saturday, Mr Varadkar said: “I remember having a conversation with a former Cabinet member, who will remain nameless, and trying to explain house prices and the fact that if house prices fell by 50 per cent and then recovered by 100 per cent they actually were back to where they were at the start. “And blank face and blank stare – could not understand this for a second. And then of course percentages, medians and means are not well understood by a lot of people in the media system and the political system, which is a big worry, quite frankly.” Mr Varadkar urged doctors not to “sell themselves short” in pay negotiations with the government. “Doctors in Ireland are well paid but everyone in Ireland is actually well paid relative to other countries. Doctors in Ireland roughly earn three times the average income and that is not out of kilter with the rest of the developed world.” Mr Varadkar told members of the IMO: “As you enter into pay negotiations in the future, and people from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform say doctors in Ireland are among the best paid in the world, you can tell them civil servants are among the best paid in the world. It is a feature of Ireland that we are high paid and [have] a high cost of living. “There is no reason why you can’t defend your income and look for more in the years ahead, certainly in line with growth in wages in the private sector which is running at 4 per cent to 7 per cent per year. Don’t sell yourself short, would be my advice.” Mr Varadkar said pay for nurses did not compare well internationally. He said nurses’ pay at around €45,000 to €50,000 was not particularly high given that they had a four-year science degree and many had additional qualifications on top of this. He suggested the controversial new €2 billion national children’s hospital could be seen as a 10-year development project – running from 2016 when it secured planning permission to its projected commissioning in 2026. He indicated that an expenditure on average of €220 million year would represent about 20 per cent of the health service capital budget. The former taoiseach said he was worried that the pipeline of new hospital development projects being planned was not sufficiently strong. He suggested that in Galway a new €1 billion hospital was needed, with significant investment also required in Limerick and elsewhere. He said the planned new National Maternity Hospital project – to replace the existing facility in Holles Street – was “crawling along” and had not yet gone to tender for construction. The Department of Health subsequently contacted The Irish Times in response to Mr Varadkar’s comments to say the tender for the main works contractor for the development and relocation of the new National Maternity Hospital was issued earlier this year. Mr Varadkar said he hoped the new programme for government would include a commitment to open about 5,000 additional hospital beds, which was the level of investment he said was required. He forecast that the population in Ireland would reach six million by 2040 or so. He said at the heart of a lot of the problems in the Irish health system was that there were too few hospital beds. “We have done a terrible thing in policy terms – a lot done with advice from medics and specialists – by reducing hospital beds by far too much, and making the emergency department the only way through which most patients can get into the hospital. That is a fundamental thing that has not been resolved yet.” Mr Varadkar said in his defence as a former minister for health that he stopped the closure of hospital beds. He said over recent years governments had been increasing the bed stock “but not anywhere near what is required”.",0,1
2024/12/9,"Taoiseach briefed on changes to Roald Dahl book before appearing on Ryan Tubridy podcast Staff at Department of the Taoiseach prepared four-page primer, including notes on Roald Dahl’s Esio Trot at request of Simon Harris Taoiseach Simon Harris was given a briefing on how his favourite childhood book from Roald Dahl had been sanitised since he first read it as he prepared for an interview with Ryan Tubridy. Mr Harris agreed to be a guest on the Bookshelf podcast and was asked to pick three novels he loved, ideally “a childhood book, a book that made you cry [and] a book that changed your life”. Staff at the Department of the Taoiseach prepared a four-page primer, including notes on Roald Dahl’s Esio Trot at the specific request of Mr Harris. The briefing advised how the book would have changed from the version the Taoiseach read in childhood as it had “been edited in recent years alongside other Dahl works”. The briefing said: “In Esio Trot, more than a dozen changes were made, including removing [a] reference to Mrs Silver being ‘attractive’, changing ‘I’ll be your slave for life’ to ‘you’ll be my hero for life’ (and similar). “[A] reference to a woman changing her surname upon marriage [was also edited out].” The briefing said it was the last of Roald Dahl’s books to be published during his lifetime and unlike other works did not feature “tyrannical adults and heroic [or] magical children”. “[It] is the story of an ageing lonely man (Mr Hoppy), trying to make a connection with a person that he has loved from afar (Mrs Silver).” The document then went on to give a brief summary of the plot before advising about changes to the text since he read it. In a note, the Taoiseach was also told to be “as generic as possible” on the podcast when it came to talking about days and dates as it would not go live immediately. The briefing said: “For example, you are recording the podcast one week before you welcome the British prime minister to Ireland, but it will not be made available online until October 1st, three weeks after that meeting.” It said the format of the interview would be “conversational and relaxed” aiming to get the life story of the guest “through the lens of their favourite books.” “The podcast is not a test on books, Tubridy uses them to springboard into a phase of a guest’s life and then goes all over that period,” staff told Mr Harris. It said Esio Trot would represent his childhood and “reading by yourself” before a quick “segway” [sic] into the Taoiseach’s background. The next book chosen was Mark Haddon’s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time and its representation of an autistic child and how this opened up Mr Harris’ “early advocacy”. Two books were listed as life changing, Say Nothing by Patrick Radden Keefe and Lost Lives by David McKittrick, both about the conflict in Northern Ireland. The briefing said: “The thinking being the way the author [Radden Keefe] tells a story from the Troubles as a novel and as your life changed this year in becoming Taoiseach, a reminder of how far Ireland has come.” Say Nothing could then be linked to Lost Lives which the notes said was “an extraordinary piece of work but a deeply sobering reminder of the Troubles and the responsibility of being a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.”",0,1
2024/2/1,"Ireland seeking review of EU-Israel trade agreement and recognition of Palestine, Taoiseach says Discussion on conflict in Gaza among EU leaders at Brussels summit, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says Ireland is seeking the support of fellow EU member states for a review of the EU-Israel trade agreement and is also discussing whether a group of countries could jointly recognise Palestine, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar was speaking at the conclusion of the EU summit in Brussels, where there was discussion among leaders, but no agreed conclusions, on the conflict in Gaza. “We’re having discussions about different things that we could do,” Mr Varadkar said. “ICJ [the International Court of Justice case taken by South Africa alleging genocide against Israel] is one of those. Much higher up the list would be a review of the EU-Israel agreement. “EU-Israel relations are founded on an agreement which has a human rights clause and a lot of us believe that Israel may be in breach of that, and that’s something we’re talking about,” he said. “Another thing we’re talking about is the possibility of recognition – that a number of EU states acting together, to recognise Palestine could enable a more equal negotiation to happen after the war has ended in Gaza ... “ICJ is on the agenda, and I know that gets a huge amount of focus in Ireland. To be honest, there’s nobody here among the 27 member states that believes that a court case that will be decided in three or four years’ time is going to save any Palestinian lives or prevent any Palestinians being injured. There’s other actions that we need to take,” Mr Varadkar told reporters at the summit venue this afternoon. Mr Varadkar also said that he had spoken out against any possible suspension of EU funding to the UN refugee agency in Gaza, UNWRA. Several countries, including the US and Germany, have stopped funding the agency over allegations that some UNWRA staff were involved in the Hamas attacks against Israel on October 7th. The UN is investigating the charges. “While we are appalled at the idea and the allegations that agency staff were involved in a beastly terrorist attack against Israel on October 7th, that in itself doesn’t justify the suspension of funding from UNWRA, either from Ireland or from the European Union,” Mr Varadkar said. However, he said that the European Commission was reviewing its funding, and acknowledged that payments due this month to the refugee agency were not certain to be delivered. “The Commission President made it very clear that the next payment is due in February and that that payment may well be made – that there’s no freeze on EU funding. But they will want assurances from the UN that everything is being done to make sure that if there were any UN agency staff that they are dealt with,” he said. Asked if future EU payments were no in doubt, Mr Varadkar said: “The position is that the EU is not suspending its funding for UNWRA, but it is reviewing it. And that decision will be made between now and the end of February. But I’d be confident that the decision will be made to continue that funding.” EU leaders did not seek to have agreed written conclusions, because of divisions over Gaza, but discussed the issue at length, the Taoiseach said. He added that Ireland needed to understand that other EU countries – he cited Germany and Austria – see questions relating to Israel in a different way owing to their history. Other countries who he said had seen attacks from Islamist allies of Hamas also have a different perspective, he said. “We just need to be understanding of that,” he added.",0,1
2024/2/1,"Northern Ireland Assembly set for return as MPs vote today on UK-DUP deal Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says there will be ‘questions’ about the deal and its effect on trading arrangements but that as things stand there are no major ‘red flags’ The British measures which secured the Democratic Unionist Party’s return to powersharing are expected to become law today, paving the way for the imminent restoration of Northern Ireland’s political institutions. MPs will vote on two pieces of legislation following a debate in the House of Commons, but this is a formality as it has the support of both the British government and its official opposition. The outgoing speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Alex Maskey, wrote to MLAs on Wednesday to inform them preparations were being made to enable a sitting to take place at short notice. “In January 2020, the Assembly was summoned within 24 hours and a similar timeframe may be necessary on this occasion,” he wrote. Saturday is believed to be the most likely day for an Assembly recall, when the first order of business will be to nominate a speaker and fill the first and deputy first minister roles. Michelle O’Neill will become the first nationalist to hold the position of first minister, while the Lagan Valley MLA Emma Little-Pengelly is tipped as the front-runner for the role of deputy first minister, given that the DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said he intends to remain as an MP until the general election. The command paper aimed at addressing the concerns which led to the DUP’s two-year boycott of the Northern Executive and Assembly was published on Wednesday. The 80-page document, Safeguarding the Union, was aimed at reassuring unionists about Northern Ireland’s integral place in the UK. It removes routine checks on goods going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and replaces the so-called green lane with a UK internal market lane. It also ends dynamic alignment with European Union law and introduces a legal requirement for new legislation to be “assessed as to whether it impacts on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”. The UK government also committed to “remove the legal duties to have regard to the ‘all-island economy’” though it is not clear what this will mean in practice. The British foreign secretary, David Cameron, outlined the package in a call to the European Commission vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, on Wednesday morning. Mr Sefcovic said the commission would “analyse carefully the texts published today”. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said there would be “questions” about the deal and its effect on trading arrangements but that as things stood there were no big “red flags”. Downing Street has characterised the measures as “operational” changes to the Windsor Framework which, while “significant”, did not alter the “fundamentals” and would not require specific EU approval. The DUP leader gave a number of media interviews on Wednesday as he attempted to sell the deal to his party, saying the DUP had achieved “clear” alterations to the Windsor Framework and repeatedly challenging “naysayers” to outline their own achievements. In a joint press conference alongside the Northern Secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, Mr Donaldson said his critics had achieved “a big blank sheet of nothing” whereas he could “demonstrate very clearly what we have delivered, and it’s there for everyone to read”. He denied there was division in his party over the decision to return to powersharing, saying “I don’t accept the characterisation that my party is split” and the vote at Monday’s meeting of the party executive was “absolutely decisive.” In the House of Commons, the DUP MP Sammy Wilson – one of the party’s hardliners – criticised not the party leader but the “spineless, weak-kneed, Brexit-betraying government,” indicating his tacit acceptance of the deal, while other senior figures, including the East Derry MP Gregory Campbell, said they supported it.",0,1
2024/2/1,"EU-Latin America trade deal cannot be approved in current form, says Varadkar Mercosur supporters had hoped for agreement with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay on deal after new environmental protections sought The Mercosur trade deal between the European Union and Latin American countries could not be approved in its current form, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told reporters on arrival at a summit of leaders besieged by farmers’ protests. The deal has been in negotiations for two decades, and supporters had hoped the agreement with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay could be concluded after new environmental protections were sought. On Thursday, however, the Taoiseach ruled out ratifying the deal in its current form, following similar remarks earlier this week by French president Emmanuel Macron. “I also would echo president Macron’s comments in relation to Mercosur. This trade agreement can’t be ratified in its current form,” Mr Varadkar told reporters. “We can’t have a situation whereby we impose environmental regulations for farmers, and allow imports from countries that don’t have those same regulations.” France has been hard-hit by farmers’ demonstrations in recent weeks, which have blocked roads and attempted to impose a “siege” on Paris with their tractors in protest at environmental rules, increasing costs and competition from cheaper imports. Protests blocked roads around Brussels ahead of the leaders’ meeting on Thursday, causing widespread disruption as the summit began. Similar protests have taken place in Germany, Romania, the Netherlands and Poland. The protesters appear to have been undeterred by an announcement by the European Commission on the eve of the summit proposing to suspend plans requiring farmers to leave 4 per cent of their land fallow to get EU subsidies, a measure intended to help halt a collapse in biodiversity. Mr Varadkar told reporters he understood “the pressures that our farmers are under, whether it’s increased energy costs, fertiliser costs and new environmental regulations”. “I think the priority for us should be implementing existing rules and regulations, not imposing new additional ones for farmers for the next couple of years,” he said. Mr Varadkar’s intervention on the stalled trade deal between the EU and the Mercosur countries comes after the European Commission insisted the deal was still alive but will assist French president Emmanuel Macron’s efforts to send the agreement back to the drawing board. The deal was first agreed in 2019 after two decades of on-again, off-again negotiations but the EU has been seeking additional environmental safeguards in recent talks. The deal is fiercely opposed by many European farming organisations as they fear it will expose them to low-cost competition from countries where they say environmental rules are much looser. President Macron, who is under pressure from French farmers, recently said the deal was dead, but the commission insisted that talks were ongoing. Mr Varadkar’s intervention on Thursday will tip the scales Mr Macron’s way, as trade deals need to be ratified by all member states. Irish Government sources said there were also difficulties on the Mercosur side, with Argentina and Paraguay also raising objections Speaking after the summit, Mr Macron said he was not against a trade deal with Latin American countries in principle but he believes the Mercosur deal, which is years in the making, is now past its sell by date. “I don’t think we can ask European producers to accept a forced market to respect more rules, and at the same time continue to negotiate free-trade agreements as we did in the 1980s,” he told reporters. The French president, along with Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and other EU leaders met farmers’ representatives after the summit. “We listen to European farmers,” Ms von der Leyen said.",0,1
2024/2/10,"Arson attacks: The work of organised extremists or local ‘lone wolves’? There have been at least 23 arson attacks with a suspected anti-immigration motivation since 2018. Their frequency has escalated in the last three months Plainclothes gardaí watched discreetly from the sidelines on Monday as hundreds of anti-immigration protesters gathered outside the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin city centre and prepared to march to the Custom House. These detectives were not looking out for public order breaches or potential clashes with the antiracism counter demonstrators further up O’Connell Street – that was the job of the hundreds of public order and uniformed gardaí deployed to the protest. Instead, they were searching for far-right activists involved in recent criminality, including the Dublin riots of November 23rd last and attacks on asylum seeker accommodation centres in the capital. In some cases, they knew the names of the people they were searching for. In others, they just had CCTV images which they hoped they might match to a face at the protest. It was a good idea. Sources say a flurry of arrests and search operations targeting  far-right activists this week was in part enabled by Monday’s intelligence-gathering operation. Over the course of the week, one man was arrested on suspicion of setting a Luas on fire during the riots. A short time later, another man was detained for allegedly causing criminal damage to a direct provision centre in Kerry last month. On Thursday, two men and a woman were arrested for allegedly setting fire to a former pub in Ringsend, Dublin 4 that had been falsely rumoured to be earmarked for asylum seeker accommodation. The attack gutted the old Shipwright pub on Thorncastle Street, preventing it from being used as intended: as temporary accommodation for homeless families. It brings to 10 the number of people arrested for anti-immigration arson attacks in recent months. This figure does not include those arrested following the Dublin riots, during which several accommodation centres for asylum seekers were targeted. After months of what appeared to the public to be Garda inaction, it appeared the force was finally cracking down on violent far-right extremists. Still, the attacks continue. In the early hours of Wednesday this week, a seven-bed bungalow in Leixlip, Co Kildare was destroyed by arsonists after false rumours spread it was to be used as asylum seeker housing. Three days previously, a disused nursing home in Crooksling, near Saggart in southwest Co Dublin, was set alight. It was one of a number of HSE locations being preliminarily assessed by the Department of Integration for possible use for refugees or asylum seekers. The latest incidents bring the number of arson attacks with a suspected anti-immigration motivation to 23 since 2018. In the last year alone there have been 13 attacks, with most occurring in the last three months. The question on the minds of politicians, gardaí and the public is, who is behind these attacks? Is it a centrally organised far-right group, a loose network of anti-immigrant activists or just individual local criminals incited by online misinformation and racist rhetoric? Tánaiste Micheál Martin raised some eyebrows on Wednesday when, in response to the Leixlip incident, he said there was “clearly an organised campaign” of arson taking place. Since then, gardaí have repeated their long-held opinion that most, if not all, of the arson attacks to date have been carried out by local people, without outside direction. “I think people find it a bit comforting to think this is all being done by one overarching group who are travelling around the country. People don’t want to believe there are individuals in every community more than capable of doing this,” said one garda. The results from the various Garda investigations to date tend to back up the “lone wolf” theory. There are no discernible patterns to the attacks, except that they  have almost always occurred following rumours a location was to be used as accommodation for either asylum seekers or refugees from Ukraine. The attacks take place on different days of the week and at different times, although usually during the hours of darkness for obvious reasons. There  has been a wide variety in the methods used to set properties on fire. In some cases, windows  have been broken and burning material dropped inside. In others, petrol bombs  have been thrown at the property. The most recent blaze, in Leixlip, was caused by the arsonists bringing fire logs and coal into the building and setting them  alight. “Some attacks are quite professional, with the fire set in a way so as to cause as much damage as possible,” said a garda. “Others are very amateur. That’s why there have been so many failed incidents.” All those arrested so far are from the area local to where the attack was carried out, gardaí say, although some have connections to wider far-right groups. The fact that the attacks seem to be the work of local, often bumbling, individuals is a source of further concern for gardaí –  this factor makes it more likely an occupied premises will be targeted inadvertently, leading to serious injury or death. No one has been seriously injured in the attacks so far but there have been several close calls. In November 2018, the owner of the Caiseal Mara Hotel in Moville, Co Donegal was injured in an arson attack on the building, which  had been earmarked to accommodate asylum seekers. On the night of the Dublin riots last November, a warehouse in Finglas in northwest Dublin previously earmarked for asylum seekers was set ablaze. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus had to rescue a security guard from the building. In Buncrana, Co Donegal, arsonists tried to set the Sailor’s Rest accommodation centre on fire using a firework while it was occupied by about 50 people. Gardaí fear these lone-wolf arsonists are becoming more brazen. The former nursing home in Crooksling was burned down despite the presence of a security guard at the property. Gardaí were conducting regular patrols past the Leixlip property around the time it was set alight, and the owner had taken several security precautions after being warned it may be targeted. In several cases, including at Leixlip and a hotel in Rooskey on the Leitrim-Roscommon border, arsonists  returned a second time after failing to burn the property down at the first attempt. Support for the lone-wolf theory can be found in other European countries.  Irish arsonists are in fact repeating what has been going on in the rest of the EU since 2015, according to Claudia Wallner, a terrorism expert and research fellow with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). “In terms of the arson cases, we have seen many, many attacks like this in Germany, Austria, Sweden and in places in southern Europe, where a lot of the refugees initially arrived,” she said. As in Ireland, there is a direct correlation in other EU countries with large numbers of asylum seekers or refugees arriving and an increase in far-right violence, she said. Many of these attacks do not receive much international attention because they usually target unoccupied buildings and therefore fall below the definition of terrorism. Burning  buildings earmarked for migrant housing is a popular tactic among anti-immigration extremists as it is in line with the image they want to present as “defenders of Europe rather than aggressors”, said Wallner. Crucially, she says, far-right violence is typically carried out by individuals rather than organised hierarchical groups. These individuals might be loosely networked through the internet. The more organised far-right groups are smart enough not to become directly involved in violence. The nature of arson attacks, which usually occur in the middle of the night with no witnesses, makes it difficult to say with certainty who is behind them, says Prof Tore Bjorgo, an expert on the extreme right at the University of Oslo in Norway. However, in general, organised far-right groups have become less violent in recent years, with a greater proportion of attacks coming from lone actors, he says. “Organisations know they are under quite strict surveillance and they know they will be arrested and banned. I have seen this very clearly with the Nordic Resistance movement, which is the main neo-Nazi group here.” The “general European pattern” is that attacks are carried out by individuals acting alone, he says. Bjorgo is the director of the Centre for Extremism Research: Right-Wing Extremism, Hate Crime and Political Violence (C-Rex) which publishes a yearly report on right-wing terrorism in Europe. In most previous years, Ireland has barely featured in the report. Data from 2023 is still being collated, but at least six incidents which occurred  in Ireland last year will likely meet the centre’s definition of far-right terrorism and be included in the next report. Gardaí hope the latest round of arrests will deter other potential arsonists. They are also confident of more arrests. Officers have been scouring social media, particularly TikTok and Telegram, for posts documenting arson attacks which were uploaded suspiciously soon after the fires broke out. They are analysing metadata from these posts to determine their times and locations. Meanwhile, the cycle continues. In Arklow, Co Wicklow, where the former Eir depot building in Croghan Industrial Estate is being assessed as a potential location to house Ukrainian refugees, protests have been ongoing throughout the week and multiple threats have appeared online. “We will succeed. No building in Arklow will be filled with men,” wrote one person. “Hopefully no building will have to be set on fire, but that’s what will happen if the Government doesn’t listen to us and stop bringing them in.”",0,1
2024/2/10,"The Healy-Raes of Kerry and their multimillion-euro business empire The politician brothers have substantial business interests in their home county and multiple business connections with State bodies, including Kerry County Council Kerry TDs Michael and Danny Healy-Rae are very wealthy businessmen as well as successful politicians; Michael owns a substantial property portfolio, his brother Danny a profitable plant hire business. Both are millionaires who have business dealings with the State and employ family members as parliamentary assistants and secretaries in Leinster House. Two of Danny Healy-Rae’s children, Maura and Johnny, and one of Michael Healy-Rae’s children, Jackie jnr, are Independent councillors on Kerry County Council, which in turn has business dealings with Healy-Rae family companies. All of the firms are based in the village of Kilgarvan, Co Kerry, a 10-minute drive from Kenmare and the centre of the family’s interests. Danny Healy-Rae’s company, Healy-Rae Plant Hire Ltd, incorporated in 1999, reported an after-tax profit of €1.12 million in 2022, up from €1 million the previous year. The company paid no dividend, according to its latest abridged, unaudited accounts and finished the year with accumulated profits of €4.7 million. It had no employees other than the directors, Healy-Rae and his son, Johnny, who received directors’ emoluments of €38,000 between them. The company’s largest creditor at year’s end were “group undertakings” owed €915,099. The undertakings are not identified. Bank and lease debt was substantially less than this amount. According to Healy-Rae’s most recent declaration of interests to the Dáil, the company’s clients include Kerry County Council and Irish Water. According to Johnny Healy Rae’s latest declaration of interests to Kerry County Council, the company also does work for Cork County Council. The company has an interest in a quarry at Rossacroo, Kilgarvan, according to its accounts, and owns a subsidiary, Sunville Construction Ltd, which produced an after-tax profit of €109,703 in 2022. The 2021 accounts for Sunville show it made an after-tax profit of €198,000 that year and owed €1.85 million to unidentified group undertakings. It employed an average of 27 people and paid directors’ remuneration of €75,733 to its two directors, Danny and Johnny. As well as being a TD and plant hire operator, Danny Healy-Rae describes himself in his Dáil declaration of interests as a publican (he has a pub in Kilgarvan), farmer and operator of a bus hire business (which does business with Bus Éireann). The declaration lists three plots of land totalling 37 hectares (91 acres), which Land Registry records indicate have no mortgages. Michael Healy-Rae describes himself in his 2022 Dáil declaration as a public representative, postmaster, farmer, shop-owner and operator of a plant hire business. His declaration of property interests lists 24 properties, an increase on the 18 he declared in 2017. Most of the properties are houses and apartments that are rented out. Included in the recent additions to his property portfolio is Rosemont guest house in Oakpark, Tralee, which houses refugees from Ukraine. The State paid €658,770 for the use of the guest house in the year to the end of September last. Land Registry filings indicate that Healy-Rae bought the property in 2020, with a mortgage from AIB. Most of the properties listed in Healy-Rae’s declaration of interests are houses or apartments in Kilgarvan or the wider Co Kerry area. He also declared 40 hectares (100 acres) of land in Kilgarvan used for farming and forestry. Searches in the Land Registry show recent property purchases for which no mortgage was registered. The properties include a small house at the back of his petrol station in Kilgarvan, which was bought for €85,000 in December 2021, according to the Residential Property Price register. One of his companies, Black Cap & Co Ltd, was incorporated in 2017 and recorded a loss of almost €100,000 in the year to the end of April 2022, according to its latest abridged, unaudited accounts. The directors, Healy-Rae and his wife, Eileen Healy-Rae, were paid directors’ emoluments of €47,000. The company, which is involved in the retail sale of petrol and groceries, paid €12,000 in rent to Michael Healy-Rae, who owns the company’s premises in Kilgarvan. According to Healy-Rae’s declaration of interests to the Dáil, the company was involved in the supply of diesel to Kerry County Council. Healy-Rae is also the owner of ML Healy Rae Properties Ltd, a property maintenance company incorporated in December 2020 that produced an after-tax profit of €31,729 in 2022.

2024/2/12,"Israeli assault on Rafah puts more than a million civilians at ‘grave risk’, Varadkar warns Martin asserts Irish support for UNRWA as only option to provide education and health services as well as humanitarian supplies Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he is “extremely concerned” at the prospect of an Israeli ground offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza, with many Palestinians now sheltering there “at grave risk”. Israeli early on Monday launched air strikes in support of a special forces operation that freed two hostages in the area near the Egyptian border where many Palestinians have taken refuge after months of conflict. International voices including US president Joe Biden and aid agencies have cautioned against an expected ground assault on Rafah given the high risk to the civilian population now concentrated there. Mr Varadkar urged an immediate “sustained humanitarian ceasefire” in place of the expected offensive. “There are more than a million and a half Palestinians taking refuge there, having been told that it would be safe,” he said. “There is nowhere else they can credibly go. “In such a densely populated area, a military operation will put them at very grave risk. Israel needs to listen to the many concerned voices from around the world and to step back. “There urgently needs to be a sustained humanitarian ceasefire to allow humanitarian access, and to allow hostages to be released,” Mr Varadkar said. Tánaiste Micheál Martin has indicated that Ireland remains strongly supportive of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) because it gets vital aid and supplies to Gaza and Palestinians more generally in the North and West Bank. Israel has claimed it discovered a tunnel network running partly beneath the body’s headquarters, describing it as proof that Hamas is exploiting the agency. Some countries suspended funding for the UNRWA after previous Israeli allegations, including that staff at the agency doubled as Hamas operatives. Speaking in Cork the Tánaiste described UNRWA as being “absolutely essential”.  “There are 30,000 employees in UNRWA across all the region - 13,000 in Gaza alone. In respect of education and health services and food and vital humanitarian supplies there is no option actually but to continue supporting UNRWA. “I will be meeting with Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, this week. We did issue a very quick statement in the aftermath of what transpired to underpin the centrality of UNRWA to the population in Gaza and that is the bottom line really.” Mr Martin said he understands the importance of UNRWA. “Anybody I speak to understands that and gets that. We are appealing to people to make sure that they do not suspend aid.” He said that Mr Lazzarini has taken “very important steps” in respect of dealing with those against whom allegations have been made. “Also in facilitating an independent review outside of the United Nations jurisdiction into the organisation - there were attempts last year to undermine UNRWA in respect of school textbooks. “A German institute was brought in by the European Union to examine that and they came back and said that the schools run by UNRWA in Gaza were run according to UNESCO standards.” “There were ongoing efforts over the years to undermine UNRWA and in my view, having been to Gaza in the past and having been to Jordan and the West Bank, one cannot replace UNRWA with one click of the fingers in respect of the scale and the enormity of the humanitarian crisis.” “I am very clear about that - it will be interesting to meet with UNRWA later this week to review the situation. Many people across Europe and the world know the reality of the situation.” Mr Martin also stressed that Ireland is extremely concerned at the humanitarian devastation which could occur if the Israeli armed forces conduct a ground offensive in Rafah. “I issued a very strong statement on Saturday in relation to this - I am in no doubt but that a continued bombardment of Rafah will constitute a war crime. “It will gravely violate international humanitarian law. We are looking now at what is the largest refugee camp in the world - 1.5 million people in Rafah alone - they cannot be displaced safely. “To bomb and to mount a military operation in such a confined area with so many people is absolutely inhumane and unacceptable. “The international community must do everything it possibly can to put the pressure on Israel not to proceed with this. It is very, very serious - it will create catastrophic conditions on top of what already are dire situations for civilians in Gaza. “It is unacceptable what is happening and we have to do what we can which we will through the various forums we are members of, particularly the European Union and the United Nations. Working with the Arab nations as well and making it very clear to Israel that we view this as a violation of international humanitarian law.”",0,1
2024/2/12,"Fine Gael TD Paul Kehoe confirms he will not contest next general election Wexford TD is the latest in a string of party’s politicians to announce their impending departures in recent months Former Fine Gael junior minister Paul Kehoe has announced that he will not be contesting the next general election saying it has been “a very difficult decision” but “now is the right time for me and my family.” Mr Kehoe was first elected to the Dáil in the 2002 general election and has served as a TD for Wexford for more than two decades. He informed his local party organisation of his decision on Monday night. He spent almost 10 years at the Cabinet table both as government chief whip and Minister of State for Defence. In an address thanking his local supporters he said: “Wexford Fine Gael organisation put their faith in me ... and I hope that I have repaid that faith over the past 22 years ... I have worked tirelessly for my constituents helping thousands of people, businesses and organisations throughout County Wexford and am grateful to my staff who have worked with me through the years in doing so.” He said he knows Wexford “is in a better place than when I was first elected”, that there is “always more to do but progress in the last two decades has been immense with many more exciting plans ahead.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar paid tribute to Mr Kehoe saying the “pivotal role” role he played as former taoiseach Enda Kenny’s chief whip for 12 years in government and opposition “is underestimated and known only to his closest colleagues. He maintained cohesion and discipline while always being sensitive to people’s personal problems and concerns”. “I was honoured to reappoint him to Cabinet in 2017 as Minister with Responsibility for Defence”. Mr Varadkar said: “I wish Paul the very best in whatever he decides to do next. He is a man not to be underestimated, is a good judge of character and understands how politics is done.” As a result of the Electoral Commission’s boundary review Wexford will be split in the next election across two constituencies: Wexford and Wicklow-Wexford. Mr Varadkar said: “Fine Gael will aim to win a seat in each constituency representing a net gain for the party.” Mr Kehoe is the latest in a string of Fine Gael politicians to announce their impending departure in recent months. Other veteran politicians who will be stepping down include Fergus O’Dowd, Frances Fitzgerald, Deirdre Clune, Richard Bruton, Charlie Flanagan, David Stanton. A group of younger TDs including Joe McHugh, John Paul Phelan and Brendan Griffin have also decided to leave politics.",0,1
2024/2/12,"Varadkar downplays fears of referendums’ impact on immigration law Taoiseach says issues on ballot ‘more complicated’ than other previous votes such as repealing the 8th or marriage equality Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has sought to downplay fears about the impact on immigration law of two upcoming constitutional referendums, warning of “red herrings” in the run into the votes on March 8th. Speaking at the launch of the Fine Gael campaign calling for a dual Yes vote in referendums on family and care to be held on March 8th, Mr Vardakar accepted that the issues were “more complicated” than what he said were more straightforward choices on repealing the 8th Amendment or marriage equality. Mr Varadkar defended the use of the term “durable relationship” in the proposed wording on a constitutional amendment on the family, which would extend recognition to families other than those based on marriage. Some No vote proponents have argued that the broadened definition could provide a wider basis for refugees seeking to bring family members here under rules that allow for the reunification of families. The Taoiseach said that while people could make this case, family law would not “override” all other policies, pointing out that under current immigration law, there were circumstances where the foreign national spouse of an Irish person could be deported. “There are going to be red herrings, and there are going to be people who try to make the referendum about something that it is not actually about,” he said, outlining that the Maastricht and Lisbon Treaty campaigns had seen opponents make claims about conscription to a European army. Opponents of the referendum have argued the term “durable relationship” is imprecise and could invite unintended consequences. Mr Varadkar said there were a million people in families which are not based on marriage, such as those led by cohabiting parents, lone parents or grandparents. He said the term could be further defined by law by the Oireachtas and interpreted by the courts. “Some people are giving the impression that every durable relationship therefore becomes a family. That’s not the case. Lots of people have all sorts of job relationships, business relationships, for example, that might be going on for decades.” “Nobody is going to be able to rock down to the courts and say that makes them a family,” he said, arguing there are other tests in the Constitution which define what is a family and would therefore limit the relationships which could be deemed as familial. This includes a requirement that a family must be the “natural and fundamental unit group of society” and that it must be a “moral institution”. He said the Constitution needed to “catch up” with already existing legislation on tax and social welfare, which recognises one parent families. The Taoiseach said the referendum on care, if passed, would put “an additional and stronger obligation” on future governments than currently exists. He said any future Government that tried to “roll back” on policies to support carers would be challenged in the courts. Mr Varadkar said that the changes would apply to both carers and those who receive care, which, he said, was “much more inclusive” and more meaningful “because it puts an obligation on the State to strive to support that care”. The Taoiseach said the Government had considered extending the constitutional recognition of care giving beyond the family unit, but that it had decided not to, as care outside families tends to be given on a commercial basis. “We thought there would be real difficulties in extending those kind of constitutional rights to a corporation ... And also when it came to a particular type of employee” – such as a care worker, whose relationship with the person being cared for would then have a constitutional protection that would not be available to a Garda or a nurse. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin has decided it will be supporting a ‘Yes-Yes’ vote in next month’s referendums following a meeting of its Ard Comhairle on Monday night though a source said the party believes there is “much more” that must be done to support carers and families.",0,1
2024/2/12,"Michael Fitzmaurice becomes third TD to join ‘Independent Ireland’ party New grouping with Michael Collins and Richard O’Donoghue offers ‘common sense’ to voters, Fitzmaurice says Roscommon-Galway Independent TD Michael Fitzmaurice has joined the newly formed political party, Independent Ireland. Mr Fitzmaurice will team up with Independent TDs Michael Collins and Richard O’Donoghue, who announced the establishment of the party last November. Mr Fitzmaurice said he spent the last 12 months weighing up the political landscape and that he was either going to “set up a party or leave politics”. “Michael and Richard then announced their new party. After extensive negotiations with them, Independent Ireland operatives and consultation with my core team of supporters, I decided that it was best to join forces with Michael and Richard to build something substantial together,” Mr Fitzmaurice said in a statement on Monday. “Too often independents and new parties fragment into increasingly narrow camps when what is needed is unity, dialogue and occasionally compromise. “I didn’t want to see that happen here. I believe it is better for voters to have a clear, unambiguous choice at election time. I believe that Independent Ireland can be that choice. We are the party of common sense solutions for this and future generations.” Mr Collins, leader of Independent Ireland and TD for Cork South-West, said Mr Fitzmaurice’s “integrity and knowledge”, combined with his experience in national politics made him a “fantastic addition” to the party. Mr O’Donoghue, TD for Limerick, said the party was established to build “a coalition of people and politicians who genuinely want to address the real world issues facing ordinary people across this nation”. “When it comes to building a party rooted in common sense with the goal of improving the lives of the people of Ireland, I don’t think we could have looked for a better partner than Michael Fitz,” he said. “His dedication, drive and determination comes second only to his common-sense approach to policy and priorities. We have a job of work ahead of ourselves over the coming months and years to build a party not just for the next election but for future generations, but it is a job that we are happy to take on, and we are confident we can deliver for the people of Ireland.”",0,1
2024/2/13,"Sinn Féin offers amnesty to licence fee non-payers as it pitches direct funding for RTÉ Amnesty a ‘slap in the face’ to those who pay, Varadkar says, criticising ‘populist’ plan Sinn Féin TD Thomas Gould has said that an amnesty could be introduced for people who have not paid for the TV licence, mirroring the amnesty offered to those who didn’t pay water charges. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, Mr Gould pointed out that last year 13,000 people went through the courts for TV licence evasion. The cost was “just over €2 million”, he said, which was the same amount RTÉ lost on Toy Show The Musical. “So what we have is ordinary people being dragged through the courts, facing a thousand-euro fine, short-term imprisonment and a charge against on them, while at the same time, executives at RTÉ are squandering millions with no accountability,” he said. Mr Gould denied that Sinn Féin was encouraging people not to pay their TV licence. “I’m saying at this moment in time, the licence fee is a legal requirement. We’re telling people to make sure to pay the licence fee, as long as it’s a legal requirement.” The amnesty for those who have not paid their TV licence was just one of a number of measures the party was proposing, he added. “In 2017, the Government gave an amnesty for people who didn’t pay the water charges. So look, this has been done before,” he said. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said Sinn Féin plans for an amnesty would be a “slap in the face” for those who had paid up. Mr Varadkar said he “profoundly” disagreed with the measure, which is contained in a Sinn Féin private members motion on the future funding of RTÉ due to be debated in the Dáil this evening. “I really think this is desperation from Sinn Féin, and a reversion to left populism which I suppose worked for them in the past and maybe they think it will work for them again.” “I actually think for a lot of law abiding decent people who pay their bills, who pay the TV licence, they’d be quite annoyed actually at the thought that people who don’t pay their way, don’t obey the law would somehow get an amnesty from Sinn Féin,” he said to reporters on his way into Tuesday’s cabinet meeting. He argued that the solution to controversies in RTÉ was not people refusing to pay their TV licence, which he said would harm ordinary workers at the broadcaster and damage public service broadcasting. The government will put down a counter motion to the Sinn Féin proposal, which mandates the government to scrap the licence fee immediately and introduce a platform-neutral media fund to support public service media content production. Meanwhile Minister for Finance Michael McGrath labelled Sinn Féin’s motion as “an act of irresponsible politics”. “They are reacting to events. Last year when they brought forward their budget plans for 2024 they made no provision for such abolition and therefore their budgetary approach lacks credibility and it does augur well if that is going to be their approach if they are elected to government in the future,” he told reporters on Tuesday. Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe said: “If Sinn Féin are making for the case for change to the country, is this what they are offering? If it is, what are they going to say to everybody else who has been paying taxes and charges fairly over the last few years, are they going to get an amnesty too? “Sinn Féin on the one hand are making extraordinary spending commitments, on the other hand they’re continuing their approach, saying these are the taxes they want to reduce, these are the taxes they want to eliminate,” he said. “This wasn’t included in the Sinn Féin alternative budget. They are saying that they want to pay for it out of exchequer funding but they’re not saying how, they’re not saying where the money will come from, and they’re not saying what other taxes they will change,” he said Under a model proposed by Sinn Féin RTÉ would be funded under a dual system with direct exchequer funding along with commercial funding through advertising. “Our new model will ensure that public sector broadcasting going into the future will be on a much better, sustainable footing,” Mr Gould told Morning Ireland. “What we are proposing in our Bill today is a triple lock, and that will ensure independence. And what we mean by that is we would have Coimisiún na Meán on that. They would outline and review the amount of funding that would be needed, that would be sustainable over a four-year period, so that it couldn’t be interfered by ministers. “And if a minister tried to interfere, they would have to come before the Dáil to explain why.” Mr Gould said that the Taoiseach was being hypocritical about the TV licence because he had been prepared to abolish water charges and there had been an amnesty. “So is he saying there’s one rule for the water charges and then the other one, if we abolish the TV licence.” Cabinet is also set to consider a plan to introduce child benefit for 18-year-olds in full time education earlier than initially outlined. Under the proposal, the benefit would be paid to those eligible from May, rather than September, as was initially outlined when the policy was introduced on budget day. Ministers will also discuss the HSE’s National Service Plan, which is expected to mandate a €250 million reduction in spending on agency staff in the health service, while Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe will seek formal cabinet support for the public pay deal struck with unions last month. The cabinet will also discuss plans for a special Oireachtas committee to examine the report of the Citizen’s Assembly on drug use.",0,1
2024/2/14,"Israel blinded by rage says Varadkar, as Government hardens stance on Gaza Criticism of ‘rogue state’ comes amid fears it is about to attack city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinian refugees have taken shelter There has been a hardening of the Irish Government’s criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar saying it has become “blinded by rage” and Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney suggesting it is “behaving like a rogue state”. The rhetoric from Dublin comes amid fears that Israel will invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million war refugees are holed up in temporary shelters. Egyptian officials reported some progress in talks held in Cairo on Tuesday in an effort to reach a ceasefire and a release of some of the 134 hostages captured during the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th, but a breakthrough is still not imminent. Senior officials from the US, Israel, Egypt and Qatar met after Egypt reportedly warned Hamas that if there is no deal in the next few weeks, Israel will invade Rafah. United Nations secretary general António Guterres said he hopes talks will be successful and an Israeli offensive in Rafah can be avoided, warning that it would have “devastating consequences”. Speaking in the Dáil, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said there was a “serious risk of a massacre” occurring in Rafah. “That would be a gross violation of international law, on top of all of the other violations of international law, which Israel is responsible for,” he said. The Fine Gael leader said the Government had taken action and would take “even more action”. He added: “The Israeli government does not listen to us, doesn’t listen to the world, probably doesn’t even listen to the Americans any more, and that’s what makes the situation all the more dangerous.” Mr Varadkar said the Government was in discussions with other EU member states, with Spain being the main country, about recognising Palestinian statehood. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin separately said that Ireland is pushing “strongly” within the EU to bring in sanctions against Israeli settlers in the West Bank. He said one or two countries are “holding out”, but “it would be very powerful if the Union in its entirety imposed travel bans similar to what the United States has done”. Elsewhere, Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney criticised Israeli actions, saying: “It is not acceptable effectively to behave like a monster to defeat a monster”. He said the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel was terrorist and “abhorrent”, adding that Israel had a right to defend itself. “But it does not have a right to do what it is continuing to do in Gaza now where there are huge civilian casualties, women and children being blown up on a nightly basis”. A Government spokesman said the comments from senior Coalition figures were “a reflection of the seriousness with which the Government and many other nations treat the appalling situation in Gaza”. He denied Ireland’s approach to the conflict has changed, saying: “Our policy has been consistent throughout. It’s been: release the hostages, get aid in, and stop the fighting, stop the killings as soon as possible.” Mr Martin will meet Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general of UNRWA, the United Nations aid agency for helping Palestinian refugees, in Dublin on Thursday. Several countries, including the US and UK, suspended financing for the agency after Israel last month accused a dozen of its employees of involvement in Hamas’s October 7th attack. The UN has announced an investigation into the allegations. Ireland continues to fund UNRWA amid concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Some €18 million was provided to the agency by Ireland last year. Mr Martin signalled that Ireland’s contribution to UNRWA in 2024 could increase, but he said the figure has not yet been decided upon.",0,1
2024/2/14,"Ireland’s call for Israel trade review is a significant challenge to EU inertia The open call by Ireland and Spain to review the trade agreement signals an end to patience with Tel Aviv The European Union is Israel’s biggest trading partner: it’s a lopsided relationship in which almost a third of Israel’s imports come from the European Union, while for the union Israel accounts for just 0.8 per cent of its total trade. The idea of suspending the favourable terms under which this trade takes place through the EU-Israel Association Agreement has been floated since last year by those pushing for a tougher response to the vast destruction and civilian death toll in Gaza. Its text states “the observance of human rights” is the “very basis” and an “essential element” of the agreement. Trade is the toughest tool that the union has, carrying potentially more severe consequences even than the suspension of weapons exports. Using it once seemed far-fetched. But it became the elephant in the room this week when the European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, his patience palpably fraying, told journalists that the international community should stop “begging” Israel for restraint and instead “do something”. What changed? The International Court of Justice order that Israel must immediately stop the killing of civilians due to a plausible risk of breaches of the Genocide Convention made countries that continued to uncritically back Israel manifestly exposed to accusations of hypocrisy on international law. Rather than altering course after the court’s order, the Israeli government pushed towards a ground assault on Rafah – the supposed “safe zone” on the border of Egypt where much of the civilian population of Gaza has been corralled. The final compounding factor was that the government of Binyamin Netanyahu brushed off appeals from even its closest allies against the plan. A change in tone became evident this weekend. The foreign minister of Germany Annalena Baerbock warned that the situation in Rafah was “already unbelievable” and that an assault by the Israeli army would be a “humanitarian catastrophe”, saying that the people of Gaza “cannot disappear into thin air”. This was a shift in rhetoric for a country that has steadfastly insisted on Israel’s right to defend itself since the October 7th attacks and openly opposed South Africa’s case at the ICJ. Tánaiste Micheál Martin issued a statement to say the invasion “cannot be allowed to happen” and that all union member states now needed to call for a ceasefire with “no further equivocation”. It seemed to show an end to patience with the last holdouts in the union that had continued to veto such a call, despite a majority being in favour. The fact that only two leaders signed the letter suggests that the idea of reviewing the trade agreement with Israel only has a minority of support. There are countries that will likely block it too. Hungary and the Czech Republic have blocked the European Union from imposing sanctions on extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been violently driving out Palestinians, even as London and Washington went ahead. Nevertheless, the fact that the idea is now openly on the table is a significant challenge to the union’s inertia that reflects a real shift – and may lead to changes elsewhere.",0,1
2024/2/14,"No concerns Ireland’s position on Gaza war could cause diplomatic strain with US, says Harris Minister says he has had ‘very genuine conversations around the concern at the level of violence’ in Palestine enclave while in US Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris has said that he has no concerns that Ireland’s position on the violence inflicted on Gaza could cause a diplomatic strain between Ireland and the United States. Speaking on a visit to Howard University in Washington, Mr Harris said he had had “very genuine conversations around the concern at the level of violence” in Gaza with those he had met in the US. His comments come amid fears that Israel will launch a ground invasion of Rafah where more than a million Palestinian refugees are taking shelter from the ongoing war. There has been a hardening of the Irish Government’s criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar writing to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen expressing deep concern at the deteriorating situation in Gaza and seeking an “urgent review” of whether Israel is complying with human rights obligations under its trade agreement with the European Union. Speaking after several political meetings on Capitol Hill, during which the devastating impact of the war on Gaza featured prominently in discussions, Mr Harris said: “It is always good to be able to have honest exchanges with friends and Ireland has many friends on the Hill and in the Biden administration. But also, I found a shared view in the need for progress to be made.  “Very genuine conversations around the concern at the level of violence. It is not for me to comment on the internal US political process, but I think seeing that violence is something that can really unite all right thinking people.” “There was a shared view in relation to the need to see a cessation of violence, obviously to see the immediate release of hostages and then to try and move to a political process where we can see a two state solution. But before we talk about that we need to see the violence to stop. Innocent children are being disproportionately impacted by the war, and Ireland will continue to be a strong and principled voice.” Since arriving in Washington on Monday evening, Mr Harris has had meetings in Georgetown and Howard universities to explore further educational partnerships between Ireland and the United States. Mr Harris also gave details of the function of the six planned attache roles announced in an address on Tuesday evening at the Irish Embassy. The first of those roles will be located in San Francisco. “I want them to continue to develop links with industry and business and with educational institutions,” he said. “I think having someone there full time, who doesn’t represent an individual university but actually represents all of tertiary education and can look out for opportunities for Ireland in terms of extending the hand of friendship will be really valuable.” He spent Wednesday morning touring Howard, the historically Black research university, where he met students, faculty staff and had a formal meeting with Howard president Ben Vinson III. “I was very conscious of the fact that we were there on the birthday of Frederick Douglas; the historical significance of Douglas to Howard and indeed in Ireland and the time he spent in Ireland and the influence that had on his own thinking. Howard has a long-standing relationship with UCD in student mobility and we discussed how we wished to see that expand -and to expand to other universities. “I asked them for guidance in relation to their expertise with regards race, inclusion and access in education and pointed out that Ireland is obviously a much more diverse and multiethnic country now. And how do we continue to integrate within our education system and learn from the expertise of Howard.” He will meet the US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, Joe Kennedy, in Boston on Thursday and the retention of students will feature in their discussion. “We are still seeing a lot of students leaving Northern Ireland for their studies and then not coming back. And I think it is really important that we look at how we retain talent on the island of Ireland as well.”",0,1
2024/2/15,"Suspension of Israel-EU trade deal a ‘political’ matter Unanimous agreement of 27 member states required for tough move Any decision by the European Union to suspend its trade agreement with Israel is a matter of political judgment that must be taken by the 27 member states, the European Commission has said. It comes after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez asked European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to review whether Tel Aviv is in breach of the EU–Israel Association Agreement, which is conditional on respect for human rights, given the vast civilian death toll in Gaza. The commission confirmed that their letter was received and that is being examined. Under EU law, any decision to suspend the trade agreement would need to be agreed upon by the 27 EU member states, following a proposal by either the commission or EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. As this issue is a matter of foreign policy, it should be up to the high representative Mr Borrell to make a recommendation and any decision to suspend the agreement would require the unanimous agreement of all 27 member states, according to the commission. “Whether there are grounds for suspension in this case is a matter of political appreciation that should be done by the council on the initiative of the high representative as this is a foreign policy,” said a spokeswoman. “Unanimity in the council would be required in principle for the suspension of the entire agreement.” The EU is Israel’s largest trading partner and the prospect of suspending the favourable terms under which that trade takes place is a powerful weapon in the bloc’s arsenal that it may be difficult to get political consensus to use. Meanwhile, Ireland is seeking like-minded EU countries to take potential bilateral actions together such as the recognition of Palestine or the imposition of sanctions on extremist Israeli settlers, The Irish Times understands. The commission appeared to suggest that there were benefits to continuing the agreement as it was the basis for engagement with Tel Aviv. “The existing association agreement is the legal basis of our ongoing dialogue with the Israeli authorities, and it provides an important mechanism to discuss problematic issues and advance our point of view,” said the spokeswoman. “In this framework, the EU will continue to reaffirm its commitment of the applicability of the international humanitarian rights and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territories.” The only permanent resolution to the divisive conflict is to “spare no efforts to achieve the two-state solution”, she added.",0,1
2024/2/15,"Israel’s ‘disinformation campaign’ against Unrwa must not ‘undermine’ its ‘life-saving mandate’ - Tánaiste Micheál Martin calls on countries, including US and UK, to resume funding Gaza aid agency Israel is carrying out a “disinformation campaign” against the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa,  and one country “must not be allowed to undermine” the organisation’s “life-saving mandate” in the Gaza Strip, the Tánaiste has said. Speaking at a press conference with Unrwa commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini on Thursday, Micheál Martin underlined that Ireland’s support for the agency remained “steadfast” following his announcement that Ireland would give €20 million in support to Unrwa. Mr Martin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, called on countries who have paused funding to the agency, which include the United States, UK and Germany, to “urgently rescind this decision and resume funding”. Unrwa, which provides healthcare, education and other services to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and across the Middle East, is currently under investigation following allegations by Israel that 12 of its staff were involved in the October 7th Hamas-led attack on Israel which sparked the bombardment of Gaza. “I was deeply concerned that a number of Unrwa key donors suspended their funding based on allegations against a very small number of staff that have yet to be proven,” Mr Martin said, adding that it would be inconceivable to allow Unrwa to collapse “at such a dangerous moment”. The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to enable the provision of urgently needed humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip, but “instead, Israel has launched a disinformation campaign against Unrwa. Sufficient aid is still not reaching civilians in Gaza and that is clearly unacceptable,” said the Tánaiste. Mr Lazzarini said the UN was currently investigating the allegations but warned that Unrwa was under “existential threat”. He noted that Israeli authorities were not fully co-operating with the investigation. Dismantling Unrwa would have far-reaching implications, he said, not only for Palestinians caught in the Gaza Strip but for the millions of other Palestinians across the Middle East who rely on the agency for basic survival. “Weakening or dismantling of Unrwa would also have a negative impact in any transition project,” said Mr Lazzarini, who added that 500,000 children of primary and secondary school age left traumatised by the conflict relied on Unrwa support. “This is the most dangerous, painful, depressing period because until the day there is a proper political package there will be no significant investment in the Gaza Strip, which has been destroyed so far.” He said Unrwa was the only organisation capable of providing services at the scale required given it was created to assist “one of the most destitute” communities across the region. Mr Lazzarini said that if Unrwa was allowed to “disappear it would be held by the Palestinian refugees as a betrayal by the international community, as an abandonment and ultimately impact their aspiration for self determination”. Asked if Ireland would consider restricting funding based on the findings of the investigation into the Unrwa staff members’ alleged involvement in the Hamas attacks, Mr Martin said the State would “weigh up the outcome” but that there was “no alternative to Unrwa in terms of sustaining basic services in Gaza and across the region”. Who is going to provide for the estimated 17,000 children orphaned by this conflict or the 300,000 children no longer attending school, he asked. “There’s a lot of rhetoric and language and noise, but we need to drill down to the reality. This is horrific, this is a catastrophe. My biggest fear is that when these hostilities end, the world needs to be allowed into Gaza to see the horrors of what has happened. I fear we don’t know the full extent of the horrors,” Mr Martin said. On the joint call made by Ireland and Spain for the European Union’s trade agreement with Israel to be urgently reviewed by the European Commission, Mr Martin said the State was working with other “like-minded countries within the EU” to ensure human rights obligations were adhered to. “We believe the human rights clauses have not been upheld and at this time of reckoning the European Commission cannot fudge these issues any more,” he said. “I think it’s fair and correct to raise the issue because when we put human rights into agreements we should mean them. And they’re not just add-ons to agreements but they’re integral parts of agreements such as this.”",0,1
2024/2/15,"European Commission will examine call from Ireland and Spain to review trade deal with Israel Leo Varadkar and Pedro Sánchez send joint letter to Ursula von der Leyen about potential breaches of human rights obligations A call from Ireland and Spain for the EU’s trade agreement with Israel to be urgently reviewed will be examined by the European Commission. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez sent a letter making the request to commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday amid deep concern over the deteriorating situation in Gaza. They want the review to consider whether Israel is complying with human rights obligations under the EU-Israel Association Agreement and ask that the commission propose “appropriate measures” that could be taken if Israel is found to be in breach of these obligations. There is an expectation among at least some officials in Dublin that the commission will have to carry out a review of the trade agreement after the “significant” intervention by Ireland and Spain. Others said that while the commission would have to offer a “serious response”, it was hard to speculate on what it would do. A spokeswoman said the commission would “look into” the request for a review. She said: “We do urge all sides when it comes to Israel to respect international law and we note that there must be accountability for violation of international law.” She added that the EU “deplores all loss of civilian lives” and “continues to pass these messages in its statements but also bilaterally in its contacts with Israeli authorities”. The EU is Israel’s largest trading partner and any threat to that relationship is the most potent leverage held by Brussels. There are signs of fraying patience with Israel even among its closest allies in the EU, with Germany joining the United States in voicing alarm over plans for an invasion of Rafah, where much of Gaza’s civilian population has been driven. However, a small group of hardline supporters of Israel has consistently blocked or watered down tougher action by the EU, and the proposal to review the trade agreement would be likely to face their opposition. Should the commission decide to carry out a review, any proposed actions that resulted would then need the approval of EU member states. Mr Varadkar told the Dáil that any suspension of the agreement “may well require unanimity” among EU countries. In their letter, Mr Varadkar and Mr Sánchez write that they are “deeply concerned” at “the impact the ongoing conflict is having on innocent Palestinians”. They add: “The expanded Israeli military operation in the Rafah area poses a grave and imminent threat that the international community must urgently confront.” They noted their repeated condemnation of the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th and call for the immediate and unconditional release of remaining hostages. Fighting along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon escalated on Wednesday. A female soldier was killed when Hizbullah fired a rocket barrage at a military base close to Israel’s northern city of Safed, according to an Israeli government spokesperson. In response, Israeli air force jets carried out extensive waves of attacks on Lebanese territory, killing four people – including a woman and her two children – Lebanese security sources said. As the fighting raged in the north, Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu ordered his negotiating team not to return to Cairo on Thursday for further talks with US, Egyptian and Qatari mediators to secure a Gaza ceasefire and release the 134 hostages who have been in captivity for 131 days.",0,1
2024/2/15,"Green Party TDs and Senators urge ministers to use ‘soft power’ for Gaza on St Patrick’s Day Backbenchers write to Government asking it to use ‘powerful voice’ to help achieve ceasefire Backbench Green Party members have called on the Government to use its “soft power” on St Patrick’s Day trips to ramp up political pressure for international action on the Gaza crisis. In a letter sent to the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Ministers on Wednesday, a group of Green Party TDs and Senators argued that the trips should be used to “reiterate the position of the Irish Government” on the conflict. “Ireland has always been a powerful voice for peace on the international stage. You, as representatives of the Irish people, have an important opportunity to carry that message on our behalf to political leaders across the world in the coming weeks,” they wrote. The Opposition has been putting pressure on the Government not to attend the traditional St Patrick’s Day shamrock ceremony in the White House, or to use it to raise concern about continued US support for Israel. Sinn Féin has also faced calls not to engage with representatives of the current US administration as part of its traditional St Patrick’s Day travel programme. The Green backbenchers behind the appeal include party whip Marc Ó Cathasaigh; TDs Patrick Costello, Francis Noel Duffy, Brian Leddin and Steven Matthews; and Senators Róisín Garvey, Pauline O’Reilly and Vincent P Martin. Mr Leddin, a TD for Limerick, said: “We’ve talked before of the soft diplomatic power that Ireland wields, especially with the United States of America, and St Patrick’s Day now affords us with an opportunity of access that we must use for good – to achieve an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. “I met with UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini this morning and we must do all we can working with our partner parliamentarians across Europe, to not only push for a ceasefire, but to also make sure we plan now for a rapid rebuilding programme of hospitals and schools in Gaza.” In the letter, they wrote that “all right thinking people” abhor the atrocities committed by Hamas in its October 7th attack and the ongoing keeping of hostages taken during those raids. However, they say that the response of Israel has been “indiscriminate and disproportionate, with an entirely blameless civilian population being subjected to what amounts to collective punishment. “Alongside the unspeakable tragedy of the mounting death toll, the physical and mental trauma being inflicted on Palestinians who will survive this conflict, the forced displacement of an entire population and the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure will have a profound adverse impact on a whole generations of Gazans.” They are calling on Ministers to outline that there should be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, that all participants in the conflict should be held to account for their actions under humanitarian law and for an immediate release of all hostages held in Gaza.",0,1
2024/2/16,"Varadkar attends ‘Davos for Defence’ for first time to discuss neutrality and push for Gaza ceasefire First time an Irish head of Government has attended prestigious event in 60-year history Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is attending the Munich Security Conference this weekend, the first time an Irish head of Government has attended the prestigious event in its 60-year history. Mr Varadkar is attending along with Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence Micheál Martin. The conference, unofficially unknown as the “Davos for Defence”, will be attended by dozens of world leaders, including US Vice President Kamala Harris, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. The three-day event in Munich, which marks its 60th year, is expected to be dominated by discussions on the ongoing violence in Gaza, former US President Donald Trump’s threat to gut Nato if re-elected and faltering western support for Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. Mr Varadkar’s main public engagement will be a round table discussion on Saturday morning on neutrality with representatives from Malta, Austria and the International Red Cross. The discussion will be chaired by Prof Louise Richardson who headed up the Government’s Consultative Forum on International Security Policy in Dublin last year. Later in the day, Mr Martin will take part in a discussion on reform of the UN Security Council alongside leaders from Peru, Kenya, Germany and Slovenia. He is expected to use the opportunity to vent Irish frustrations with the deadlock in the Security Council caused by the veto power enjoyed by its five permanent members. The Security Council has not mandated a new UN peacekeeping mission in a decade, prompting Mr Martin last year to announce plans to scrap Ireland’s triple lock system which requires UN approval before Irish troops can be sent overseas. Both leaders are expected to hold a series of bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the event. The attendance of a sitting Taoiseach at the event for the first time “shows just how seriously we view the current global situation”, Mr Varadkar said. “With war in Ukraine and the Middle East and simmering tensions or outright conflict in many other regions, now is a crucial moment for international peace and security.” He said it is very important Ireland takes part “to set out our views on how best to manage the many – and growing – security challenges that we all face. “I’m particularly looking forward to taking part in a panel discussion on neutrality. I will explain the work of the recent Consultative Forum on Neutrality and our Commission on Defence and show how Ireland and our policy of active neutrality can be part of the response to challenges in cybersecurity, hybrid warfare, disinformation, the protection of communications infrastructure and outright conflict,” he said. He also committed to push for the release of all hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and an immediate ceasefire in the region. “I also hope to raise the prospects for a permanent political solution based on two States side by side, living securely and in peace with each other.” Both Israeli and Palestinian representatives have been invited to the conference. Western leaders are expected to use it as an opportunity to persuade Israel to call off its planned ground offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza. Russia and Iran were not invited, as they are not open to meaningful dialogue, the events chair German Ambassador Christoph Heusgen said.",0,1
2024/2/16,"Israel no longer a normal democracy, Taoiseach says as he pushes for ceasefire in Gaza Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Varadkar says Europe must be prepared to defend itself without US  Israel is no longer a “normal, liberal, western democracy” and has not been one for some time, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said at a major security conference on Friday. Mr Varadkar is the first Irish head of government to attend the Munich Security Conference in Germany, known unofficially as “Davos for Defence”, in its 60-year history. As well as taking part in a discussion on neutrality, he is expected to join other leaders in attempting to persuade Israel to call off its planned ground offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza. On Friday evening, he held a bilateral meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan to discuss the issue. In light of the ongoing assault on Gaza, Ireland and Spain have asked the European Commission to review whether Israel is in breach of the human rights clauses contained in its trade agreements with the EU. The Taoiseach said he expected the commission to take this request seriously and to carry out an “an independent, expert, dispassionate analysis” before making recommendations to the European Council on further steps. “We thought it was important to put that marker down that the European Union can no longer treat Israel as though it were a normal, liberal, western democracy. It is not behaving like that any more, it hasn’t for a long time.” The three-day event in Munich, which is marking its 60th year, is expected to be dominated by discussions on the ongoing violence in Gaza, former US president Donald Trump’s threat to gut Nato if re-elected and faltering western support for Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. Mr Varadkar said Europeans should be prepared for the possibility that the United States reverts to isolationism. “That’s happened in history and it never ends up well for Europe. So we have to at least prepare for the possibility that we have to deal with issues on our own continent and our own neighbourhood on our own.” Ireland is a neutral country but it is important it can defend itself in co-operation with European allies, he said. “We need to be able to co-operate more on issues like defence and security.” He said defence and security was about more than just the military. It is also about counter-terrorism, fighting cybercrime, defending critical infrastructure and combating disinformation. Asked about a report in The Irish Times last week that the Government was denying new visas to Russian diplomatic staff assigned to Moscow’s embassy in Dublin amid espionage concerns, Mr Varadkar said he could not comment on individual visas applications. “What I can say is there is a complement of 15 diplomats in the Russian embassy. That’s pretty large. We think that should be adequate for their needs here.” The number of Russian staff assigned to the Dublin embassy has halved from 30 since before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The large number of staff previously assigned to the embassy has long been a concern for the Irish security services who suspect the sprawling complex on Orwell Road in Rathgar, south Dublin, is used as a cover for various spying activities, including interception of communications. A Russian embassy spokesman blamed the decline in numbers on the Department of Foreign Affairs’ “unacceptable visa and accreditation policy”. Mr Varadkar’s main public engagement in Munich will be a round table discussion on neutrality with representatives from Malta, Austria and the International Red Cross on Saturday morning. The discussion will be chaired by Prof Louise Richardson who headed up the Government’s Consultative Forum on International Security Policy in Dublin last year. Later in the day, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence Micheál Martin will take part in a discussion on reform of the UN Security Council alongside leaders from Peru, Kenya, Germany and Slovenia.

2024/2/17,"Drogheda hotel may remain in partial commercial use while housing asylum seekers, says Varadkar Local representatives fear economic impact on Louth town from losing premises and criticise lack of consultation Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has signalled a partial reversal of a decision to house 500 asylum seekers in the D Hotel in Drogheda, Co Louth, next month. Part of the hotel may now remain in use as a commercial premises, he said, while other hotels in the town currently used for accommodating Ukrainian refugees may also be brought back into use. Local representatives have raised concerns the conversion of the hotel into asylum seeker accommodation will have a severe economic impact on the town. The 113-bedroom hotel is the biggest in the town and the councillors believe there will be a net loss to Drogheda of €5.4 million per year from the absence of visitors. They have also complained of a lack on consultation ahead of the decision by the Department of Integration. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday, Mr Varadkar said he understands the concerns of local people “that losing the major hotel in their town would be a major set back in terms of what has been achieved in the town in recent years.” He said he and Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman are exploring solutions, including the possibility that some of the hotel will remain in use for paying guests while the rest is used for asylum seekers. “We understand what the councillors and TDs in Drogheda are saying; that migrants and international protection applicants are welcome in their town but the loss of their only major functioning hotel would be such a setback given what has been achieved for the town in recent years. “So we’re exploring alternatives which might, for example, mean the hotel being used partially for international protection but still being able to operate. There are also a number of other hotels in the town that are currently being used for Ukrainians but have the potential to be put back into use.” Protests organised by anti-immigration activists are scheduled to take place in the town this weekend and a large garda operation has been put in place. Mr Varadkar said local representatives have behaved “very responsibly” on the issue but that he is worried about extremists stirring up anger in the community. “Migration is a very sensitive issue which brings out the best in some people. These are people who take refugees into their homes and welcome them into their schools and clubs and communities. “It also brings out the worst in some people; hatred and anger and racism. And I’m very conscious of that.”",0,1
2024/2/17,"Ireland ‘scrutinising’ Russian diplomats’ visa applications amid spying concerns Taoiseach says 15 diplomats ‘should be adequate’ for Russia’s needs in Ireland amid concerns about espionage at Dublin embassy Ireland is “scrutinising” every new application from Russian diplomats coming here amid concerns about espionage, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has said. Mr Martin was responding to a recent report in The Irish Times that Ireland is refusing to grant new diplomatic visas to Russia officials in an effort to reduce the size of its Dublin embassy due to concerns about spying. As a result, the number of diplomats and administrative staff in the sprawling embassy on Orwell Road had fallen by half, from a high of 30, since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Shortly after the invasion, Ireland expelled four diplomats for engaging in espionage. Since then, it has attempted to reduce the number further by freezing visa applications from incoming officials, drawing the ire of the Russian embassy which complains they are severely understaffed. “As you know, we took steps as a Government to reduce significantly the number of people [in the embassy], particularly those who were advised were not actually diplomats but were performing intelligence functions,” Mr Martin said in an interview with The Irish Times on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany. “So, the embassy is much, much reduced. I think it’s down to 15 now because of the actions we have taken.” The Tánaiste said Ireland “scrutinises” each new visa application from Russian diplomats and that Russia does the same to Irish officials. “So, there is a degree of toing and froing on these issues. There hasn’t been much movement either way since.” He said the Government had no issue with Russian diplomacy but that “when we are advised by our intelligence services that other activities are under way, we take steps to make sure that’s not happening”. Mr Martin was attending the prestigious security conference alongside Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, making the first time an Irish head of Government has taken part in the event in its 60-year history. Asked about the embassy, Mr Varadkar said he believed 15 diplomats “should be adequate for [Russia’s] needs here.” On Saturday, the Taoiseach took part in a debate on neutrality alongside leaders from Austria, Malta and the International Committee of the Red Cross. He rejected the claim that Ireland is freeloading on others for its defence and that it relies on the UK military for security. “We have our own navy, though it’s not as strong as it needs to be, and we’ve entered into agreements with Pesco [the EU Permanent Structured Cooperation defence structure] and NATO’s Partnership for Peace which relate to the cables that are around the island which are important to us and important to our neighbours.” Security goes beyond military spending, Mr Varadkar said. He said Ireland is one of few countries whose international aid budget is bigger than the defence budget. This is done to increase security, he said. “Because if we can start to remove some of those underlying causes of conflict in the world, we could have a much safer place and a much better place. Then perhaps there wouldn’t be such a need for everyone to be so well armed.” The Taoiseach said he finds to difficult to envisage a scenario where Ireland would give up its neutrality, aside from an invasion or terrorist attack by another country. “Often, it’s our neutrality that protects us. We don’t have many enemies; we have lots of friends. That’s not a coincidence.” He said Ireland would be willing to be part of any peace process between Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict in eastern Ukraine. “But I need to be very clear, should there be any peace process, we have to be guided by president [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian government on how and when that should take place.”",0,1
2024/2/18,"Munich Security Conference: Security isn’t all about armies, said Varadkar. Few were listening Amid wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Trump’s comments and Navalny’s death, the Irish struggled to be heard This year’s Munich Security Conference, which concluded on Sunday, was always going to be a significant event, and not just because it was the prestigious summit’s 60th year. The event in the south German city took place at the confluence of three major global security crises: Ukraine’s faltering defensive war against Russia, which is about to enter its second year; Israel’s pending assault on Rafah in southern Gaza and Donald Trump’s implied threat to gut Nato should he be re-elected. World leaders who gathered in Munich already had more than enough to talk about when news broke on Friday, the first morning of the conference, that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny had died in prison. By grim coincidence, Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya was at the conference to speak about Russia’s many human rights abuses. “I want Putin, his entourage, Putin’s friends and his government to know they will pay for what they have done to our country, to our family and my husband,” she told delegates after the news filtered through. It was the first of many dramatic moments at the three-day event, which was accompanied by a massive security operation that shut down a good portion of Munich’s city centre. Helicopters hovered constantly overhead while snipers kept watch from rooftops. It was hard to go 100m without passing through a metal detector or flashing a pass. Against such a febrile atmosphere, the Irish delegation, led by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Micheál Martin had a hard time finding an audience for its message that security isn’t all about tanks and warships. Ireland is one of the few countries whose foreign aid budget is bigger than its defence budget, Varadkar boasted at several points throughout the weekend. If other nations followed suit, he said, the world would likely be a much safer place. It wasn’t clear if anyone was listening. Much of the discussion around Ireland related to it allegedly refusing to pull its own weight when it comes to defence. Isn’t it true that Ireland relies on the Royal Navy and Air Force to protect its shores, Brendan Simms, an international relations professor in Cambridge University, asked Varadkar during a panel discussion on neutrality. He was referring to the much-publicised but still technically secret deal Ireland has with Britain to allow the RAF to enter Irish airspace in certain emergency circumstances. It was the beginning of a sometimes-testy exchange between the Taoiseach and the Irish-born academic. “I’m not aware of any particular UK intervention that’s helped us in that regard,” Varadkar replied tersely. But “everyone knows” Ireland relies on the UK to keep it safe, just as it did in the second World War, Simms replied. “I don’t think what I’m saying is in any way controversial.” The exchange continued, without either side ceding ground, until the moderator, Prof Louise Richardson stepped in and moved on the discussion. This was the first time a sitting Taoiseach attended the Munich summit in its 60-year history and Ireland’s junior status was evident from the start. Varadkar’s fellow panellists included Malta’s minister for foreign affairs and the head of Austria’s parliament. These are important people but a far cry from the superstars on the other panels, such as Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg and US secretary of state Antony Blinken (whose secret service detail prevented the Irish delegation from departing for several minutes). Of the 10 spots open to journalists for the neutrality debate, just two were needed. Neither Martin nor Varadkar seemed too put out by any of this; the real dialogue happens far away from the conference halls anyway, at lunches and over steins of weissbier. The delegation was here “because Ireland wants to be more plugged into the debate around defence and security”, Varadkar said. “But a big part of what I’m saying is defence and security is not all about armies and weapons. We should give equal focus . . . to dealing with some of those underlying causes of conflict and instability in the world, like climate change, like an absence of economic opportunity.” It was a hard sell, he conceded. “But no one has disagreed with it. So deep down they must think it’s true.”",0,1
2024/2/19,"‘Very challenging’ to get EU to agree to suspend Israel trade deal - Tánaiste Micheál Martin was speaking in Brussels after Ireland and Spain requested review of accord It will be very difficult to get the required agreement of all 27 European Union member states to suspend the bloc’s trade deal with Israel, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said after Ireland and Spain requested a review of the accord. In a joint letter with Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez last week Taoiseach Leo Varadkar asked the European Commission to review as a matter of urgency the trade agreement to see whether Israel was in breach of its human rights clauses. Any decision to suspend the deal, which underpins Israel’s heavy reliance on the EU for trade, would require the unanimous agreement of all 27 member states. “It will be very challenging, and some will not agree with the Irish and Spanish position,” Mr Martin told reporters as he arrived at a meeting of fellow EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday. One or two EU countries are still blocking an EU agreement to sanction extremist Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been violently driving out Palestinian residents of the occupied territory, he said. The United States and the United Kingdom have already imposed such sanctions on extremist settlers, but the issue has been held up in the EU since foreign ministers first considered it late last year, with Hungary and the Czech Republic wielding their vetoes. Mr Martin has also called on the European Commission to clearly declare that funding will continue to Unwra, the United Nations aid agency that is the main source of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip and which provides the backbone of many social services. Several EU countries suspended funding after Israel accused some Unwra staff of involvement in the October 7th Hamas attacks that precipitated its invasion of Gaza, which has killed almost 29,000 people according to the local death count. Ireland, Spain, and Portugal have announced increased funding to the agency to try to make up a shortfall due to the suspension of funding, including by the United States and UK, that is threatening to force it to shut down operations. The EU is one of Unrwa’s largest donors, and the European Commission has said funding will depend on the outcome of an investigation of the allegations. Mr Martin said that aside from its role in distributing emergency relief, it would be impossible to provide education in Gaza without the agency and that it would be required to provide social services once the conflict is over. “The world is shocked” at the “level of inhumanity” within Gaza and “opinions have evolved” as well among EU foreign ministers with the “vast majority” now wanting an end to the violence, Mr Martin said. He expressed hope that work for a ceasefire can “gain momentum ... for the sake of the ordinary people of Gaza who are living hell on Earth at the moment”.",0,1
2024/2/19,"President leads tributes to ‘warm and engaging’ Irish Times journalist Michael O’Regan ‘He was incredibly courteous, and a perfect judge of when an injection of humour was needed’  President Michael D Higgins has led tributes to Michael O’Regan, the long-time correspondent for The Irish Times, who died suddenly at his home in Dublin over the weekend. A native of Co Kerry, Mr O’Regan was a well-known and much-admired figure in The Irish Times and in Irish journalism more broadly, having covered politics since the 1980s. Since his retirement from the paper in 2019 he contributed occasional articles and was a regular voice on television and radio, including on Radio Kerry, to which he continued to contribute a weekly radio column. He was a vociferous supporter of his native county in all matters, and served as president of the Kerry Association in Dublin in recent years. President Higgins said the journalist was “always warm and engaging in conversation”. “He was incredibly courteous, and a perfect judge of when an injection of the humour, upon which he drew from his proud Kerry background, was needed,” Mr Higgins said. He paid tribute to his journalism, saying his “extensive research” ensured he had a full understanding of the topics which he wrote about for The Irish Times. “Prior to becoming an Oireachtas reporter, Michael made a significant contribution in his coverage of the Kerry Babies Tribunal, both during the tribunal itself and in his book on that tragic event and its handling. “In recent years, Michael wrote about his cancer treatment with great dignity. In writing with such clarity and honesty of his treatment, he provided a great service to others in helping provide a sense of understanding and how they may seek to face their own treatments. As ever, Michael’s meticulous skills of context, warmth and clarity were to the fore,” President Higgins said. On social media on Sunday evening, the Tánaiste, Micheál Martin, was one of many to express sadness at the news and pay tribute. He was, he wrote: “very saddened at the passing of Michael O’Regan, an outstanding journalist, raconteur and man of integrity. A political journalist for all of my Dáil career, Michael was engaging, objective, and great company. A Kerryman to his core, he will be sorely missed by all”. Minister for Further and Higher Eduction Simon Harris wrote: “Michael O’Regan was a gent; professional, insightful, decent, fair, a lover of all things political. He had a distinguished career & continued to share insights online & on air. His family, many friends & colleagues are in my prayers. Rest easy Michael.” Séamus Dooley, Irish secretary of the National Union of Journalists, said: “Michael was a man of wisdom, kindness, humour. He could be provocative, even annoying but never dull – the very best of company. He loved storytelling. It was what he did best.” The Kerry Association in Dublin, meanwhile, said it was “with great sadness,” that it had “learned of the death of our beloved friend and wonderful president Michael O’Regan. He was a brilliant and courageous reporter on national and local issues but it is as a proud Kerryman to his core that we will remember him – proud of his daughters, his grandchildren, his country, his county and his people. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h’anam dílis.” The Editor of The Irish Times, Ruadhán Mac Cormaic, said: “Michael was a generous colleague and a first-rate journalist who leaves behind a body of work that chronicles a country in flux. His coverage of the Kerry babies case was the work of a highly skilled reporter; his anger, recalling it many decades later, was that of a man of heart and compassion. “Few people observed life in Leinster House more closely than Michael but, informed by his own deep knowledge of his beloved Kerry, he was keenly attuned to the ways in which local politics was at the heart of everything. He was sceptical but not cynical; his job was to understand politicians, and he did. We’ll miss that unforgettable voice.” Mr O’Regan qualified from the first national course in journalism in the College of Commerce in Rathmines in 1972 and worked with The Kerryman and The Corkman before joining The Irish Times in 1981. Among many other assignments, he covered the Kerry Babies Tribunal, about which he went on to write a book, Dark Secrets. He became a Dáil reporter in 1988 and was a stalwart of the newspaper’s political coverage for more than 30 years. When he retired in 2019, the former Irish Times editor Geraldine Kennedy said his great contribution to journalism, most especially Irish Times journalism, was that he retained his sense of “country” and never lost his values. “Michael’s journalistic asset was that he loved and consumed politics. He liked politicians. Unlike many of the younger generation in today’s digital world, he liked mixing with them ... There was never a complaint made that Michael was biased. He was always seen as fair,” she said. In recent years he had been treated for cancer, which he wrote about in a moving Irish Times article that also reported his joy at the birth of his granddaughter, but his death was unexpected. On Monday, the February meeting of Kerry County Council began with cross-party tributes to the late journalist. Speaking on Radio Kerry, the cathaoirleach of Kerry County Council, Jim Finucane, said Michael was “a true master of his craft”. “His political knowledge was second to none,” the Fine Gael councillor said. Fiona Stack, station manager of Radio Kerry, said he was “incredibly generous with his knowledge, insightful and kind to younger journalists”. She said he was above all “a natural storyteller”. Danny Healy-Rae said Michael was one of the first journalists to give his father, Jackie, a chance of a seat in 1997. “I have been following and listening to his view and opinions since early March 1997 when he gave my father a real possible chance of winning a Dáil Seat [in] the following June 1997 general election,” he said. Fine Gael TD Brendan Griffin spoke of Michael’s kindness to him in his first days in the Dáil. “Personally, I’ll never forget him for taking the time to stop and chat in the corridors of Leinster House in my early days in Dáil Éireann, imparting his wisdom and knowledge to a young and slightly daunted TD ‘from the other side of the mountain’,” he said.",0,1
2024/2/2,"Brussels diary: ‘Budapest Boris’ fails to dent EU show of unity Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban caved in over EU support for Ukraine, leaving a trail of disgruntled leaders summoned to Brussels for the anticlimactic summit The summit was nearly over before it began. As several European Union leaders waited in the conference room on Thursday morning for the rest of their colleagues to join them and begin the meeting, European Council president Charles Michel tweeted: “We have a deal”, followed by the obligatory hashtag: #Unity. Since December, when Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban put the kibosh on the EU’s plans to support Ukraine to the tune of a further €50 billion over the next four years, it had been a case of #disunity. On decisions such as these, the European Council operates on the basis of unanimity – everyone has to agree or there’s no deal. That’s why they sometimes take so long, the wrangling going on until the early hours. That’s what happened in December – Orban wouldn’t budge, and so Michel had to summon leaders back for a special summit to have another go. In the meantime, there was a lot of Hungarian arm-twisting. But Orban loves fighting with the EU – he regularly poses as the scourge of the Brussels bureaucrats, a sort of Budapest Boris – and until Thursday morning he was refusing to agree. Entering the summit venue, many of the other 26 heads of government made no attempt to hide their irritation. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar suggested he was abusing the EU’s requirement for unanimity, because his veto was not being exercised “in good faith”. Polish prime minister Donald Tusk told reporters that Europe had “Orban fatigue, not Ukraine fatigue”. But by the previous Wednesday evening, when many of the leaders gathered for a tribute to former commission chief Jacques Delors (once famously addressed by the Sun newspaper as “Up Yours, Dolors!”), the pressure on Orban was becoming intense. He had one-on-one meetings with the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, increasingly an important figure in the EU’s power games. On Thursday morning, the final showdown: but not at the council, rather before it at a meeting with Macron, Meloni, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, the aforementioned Michel and commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. Waiting upstairs, the rest of the leaders, Varadkar among them, while the real business of the summit was being done in the room with Tricky Viki. Well, sure everyone was only delighted when the news came in: panic over. A sigh of relief in Kyiv. In comes Orban, claiming vindication. The truth was he caved in, though, and everyone knew it. But Leo and lads were entitled to wonder – we came all the way here for this? Oh, there was other work to be done, it’s true. Agreement on some budget changes – more money for keeping out illegal migrants and a few other things. There was a discussion about Gaza, in which Varadkar advocated reconsidering the EU’s trade agreements with Israel. A discussion about the unhappy farmers, who at that very moment appeared to be making a spirited attempt to set fire to the European Parliament (though to be honest, there’s more than a few of the leaders might have some sneaking sympathy with that objective). Afterwards, von der Leyen led a delegation to meet the farmers. Varadkar was home by teatime. Normally he loves summits. But this was just an anticlimax. Don’t worry; there’ll be another one soon. The rest of the leaders all skedaddled fairly lively, muttering. “They’re all pretty annoyed with Orban,” one official confessed. #billynomates",0,1
2024/2/2,"Varadkar seeks to downplay Coalition division on Dublin Airport’s future while backing expansion Remarks come after allies of Green Party transport minister Eamon Ryan object to increasing capacity at State’s main aviation hub  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has sought to play down divisions among the Coalition parties over the future of Dublin Airport as he backed proposals to increase its capacity. The airport’s operator DAA has applied to Fingal County Council for permission to increase capacity to 40 million passengers per year, up from the current 32 million allowed. The Irish Times reported on Friday that senior Green Party allies of Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan have objected to DAA’s plans. The position taken by some Green Party politicians prompted Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary to call for Mr Ryan’s resignation, accusing him of being an “incompetent” transport minister. Mr Varadkar defended Mr Ryan rejecting comments made by Mr O’Leary and said “this is a better Government because the Green Party is part of it”. He said the issue of the cap on passengers at Dublin Airport “is a planning matter ultimately and that will be decided by the relevant authorities.” Asked by reporters about his own view of the cap he said it is important that there is investment in Ireland’s regional airports. However, he added: “We shouldn’t forget that Dublin is the main gateway to Ireland. We’re an island nation. We need aviation and if we don’t raise the cap, we’ll be turning away people – tourists, visitors, business and driving up air fares and I don’t think that would be in our interest. “So I’d like to see it raised but it needs to be done in the right way. It needs to be done through the planning process.” Mr Varadkar was speaking at the turning of the sod of a new development of 300 affordable, cost rental and social homes at Mulhuddart in his Dublin West constituency. He was joined by Fianna Fáil Cabinet members – Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and junior transport minister Jack Chambers. Mr Chambers’ role includes international transport and he said he fully supports lifting the passenger cap. He said: “It’s absolutely essential for tourism, trade, employment and our wider industrial and economic policy.” Another local TD, Green Party Minister for Children and Integration Roderic O’Gorman, was also present at the event. He was among Green politicians who made objections to key strands of the proposal to expand capacity at Dublin Airport. Mr O’Gorman said his submission focused on aircraft noise and said that any review of the planning guidelines “has to look at the noise zones around Dublin Airport” and how impacted residents can be better compensated when it comes to noise insulation. He did not respond directly when asked if he opposes lifting the passenger cap or not, instead speaking about the need to develop regional airports. Mr Varadkar said it is “not an either or” situation when it comes to expanding Dublin Airport or investing in airports elsewhere. He said airlines like Aer Lingus and Ryanair “would say to us is that if you impose a cap on Dublin, while some flights might be redistributed to regional airports, other flights and direct routes would be lost to Ireland. “That would be not a good thing for the country in my view”. Mr Varadkar said there are “genuine concerns” around noise and flights happening at certain times. He added: “There has to be an obligation on the aviation industry to step up to the mark when it comes to moving towards aircrafts that are less noisy like the newer ones, and also moving towards the use of sustainable aviation fuels.” He sought to play down Coalition divisions saying: “I get the desire to make it you know, black versus white, or Government ministers being diametrically opposed on an issue. “It’s more complicated than that. We can all make our submissions ... but ultimately, there’s going to be a planning decision.” Asked if he was concerned that Green Party allies of Minister for Transport Mr Ryan were objecting to the increased capacity, he replied: “It’s not just Green Party people. “There are people from other parties too ... People are entitled to make observations and that includes Government ministers and I don’t have a problem with that.” When asked about submissions on the DAA plans from Green Party colleagues, Mr Ryan’s spokesman previously said he could not and would not intervene in the independent planning process in any way.",0,1
2024/2/20,"Ireland to back Ursula von der Leyen’s bid for second term  Sinn Fein calls for veto on President of the European Commission over her support for Israel The Government is likely to back European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s bid for a second term in the role, according to senior figures. Ms von der Leyen announced her intention to seek reappointment in Berlin yesterday in a move that was widely expected for some time. Government sources pointed to various uncertainties such as the outcome of the European Parliament elections and potential other candidates. They also said  the Irish Government disagreed with Ms von der Leyen’s strongly pro-Israel line since the conflict erupted in Gaza. But sources praised her record on Brexit, on climate action, on Covid and especially on Ukraine, where she has been a strong supporter of that country’s bid to become a candidate for membership of the EU, and of military support for Kyiv from EU countries. “It would be a foolish Government that would oppose her,” said one senior source. Another senior figure confirmed the expectation that Dublin would back Ms von der Leyen. But Sinn Féin called on the Government to say that it would not support a second term for von der Leyen, and foreign affairs spokesman Matt Carthy told The Irish Times that if Sinn Féin were in government, the party would veto her appointment. “In offering Netanyahu unconditional and unqualified support at a pivotal and escalating point in Israel’s onslaught against the civilian population of Gaza, Ursula von der Leyen provided political cover for the genocidal destruction that has unfolded in front of our eyes,” he said in a statement. “The Irish Government must clearly state that they will not support the reappointment of Ursula von der Leyen. So too should all candidates contesting the European elections, considering one of the first tasks of new MEPs will be to ratify the nomination for Commission president. “The Irish Government must also state that it will defend Ireland’s neutrality and our independent foreign policy against any efforts to undermine our ability to play a positive and constructive role in the world.” The Commission presidency is the single most powerful role in the EU, though the body shares power with the European Council and the group of heads of EU governments, and the appointment is made by the Council, subject to ratification by the European Parliament. In reality, the job tends to be part of a series of horse-trading between political blocs and countries over senior EU roles in the wake of the parliamentary elections, which are due in early June. Ms von der Leyen is expected to be the lead candidate of the EPP group of Christian democratic parties under the Sptzenkandidaten system – where the Commission presidency is supposed to be the prize for the party that returns the largest number of MEPs. However, EU leaders retain the right to appoint who they like. Five years ago, they overlooked the EPP’s lead candidate Manfred Weber to appoint von der Leyen at the suggestion of then German chancellor Angela Merkel.",0,1
2024/2/20,"Care amendment criticised by two more bodies in further blow to Yes Yes referendum campaign  Tánaiste disputes claim by Free Legal Advice Centres that ‘care’ amendment is sexist The campaign for a Yes vote to the Government’s proposed “care” amendment to the Constitution has suffered a further blow after two independent human rights bodies separately voiced concern about the proposal. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) and the Independent Living Movement Ireland (ILMI) outlined their positions on  Monday in the wake of criticism of the care amendment by the Free Legal Advice Centres (Flac). In referendums on March 8th, the Government proposes expanding the definition of family in Article 41 of the Constitution to recognise those based on “durable relationships”. The proposed care amendment involves replacing language in Article 41.2 around “duties” of women in the home with a new Article 42B providing that the State will “strive to” support care within families. In a statement on Monday following a legal analysis of the proposals, Flac supported the family amendment but described the care amendment as “ineffective”, “implicitly sexist” and potentially compromising of the rights of people with disabilities. Speaking to reporters in Brussels on Monday, Tánaiste Micheál Martin rejected Flac’s criticism of the care amendment. “I thought it was more of a political statement by Flac than a legal one, and I was taken aback by the suggestion that the proposed amendments were sexist,” he said. “I would take an opposite view to that, and I would reject the assertions by Flac.” There was “a degree of absurdity in labelling the amendments as sexist: they are not”, he said. The proposed changes “eliminate language that is archaic, in respect of the duties of women”, he said. In a statement  to The Irish Times, the ICCL confirmed that its position on the referendums remains as set out in a note issued previously to members by its executive director Liam Herrick. The  ICCL considered the care amendment “will not provide meaningful legal protection to any person who gives or receives care”, the statement said. However, it considered the “family” amendment will expand constitutional protection for families to include those not based on marriage and said that is “very welcome”, as is the proposal to delete Article 41.2 which “negatively stereotypes women”, it said. Article 41.2 provides the State shall “endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties within the home”. Based on its analysis, the ICCL said it will not be taking part in the referendum campaign but hoped it is “well informed, and that human rights and equality are given meaningful consideration during the debates”. In the lead-up to the referendums, it made submissions to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality and the Government’s Inter-Departmental Group, the ICCL  noted. The Government, it said, “should have gone further to implement the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly and Oireachtas Committee” which would have represented “a more legally impactful proposal”. Separately on Monday, in response to queries from The Irish Times, the  ILMI confirmed in a statement that it has withdrawn from the equality coalition, an alliance of civil society groups campaigning for equality, “as we are not in a position to endorse a YES YES campaign based on the realisation of disabled people’s rights and fully implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities”. The board of ILMI had on February 7th last unanimously voted it has “no position as an organisation” on the forthcoming referendums and it reiterates that position, the statement said. It encouraged disabled people to register and exercise their right to vote, describing the referendums as “deeply personal matters to each individual”. Working with other organisations in the equality coalition before the referendum wordings issued, the ILMI had built a shared understanding of the term “care” to mean a “system that empowers disabled people, older people, and anyone who needs support to live and be included in their communities”, it said. This was “consistent with the Citizens’ Assembly on Care and recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee”. After the wording of the care referendum “fell short” of what the  ILMI and other equality organisations were calling for, the equality coalition lobbied politicians for amendments “to reflect our values about the supports people need, including disabled people, to live and be included in their communities”. Despite much political support, no amendments were accepted, it said.",0,1
2024/2/20,"Sinn Féin promises to re-run referendums on care and family if they fail, should it be returned to government Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman says proposal places obligation on State to strive to support care  Sinn Féin has promised to re-run referendums on care and family if they fail, should it be returned to Government after the next General Election. Speaking at the launch of the party’s campaign for a Yes-Yes vote in the referendums to be held on March 8th, Ms McDonald sharply criticised the wording proposed by the Government, and the timing of the referendum – while urging a dual Yes vote. “Should this fail, the question we would put would be the wording as per the Citizens’ Assembly.” “We would return to the Citizens’ Assembly ... That’s what should be happening now. And if this is not successful, that’s where we would bring that,” she said. The Dublin Central TD said it would be her ambition to do so early in the term of any Government Sinn Féin took part in. She said that the removal of sexist language from the Constitution was “of course” a good thing but that Sinn Féin “did have to have a fairly detailed consideration of this”. She said the Government had in haste failed to consult properly and adopt the work that had been done by the Citizens’ Assembly, and that she had spoken to carers who were supportive but also those who viewed the referendum on care as mere “lip service”. “On the one hand, it represents a step forward, but on the other hand, it’s not the comprehensive, copper-fastened recognition of care, vindicating the rights of caring, carers, inside the home and beyond.” On a recent sustained slide in polling numbers, Ms McDonald said she was “never happy” about a dip in support but that she wouldn’t “brood” over it. “It’s now been four years since anybody went to the polls. That’s a long time to sustain a narrative of change and energy behind that,” she said, pledging to do anything she can as party leader to “re-energise the message of change”. On the controversy over exit payments to RTÉ executives, Ms McDonald said that for senior people in the broadcaster, “accountability comes very slowly but at all”, saying there was a sharp contrast between their treatment and those who had not paid their TV licence fee and now faced being hauled before the courts. Amid criticism of RTÉ Director General Kevin Bakhurst, Ms McDonald said she was supportive of his stated intention to reform the broadcaster but criticised delays in providing information about exit payouts for senior executives. She said she supported him on the presumption he would move forward with a change agenda. Meanwhile, campaign for a Yes-Yes vote in the upcoming referendums has not been damaged by criticism of the proposed wording of the “care” amendment from leading civil society groups, advocates say. Speaking in Dublin on Tuesday, Catherine Cox, head of policy with Family Carers Ireland, said the campaign had not been damaged by contributions from the Free Legal Aid Centre (Flac), the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) and the Independent Living Movement Ireland (ILMI). “I don’t think it does, I think it’s a healthy debate ... it’s the first time that care has been discussed across the nation, it’s a healthy discussion,” she said. In referendums to take place on March 8th, the Government proposes expanding the definition of family in the Constitution to recognise “durable relationships”, such as cohabiting couples and their children, and replacing the language around “women in the home” with language recognising care within families. Flac has said the language proposed for insertion into the Constitution should the “care” referendum be carried is “ineffective” and “implicitly sexist”. The ICCL said the proposed amendment “will not provide meaningful legal protection” to those who give or receive care. The ILMI confirmed it had withdrawn from the equality Coalition, an alliance of civil society groups, as it was “not in a position to endorse” a Yes-Yes vote based on “the realisation of disabled people’s rights and fully implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities”. Asked about the criticisms on Tuesday, Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman said the care amendment “clearly places a new legal obligation on the State, on this Government and future governments, to strive to support care”. Asked if he was concerned that the views of these groups could negatively impact the campaign for Yes votes, the Minister said there was “a very strong body of political and NGO support for two Yes votes”. Speaking in Dublin on Tuesday at the launch of the Family Carers Ireland and National Women’s Council of Ireland campaign for a Yes-Yes vote, Ms Cox said: “Flac described the new language as sexist, how can they say that looking at the language that is in there already which speaks about a woman’s duties in the home?” Shelley Gaynor, who has a disability and is a member of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission’s disability advisory committee, said Flac’s contribution was “disappointing” and that the proposed wording was a “good start”. In a statement, Flac said its position was based on detailed human rights and legal analysis and “derived from our long-standing experience litigating on behalf of people who experience discrimination and disadvantage – including cases involving social and economic rights”. “We asserted specifically and repeatedly in yesterday’s statement that the current so-called ‘women in the home’ provision is explicitly sexist and offensive. We are fully in favour of its deletion but not of the insertion of Article 42B,” it said. Tánaiste Micheál Martin had said there was “a degree of absurdity” in Flac “labelling the amendments as sexist: they are not”. In its statement, Flac said the proposed amendment gives constitutional expression to the idea that care is the private responsibility of unpaid family members, mostly women.  “We do not accept that it is absurd to describe this as ‘implicitly sexist’,” it said.  Meanwhile, a newly founded group of carers and people with disabilities, Equality Not Care, will launch its campaign seeking a No vote in the care referendum on Wednesday.",0,1
2024/2/20,"Shared Island initiative: Casement Park and A5 upgrade among projects in line for €1bn State funding Commitments include hourly Dublin-Belfast train service and represents ‘investing in people, in quality of life, in opportunity’ The Government has said it will commit €1 billion in funding to projects in Northern Ireland as part of the Shared Island initiative including €50 million towards the redevelopment of Casement Park in Belfast as well as recommitting €600 million to the long-delayed A5 road linking Monaghan to Derry. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Micheál Martin and Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan announced the funding commitments following the measures being approved by Cabinet at its meeting on Tuesday. Mr Varadkar said that it was the largest ever investment for cross-Border initiatives and also said that it would benefit the north of Ireland, people on both sides of the Border, as well as the all-island economy. At a joint press conference in Government Buildings, he said the funding would benefit both jurisdictions and all communities. “It is about understanding that, whatever the constitutional future of Ireland brings, investing in people, in quality of life, in opportunity, and for the generations to come, are all of our responsibilities and a common good we can best progress by working together.” The €50 million investment for Casement Park is a contribution to develop the stadium in time for the EUFA Euro 2028 soccer tournament, which is being jointly hosted by Ireland and the UK. The stadium, which as the principal GAA stadium in Belfast, has lain derelict for over a decade. The projected estimate of redevelopment has been put at as much as €200 million. Mr Varadkar said the stadium would be made available for soccer but said he also hoped that the GAA would make it available for a wide range of sporting and cultural events once it has been reestablished. The €600 million earmarked for A5 is a recommittal of the sum committed by a previous Dublin government almost two decades ago. The commitment was reduced to €80 million in 2011 during the economic downturn. “We are in a good place financially and able to increase and restore our commitment to the A5,” said Mr Varadkar. “The Irish economy is very strong and that (might not be) the case in the UK,” he said. “It might look different in five years time and ten years time. We need to think about the real long term investments that we need to make,” he said. Mr Ryan said it was not possible to estimate the overall cost of the A5 project as there were still some planning issues to be finalised on the road network (which has, over the years, seen countless delays over planning disputes and funding issues). However, he confirmed that the Government’s commitment to the funding was total. He said that work would also be done on improving the N2 road in Co Monaghan and strategic road corridors in Donegal, some of which will link to the A5. The overall plan also provides for the introduction of an hourly rail service on the Dublin-Belfast line during peak hours. That change will double the current frequency. Mr Ryan said it would improve sustainable transport connectivity between the two largest cities on the island and be a catalyst for economic and social connections. Mr Martin said the Narrow Water Bridge project, which links the Cooley Peninsula to Co Down, was already in train and constituted a massive investment by the Irish Government. “It is unlocking an entirely new tourism project and is also a strong connectivity project,” he said. Mr Martin said the concept underlying the project was partnership between both jurisdictions and about the benefits brought by a shared island. “We agreed from the time of the Good Friday Agreement that we would share the tourism project. It’s about getting them on the island and then travelling to [both sides of the Border],” he said.",0,1
2024/2/21,"Long-awaited A5 road upgrade to get €600m in funding as part of Shared Island initiative Taoiseach also commits €50m to redevelopment of Casement Park in Belfast Rebuilding one of the most dangerous roads in Ireland will take the lion’s share of an €800 million Government funding package for cross-Border projects which was unveiled on Tuesday. The long-stalled A5 upgrade between Derry and Aughnacloy in Co Tyrone – it was approved by the Stormont Executive 17 years ago – is to receive €600 million from the Shared Island initiative and comes in the wake of a high-profile campaign by families who have lost loved ones to the treacherous stretch. There have been more than 50 fatalities on the road since 2006, with 10 dying in one year alone. Construction work on the new road, which is part of the main route between Dublin and the northwest, is expected to begin later this year. A €50 million commitment was also given by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to the redevelopment of Casement Park GAA stadium in west Belfast in advance of it being chosen as a venue for the Euro 2028 football tournament, while further funding was guaranteed for the Narrow Water bridge project linking the Co Down town of Warrenpoint with the Co Louth village of Omeath in what will be a significant tourist boost for the wider area. Plans for a new hourly rail service between Belfast and Dublin were confirmed with a €12.5 million investment, a move that will replace the existing staggered service that has run for decades between the two cities. Announcing the allocations, Mr Varadkar said it was “the largest ever package of Government funding for cross-Border initiatives” and singled out the recent restoration of Stormont powersharing as a development that has “brought renewed hope”. While the majority of the Stormont parties broadly welcomed the funding, in particular the A5 commitment, political tensions quickly resurfaced over the Casement Park project. DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said it was “not the job or the responsibility of the Republic’s Government to provide financial support for the provision of public services and general Northern Ireland infrastructure”. “That is a matter for the UK government and must be done so in accordance with our needs base as set out in evidence provided to the UK government,” he added. “We reiterate our position that whilst the Irish Government have made a commitment to provide an allocation of their resource to the construction of the Casement Park project, this does not deal with the substantive funding gap that exists as a result of the massive increase in costs over the period. “It is right that the GAA receives its allocation from the Northern Ireland Executive as previously agreed and in line with the allocations to the three supporting bodies but we cannot see how significant additional UK taxpayer resources will be available at a time when other vital public services are in need of additional resource and capital allocations.” During an earlier Westminster scrutiny committee on Tuesday, DUP MP Jim Shannon claimed that the estimated cost to rebuild Casement had soared to £220 million (€188 million) – the original estimate was £77 million – and questioned Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris on whether the UK government could meet the huge shortfall as Stormont and the GAA could not afford to cover the bill. Mr Heaton-Harris would not be drawn however on projected costs or London’s future funding of the new 34,000 capacity Belfast stadium despite insisting last year that the money would be found to ensure Casement would be ready in time to host the Euro matches. “I’m very wary... that contractors when bidding for a contract like Casement Park might choose to think that the taxpayers’ largesse is infinite in this space and I want to make sure it is completely understood that while I’m sure there will be a decent taxpayer contribution, it’s got to be done on a value-for-money basis... if something becomes way too expensive then things have to change,” Mr Heaton-Harris told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. However, newly appointed Stormont Minister for Finance, Caoimhe Archibald, said Stormont was committed to Casement’s redevelopment, describing it as “an Executive flagship project”. “It will be built,” she told reporters on Tuesday. “We’ve had a lot of talk about what the cost might be, but I think the benefits that it is going to bring to the economy of the North from a tourism potential, but also in terms of getting young people involved in sport and the legacy benefits that are going to roll out for years to come, is something I think that we can all get behind.”",0,1
2024/2/21,"RTÉ in a ‘straitjacket’ by agreeing to confidential exit payment clauses, says Minister for Finance Michael McGrath said that Government demanded and expected transparency from RTÉ  Minister for Finance Michael McGrath has questioned why RTÉ put itself into a “straitjacket” by agreeing confidential exit payments with two senior executives who have left the broadcaster over the past year. RTÉ said on Wednesday that it has received updated legal advice regarding the publication of details of exit packages. However, it is not yet ready to share the position outlined by the advice publicly. A spokesman said this is now being considered by the broadcaster. He also said that the broadcaster was waiting to receive one more piece of legal advice. But in the strongest criticism from a senior Government figure of the undisclosed payments to former head of strategy Rory Coveney, and to former director of finance Richard Collins – payments that not generally known to the public until recent days – Mr McGrath said that an organisation such as the RTÉ which was in the eye of a storm should realise it needed to be transparent. “My own view is that confidentiality in the case of a public body that is partly dependent on taxpayer support should really be done only in exceptional circumstances,” he said. “It certainly should not be the norm, particularly when an organisation is in a maelstrom and where there should be a recognition that transparency is demanded and expected by the Minister, by the Government and by Oireachtas committees as well.” In recent days, RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst has argued that such confidential agreements are standard for senior executives departing organisations and that elected officials were essentially asking him to break the law by disclosing the value of the payments. Mr Bakhurst sought legal advice in recent days to see how far he could to disclose information on the payments without breaching any law. Mr McGrath said that nobody was asking anybody to break the law but added: “When you enter into such an agreement, you are putting yourself into a straitjacket in many respects. “The Government values transparency and it is an essential part of the recovery of the reputation of RTÉ in my mind. So, one questions why the organisation put itself into that straitjacket in relation to some of the individual cases concerned? “In general, for any body that is dependent in part on public funding, such grievances in life should be kept to an absolute minimum and only used in exceptional circumstances,” he said. Mr McGrath was speaking at the Department of Finance during the launch of the annual report on public debt. Asked for his view if the Revenue Commissioners should have a role in collecting the charge for public service media in the future, Mr McGrath said the Revenue Commissioners were “policy takers” and would fulfil any obligations the Government imposed in relation to political decisions. He said the Government could engage with the Commissioners to understand its perspective on any decision. “We are not at that point yet. We need to await a Government decision on the nature of the future funding of RTÉ.” He said RTÉ's financial position had been stabilised by the injection of €60 million in funding in addition to a further €40 million. He also said that payment of the licence fee by householders had returned to normal levels. The number of households paying dipped after the controversy over secret payments to broadcaster Ryan Tubridy were first made public.",0,1
2024/2/21,"Von der Leyen’s Israel visit unlikely to deter Ireland from supporting second term – McGrath European Commission president pledged unequivocal support for Israel in comments criticised in ireland The Government would not view a visit by Ursula von der Leyen to Israel in the wake of October 7th as a reason not to support her bid for a second term in the office, Minister for Finance Michael McGrath has said. Ms von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, unequivocally pledged EU support for Israel’s right to defend itself during the visit and has not, over the past five months, criticised the large-scale onslaught by Israel on Gaza. She is running for a second term as president towards the end of 2024, seeking nomination from national leaders in the European Council before election by the European Parliament.  Opposition parties, including Sinn Féin, have issued statements saying they oppose the reappointment of the German politicians because of her unwavering and continuing support for Israel. The Government has yet to make a decision on what position it will adopt.. But speaking at a launch in the Department of Finance on Wednesday, Mr McGrath gave an indication that the Government is unlikely to oppose her nomination. “As a Government we haven’t discussed a candidacy for a second term in the European Commission so I don’t want to pre-empt discussion,” said Mr McGrath. Referring to her contentious visit to Israel the week after the Hamas massacre, Mr McGrath said the Irish Government and other member States had responded to it appropriately at the time. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in the Dáil later in October that he had told Ms von der Leyen at the EU Summit in Brussels her comments had “lacked balance”. Yesterday Mr McGrath said the position of the European Union since then, as a collective, had evolved and was now closer to the position adopted by Ireland and by several other EU countries, all of which have condemned the indiscriminate killing of civilians. Almost 30,000 have now been killed in Gaza. “Ireland has been quite consistent from the very beginning. (The State’s) position has moved more centre-stage in terms of the thinking across the European Union,” he said. Separately, Mr McGrath also said that Ireland still had a chance to win a competition that would see the headquarters of the new EU Anti-Money Laundering Authority located here. Ireland is one of nine Member States that has bid to be the location of the new agency. The outcome of the process (which involves votes by the EU Council and by the EU Parliament) will be known on Thursday. The proposed new Authority aims to improve the detection of suspicious financial transactions and close loopholes used by criminals to launder illicit proceeds or finance terrorist activities. Mr McGrath said that senior Cabinet Ministers, officials, and diplomats have continued to lobby the decision-makers heavily. “We are giving it our best shot. We are really competitive,” said Mr McGrath. “Yes, we do have a chance. But we’re up against large Member States that have a lot of influence and a lot of power.” It is understood that Ireland’s application puts significant emphasis on the geographical spread of EU institutions and the relative lack of headquarters here in Ireland compared to other countries.",0,1
2024/2/21,"Omagh bombing inquiries on both sides of Border would not ‘make sense’, says Tánaiste  Northern Secretary announces terms of reference for UK inquiry and calls on Dublin to follow suit The Tánaiste has said it does not make sense to have inquiries into the Omagh bombing on both sides of the Border. Micheál Martin, also Minister for Foreign Affairs, was speaking after Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris announced the terms of reference for a statutory inquiry into the atrocity and suggested the Irish Government should set up its own. “In our view, one inquiry is optimal, two separate inquiries to me doesn’t make sense because there would be clear overlap and duplication and maybe crossing each other,” said Mr Martin  during a visit to Belfast on Wednesday. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, died as a result of the car bombing on August 15th, 1998. The independent inquiry to be established by the UK government will focus on key issues identified in a Belfast High Court judgment that ruled it was potentially plausible that the attack by the Real IRA could have been prevented. The inquiry is to be chaired by a former senior judge, Lord Turnbull, and will have the power to compel the production of documents and to summon witnesses to give evidence on oath. The inquiry will examine the adequacy of the measures taken by UK state authorities, including the police, security forces and intelligence and security agencies, to disrupt dissident republicans who had been involved in attacks from December 1997 up to and including the Omagh bombing. It will assess whether that approach changed following the Belfast Agreement of April 1998. It will also examine alleged intelligence-sharing failures between the UK and Irish authorities in the year and a half leading up to the bombing. It will further test an allegation made by a former senior police officer, Norman Baxter, that detectives investigating previous dissident attacks were not given access to full intelligence information on suspects. It will also examine claims around information allegedly passed to the security forces by a state agent known as Kevin Fulton in the months prior to the Omagh attack. In his 2021 judgment in Belfast High Court, Mr Justice Horner directly recommended that the UK government carry out an investigation into alleged security failings in the lead-up to the bombing. While having no jurisdiction to order the Irish Government to act on the matter, the judge also urged authorities in the South to establish their own inquiry in light of his findings. Mr Heaton-Harris said the Omagh bombing was “a cruel atrocity carried out, not just on the people of Omagh, but on all those in Northern Ireland who supported the peace process”. He added: “I urge the Irish Government to now explain what consideration it has given to the setting up of an investigation in Ireland to discharge its obligations under article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in line with the clear direction of the High Court.” Mr Martin on Wednesday rejected the suggestion that the Government had not done enough to pursue those responsible for Troubles era crimes. “There is no amnesty in the Republic and there never has been an amnesty given in the Republic,” he said, adding that people were convicted in the State and imprisoned in relation to the Omagh bombing. “The gardaí and the Director of Public Prosecutions are independent of government. No direction has ever been given to either not to pursue cases that arose from the Troubles and not to prosecute, those are the facts.” The Government, he said, had “made it very clear that we would be fully co-operative” with any inquiry into the Omagh bombing. “We have mechanisms, we have changed the law in the Republic on a number of occasions to facilitate the provision of information that the Republic may have in respect of certain crimes,” he said. “Our view is we’ll see the terms of reference and then we’ll work to ensure that we contribute to that inquiry.” – PA",0,1
2024/2/21,"Russian ambassador says Tánaiste’s assertion Moscow killed Navalny is ‘unconscionable’ Yuri Filatov says any attempt to put the blame on the Russian authorities is ‘politically-motivated speculation’ Russian ambassador Yuri Filatov has rejected as “unconscionable” an assertion by Tánaiste Micheál Martin that there is “no question” but that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed by Moscow. Mr Filatov was summoned to the Department of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday to address the alleged extrajudicial killing of Mr Navalny. The Russian embassy has said any attempt to put the blame on the Russian authorities is an intolerable interference in the internal affairs of Russia. “There is no question in my mind that this kind of accusation is unacceptable and wrong, at least until all the facts related to the matter – the demise of Navalny – are determined by the proper investigation,” Mr Filatov told Drivetime presenter Cormac Ó hEadhra on Wednesday. “It is clear that every loss of life is regrettable, and this one is not an exception. But it would seem to me that at least we should wait until the facts are on the table to make any conclusions.” When it was put to Mr Filatov that Mr Navalny’s incarceration in a penal colony within the Arctic Circle – one of the country’s harshest prisons – may have contributed to his death, he said that was “hearsay”, adding: “Whether or not that contributed is up to the medics to see.” He continued: “What is going on at the moment is wanton and nonsensical allegations by the western political elite. It is politically-motivated speculation with a clear intent to exploit is for the purposes of attacking Russia, and that is unacceptable and unconscionable.” Questioned on whether Moscow would permit an independent investigation into the death of Mr Navalny, he said: “I don’t have the slightest doubt in my mind that the procedures and investigations are impartial according to the law. This presupposes that the current investigation is not somehow impartial, which I reject of course. We have no interest in a cover-up. “I simply never engage in conspiracy theories, which you seem to be doing. What I am doing is telling you the state of affairs as they are.” As to whether he could guarantee the safety of other Russian dissidents, Mr Filatov said: “Again the premise of your question is outrageous and I completely reject it. How can I address your question? Is it paranoia? I cannot comment on provocative and paranoid questions like that.” The US will announce a major package of sanctions against Russia on Friday over the death of Mr Navalny and the two-year Ukraine war, US president Joe Biden said on Tuesday. Mr Filatov said the move would not have the desired effect on Russia, and rejected the suggestion it has become a pariah state. “They have already shown that the net result is close to nil. This is a mistaken policy that will not bring the desired results. As far as pariah goes, in your view that may be the case but you are not the world population. The majority support our view.”",0,1
2024/2/22,"Infrastructure projects ‘take far too long’ to complete, says Varadkar Taoiseach says Government will allocated extra money from windfall taxes for ‘shovel-ready’ projects Infrastructure projects “take far too long” to complete, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar who says he shares the frustrations of the public about persistent delays. Mr Varadkar told the Dublin Chamber of Commerce annual dinner that the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe is now providing quarterly reports to Government on the progress of public capital projects. He said the Government will allocate extra money from windfall taxes for “shovel-ready” projects over the next three years. Those are projects that have been through the planning process and are ready to go. “For the longer term, we are investing some of our surplus revenues into two new funds for future generations. We will be the Government to break the cycle of stop-start capital investment.” Mr Varadkar spoke to 600 guests at the annual event chamber event. After a slow start, the Land Development Agency is starting to build houses, he said, and 500 affordable homes will be announced for Fingal in the coming weeks, he stated. He referred to the riots last November and the need for people to feel safer on the streets of Dublin and announced that there will be a summit on the issue in the coming weeks. Addressing the subject of labour shortages, he said the Government has now announced the biggest ever expansion of the employment permits system by adding 43 occupations – from engineers, mechanics and electricians, to social care workers, butchers and bakers. The Government was equally mindful of the cost of doing business especially for small businesses, he maintained. “Of course, I understand that smaller businesses in some sectors are struggling to absorb these costs. They all came together at much the same time. We are responding with extra financial grants to ease the burden and examining what more we can do to ensure viable but vulnerable businesses survive. “We did not spend billions of euros during the pandemic to keep businesses open to see them close now.” In her first address as Chamber president, Siobhán O’Shea criticised the Government for imposing restrictions on the number of homes that can be built in the Greater Dublin Area. “We do not accept that Government should seek to limit the development of housing in the many towns and suburbs of the city that make up its hinterland, particularly where these towns are well served by public transport,” she told chamber members. “Public transport is indeed a key enabler for the city to function. It is one of the basics – an essential element in any city’s infrastructure. The density and population growth in the Dublin region suggest to us that the returns vastly outweigh the costs, and that projects such as Metrolink, Bus Connects and Dart Plus can lead the way in Ireland’s drive to meet its carbon emission targets.” Ms O’Shea also criticised proposals to limit the number of passengers using Dublin Airport. Access to Dublin Port and Dublin Airport should be allowed to continue “without unnecessary and artificial constraints”. She said Dublin Chamber will support the idea of a directly elected mayor for the city. If a referendum on the proposal is defeated, she suggested that Dublin should have a minister at Cabinet.",0,1
2024/2/22,"Ireland spends €8.5m on Israeli surveillance drones and military equipment  Much of the money has gone to Aeronautics Defence Industries which is owned by the Israeli state and manufactures lethal drones used in Gaza The Department of Defence has paid at least €8.5 million to Israeli arms manufacturers for military drones and other equipment in the past decade. The money has been spent on unnamed aerial vehicles, advanced targeting equipment, ground radar systems, communications systems, maintenance and training. About half of this money has been paid to Aeronautics Defence Industries, whose unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played a central role in Israel’s ongoing assault of Gaza. Aeronautics Defence Industries is owned by the Israeli government through its parent company, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The Irish Defence Forces operates a number of Aeronautics Defence Industries “Orbiter” drones, after first signing a contract with the company in 2007. The remainder of the expenditure was spent on equipment, training and parts from Elbit Systems, which has its headquarters in Haifa, Israel and also manufactures lethal drones and ordnance which have been used in Gaza. Ireland is campaigning for the EU to review its trade agreements with Israel in light of concerns about breaches of the deal’s human rights clauses during the assault on Gaza. Opposition TDs have now called on the Government to end its financial relationships with Israeli arms companies in light of the assault on Gaza. While both Elbit and Aeronautics Defence Industries manufacture lethal drones, the Defence Forces employs only non-lethal versions of the devices. These are chiefly used by the Army for reconnaissance, surveillance and artillery spotting. The Army also uses Elbit ground radar systems and “target acquisition” technology to detect and fire on potential adversaries. According to procurement data from the Department of Defence, it has paid €4,503,444, excluding VAT, to Aeronautics Defence Industries since 2014. The real figure is likely to be significantly higher as the data details payments only above €20,000. It also excludes payments which may be classified for security reasons. The same data details €2.6 million in payments to Elbit during the decade. However, figures released to People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy late last year states that more than €4 million has been paid to Elbit and its subsidiaries in the past five years. Both companies have been involved in controversy in recent years. Various financial institutions and state pension funds have divested from Elbit, citing human rights concerns, including the company’s manufacture of cluster bombs. This includes the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), the State’s sovereign wealth fund, which is banned from investing in Elbit along with several other defence firms. In 2017 the Israeli defence ministry suspended the export licence for Aeronautics Defence Industries’ Orbiter 1K drone. This came after reports the company had used one of its “kamikaze” drones to attack the Armenian military while demonstrating its capability to Azerbaijani forces. Sinn Féin’s spokesman on foreign affairs and defence, Matt Carty, said Ireland should not engage with Israeli arms companies “and the Department of Defence should not be procuring goods or services from Israeli-based companies until that state demonstrates its commitment to international law”. Mr Murphy said it was “shocking” that almost €9 million of Irish public money had been spent on drones and other equipment from Israeli armaments companies. “Drones manufactured by these companies are terrorising Palestinian children right now. Not a cent of public money should be going to the Israeli arms industry,” the People Before Profit TD said. “We need a commitment from the Government that Israeli armaments companies will be excluded from any future public tenders and an immediate end to any ongoing agreements with Israeli armaments companies.” The Defence Forces have a long history of using Israeli military equipment, including purchasing ammunition from Israeli Military Industries in 2005 and entering into a €2.5 million contract for helmets with another company in 2006.",0,1
2024/2/22,"RTÉ may be brought within remit of Comptroller and Auditor General Varadkar tells Fine Gael move would allow RTÉ finances to be scrutinised by Public Accounts Committee The Government is considering bringing RTÉ within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General which would mean that all of the broadcaster’s spending could be scrutinised by the Dáil’s spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told the Fine Gael parliamentary party on Thursday that such a move is being considered by the Government in the wake of the serious issues that have arisen over secret payments, the €2.3 million losses of Toy Show the Musical and the generous exit packages paid to senior executives leaving the broadcaster. The PAC received a special dispensation from the Committee on Privileges and Oversight to examine the broadcaster’s use of public finances. The remit expired at Christmas and it has now sought a time extension. However, as the Taoiseach outlined to the meeting of his party colleagues on Wednesday night, chaired by Alan Dillon, the Government will now consider formally extending the mandate of the PAC to scrutinise the broadcaster’s use of its finances. It comes after RTÉ director general Kevin Bakhurst disclosed on Thursday evening legal advice he had received on whether or not he could make public the amount that RTÉ agreed to pay to former executives Rory Coveney and Richard Collins under exit deals struck when they were leaving their employment there. Neither RTÉ nor the media have commented on the advice. However, RTÉ News has reported that the legal advice has made it clear that the confidentiality clauses associated with the payments cannot be broken, without court action being taken. It has also reported that there may be some scope to disclose the overall figure paid to all executives who have left the broadcaster in recent years, without breaking it down for individuals. However, this might also be possible to ascertain by scrutinising RTÉ's annual accounts. RTÉ has been contacted for comment on the contents of the legal advice. The broadcaster has been under pressure from Government Ministers and Oireachtas committees to disclose the amounts paid. It was reported last weekend that Mr Coveney, the former director of strategy, received a package worth €200,000 but RTÉ has not confirmed any figure. On Wednesday, Minister for Finance Michael McGrath, in an implicit criticism of Mr Bakhurst, said RTÉ had put itself in a “straitjacket” by agreeing to the confidentiality clauses.",0,1
2024/2/22,"Leo Varadkar unsure Citizens’ Assembly wording on carers stronger than proposed amendment March 8th referendum proposes State ‘shall strive to support’ the provision of care  Leo Varadkar has said he is unsure that the wording on care proposed by the Citizens’ Assembly is stronger than the care amendment that will be put to the public in a referendum. There are two referendums being held on March 8th that propose changing the Constitution. The second, the care amendment, proposes deleting Article 41.2.1 and 41.2.2, which make reference to a woman’s life and “duties in the home”, and insert a new article that acknowledges family carers. The Citizens’ Assembly on Gender Equality recommended to replace the wording with language that was not gender specific and “obliges the State to take reasonable measures to support care within the home and wider community”. The wording being put to people in the referendum says the State “shall strive to support” the provision of care by family members to one another. Asked about the chosen wording, the Taoiseach said that “there is a different language that some people preferred”. “And that was the State would take ‘reasonable measures’, but what’s reasonable? Is that actually stronger? I’m not even entirely sure it is,” Mr Varadkar said. “One thing a government always has to do is make decisions and make difficult choices. So, I was there 12-13 years ago when we weren’t talking about more resources for anything. We were talking about cutbacks. And governments always have to make difficult decisions. “So, if you put in language, say, which was really, really, really strong around care, but you don’t have any language in about cancer treatment, then you’ve a problem. “So, you have to leave some discretion to the people you elect to decide how resources are allocated, how the money is spent, because if you put everything in the Constitution, it’s actually the courts who will decide, not the people who you elect, and that’s not a good idea.” The Taoiseach said there had been “scaremongering” on the wording of the other referendum, which proposes extending the definition of family beyond those based on marriage and to those based on “durable” relationships. “‘Durable’ is not a word we’ve looked at in the dictionary,” Mr Varadkar said. “It’s there already in law in the cohabiting legislation from 2010 and it’s also already there in European law. “So, a durable relationship is one that’s caring, it’s committed, it’s there to last. You can’t just accidentally find yourself in one and the kind of things we have in mind again will be a one-parent family, cohabitees, a family led by a grandparent or guardian. “In a lot of ways these things are actually in our law already. So, people in receipt of the one-parent family payments, that’s under social welfare law, cohabitants have certain responsibilities to each other, that’s in law from 2010. What this does in many ways is constitutional catch-up.” He added: “We did think long and hard about the wording. And, you know, that’s one of the reasons why it took so long to come to this. “We got legal advice, we got the Irish translators in the room during the meetings, because it’s the Irish version that actually has precedence in law. “So, we put a lot of thought into the wording and durable, again, it’s not a word that’s in the Constitution at the moment, but is already there in the law and in European law, and has a lot of case law around it as well.” – PA",0,1
2024/2/25,"O’Gorman will ‘continue to engage and explore’ possibility of dual use for D Hotel in Drogheda Spokesman for hotel said earlier in week dual use of facility was not possible for child protection reasons Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman will “continue to engage and explore” the possibility of dual use of the D Hotel in Drogheda, Co Louth despite the hotel saying this week it would not be possible due to “child protection issues”. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Wednesday the Government wants the hotel to have a “dual use”, so that the facility can accommodate both asylum seekers and tourists and this would be “the best outcome” for the town. A spokesman for the hotel subsequently said that dual use of the hotel was not possible for child protection reasons. Mr O’Gorman met local business leaders and councillors from the area this week. “He [Minister O’Gorman] will continue to engage and explore the possibility of dual use,” a spokesman for the Minister said on Sunday. The D Hotel said on Sunday it had no comment to make. It is understood the hotel had also been used by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) for medical students working on placements at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda until last October. “RCSI arranges accommodation for students who are undergoing placements in healthcare settings at a distance around the country,” an RCSI spokeswoman said. “Some locations are accessible on a daily basis as a reasonable commute, such as Drogheda. Accommodation regularly comes on and off availability. “We would also make changes to our accommodation arrangements depending on the volume of students attending rotations. Our students continue to attend their rotations in Drogheda as normal.” Labour TD Ged Nash said the “defence” that dual use cannot be achieved because of child protection concerns was not sustainable and “it does not stand up to the thinnest of scrutiny”. “In my view, these comments are a direct and explicit challenge made by the company to the authority of the Taoiseach,” he said. “The Taoiseach admitted in the Dáil that Ukrainian families are accommodated alongside tourists in hotels.” The Louth TD affirmed that no child protection concerns arise and “the D Hotel needs to be reminded of this fact of life by Government and departmental officials”. “The question is – why should an exception be made for this hotel,” he added. “This dismissive attitude has not gone down well with the people of the town.” It emerged earlier this month that the D Hotel will be converted into an accommodation centre for up to 500 international protection (IP) applicants from March 5th. In a statement released by the owners of the hotel – referred to as Fairkeep Ltd – they confirmed they had “entered into an agreement” with the Department of Integration for the housing of IP applicants for the next two years. The D Hotel is Drogheda’s largest hotel, with 113 beds.",0,1

Here’s what poll respondents said  Irish Times/Ipsos B&A Snapshot poll asked what in Ireland was going in the right direction or the wrong direction As part of the latest Irish Times/Ipsos B&A Snapshot poll, respondents were asked to comment on what in Ireland was going in the right direction or the wrong direction. Below is a selection of answers. “Some of the stuff they are addressing on climate change is good. The referendum is good but not happy with the wording. The management of economy is good – right direction.” “Putting the cyclists over everyone else, city centre only cyclists and public transport. Not everyone can avail of these.” “The Greens are making a balls of the country, in that they are putting ramps everywhere and putting wide footpaths everywhere so that we have to rev our cars every 100 yards. Paint white lines properly and advise people to wear high-viz jackets.” “The bottle refund scheme is not going to work as people would be too lazy to do it and the bottle banks are free. Affordable housing is not available to everyone there is so much red tape.” “Wrong direction – the recycling of the bottles is a farce and a disaster.” “The Government are going in the right direction with their financial help given towards electricity bills and their changes to the tax bands were very positive. The situation with the health service is a sign of the Government going in the wrong direction.” “Wrong direction: the cost of living is going up rather that going down. It is hard to get an appointment at the hospital. But overall the country is going in the right direction.” “Wrong direction: they are doing nothing about the cost of living, they are focusing too much on this green energy. Electric vehicles will not work in this country and they don’t realise it. The influx of refugees has gone out of control, this country has been used as a sponge.” “Wrong direction – the country is being terrorised by all those undocumented people coming into country.” “Leo Varadkar saying they have no control over the borders. There is a housing crisis in Cork. I’ve given up my car to afford rent. The system is there to be taken advantage of.” “I have nothing against foreigners but I think there are too many and there is only so much a country can do.” “Housing wrong direction, too much commercial property empty and not enough houses.” “Government let us down badly. Housing crisis – that’s why my kids are moving away. They’re totally disconnecting with the real world.” “The Government have done nothing for people like myself who live in homeless accommodation with three kids, the youngest of which is nine months old.” “I suppose, coming out of the Budget, the country does seem to be doing okay financially. Some of the additional social welfare payments that were given out, as a positive example. Gov plan heading in the right direction.” “Unemployment is relatively low, which is positive, and the contributions for vulnerable people have increased, which is a positive. Overall, compared to other countries, Ireland is a better state.” “Right direction: salary rise. They have increased the minimum wage. It’s going in the right direction.” “Wrong direction: the Government doesn’t seem to helping anybody.” “The last budget was excellent for older people. It’s going in the right direction.” “The big policy for me would be around education: lack of school places for secondary school children, lack of teachers in general. New policies around hospitals and healthcare also going in a downwards trend to me. Both issues are heading in the wrong direction.” “Wrong direction: scared about Dublin riots in city centre. Gardaí did manage to subdue, but was very scary for everyone. Feel it could have been avoided.” “The RTÉ TV licence scandal.

2024/2/26,"Varadkar to attend Ukraine summit in Paris Ukrainians and supporters march through Dublin in their thousands to mark second anniversary of Russia’s invasion Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is set to attend a special meeting of European leaders in Paris on Monday which is being hosted by French president Emmanuel Macron with the aim of discussing support for Ukraine. Two years on from the Russian invasion, Mr Macron is understood to want to discuss new solutions and ways to help Ukraine. Mr Varadkar is due to travel to Paris for the summit, which will be attended by a number of other European leaders and government representatives. “Two years after the start of the invasion of Ukraine this working meeting will be an opportunity to study ways to boost the co-operation between partners in support to Ukraine,” the Elysee palace said. French officials said Mr Macron is determined to send a message to Moscow that there is no “Ukraine fatigue” in Europe despite fears over continued US support. Meanwhile, Ukrainians and their supporters marched through Dublin city centre in their thousands on Saturday to mark the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion. The march, organised by charity Ukrainian Action in Ireland, began outside the GPO on O’Connell Street, and ended with speeches and song outside Government Buildings. Since the invasion more than 100,000 Ukrainians have resettled in Ireland. In a speech delivered to the marchers at Merrion Square, Larysa Gerasko, the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland, called on “all democratic nations” to remain steadfast in their support of Ukraine. “I want to remind to all that the war is already in Europe, just behind you, just next to your door,” she said. “All democratic nations, we have to stop Russian aggression, and we have to stop Putin.” Ms Gerasko also called for those in attendance to pressure governments to send more armaments to Ukraine. “The situation in the frontline, in the battlefield, is very difficult, and very serious. We need more weapons, we need more arms, we need more ammunition in order to defend ourselves, and to defend you.” As the crowd marched towards Merrion Square, demonstrators were led in various chants, including “Peace for Ukraine” and “Thank you Ireland” and “Slava Ukraini”. One Garda source estimated that 5,000 people were in attendance. Many in the crowd wore Ukrainian flags draped around their shoulders or traditional floral wreaths. Inna Shevchenko (37), marching hand-in-hand with her seven-year-old son, said she arrived in Ireland about three months after the Russian invasion in February 2022. “We first didn’t believe it would continue so long, so we stayed in Hungary, near the border,” said Ms Shevchenko (37), from Kyiv. “Then [after] three months, we came here.” She has settled in Castleknock, Dublin, but ultimately, with much of her family still in Ukraine, her wish is to return to her homeland. “Ireland is beautiful, but it’s my motherland, and I love it,” she said.",0,1
2024/2/26,"Rory Hearne to seek nomination to stand for Social Democrats in European elections Academic and housing policy commentator is seeking to run in the Midlands North West constituency Academic and housing policy commentator Rory Hearne is expected to seek the Social Democrats nomination to stand in the European Parliament elections. It is understood Mr Hearne (44), who recently joined the centre-left party, is planning to seek its nomination to stand in the Midlands North West constituency. He is currently an associate professor and senior lecturer in social policy in Maynooth University. The current MEPs in the constituency are Luke “Ming” Flanagan (Independent), Maria Walsh (Fine Gael), Chris MacManus (Sinn Féin) and Colm Markey (Fine Gael). Barry Cowen has been selected to stand for Fianna Fáil in the race, while Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín and Michelle Gildernew, a current Sinn Féin MP for Fermanagh-South Tyrone, will also be on the ballot. The number of seats in the constituency increases from four to five in the upcoming European Parliament elections, which will take place in early June. The Social Democrats has yet to hold conventions to formally select its candidates for the elections. However, it is understood Mr Hearne has the backing of the party leadership to run in Midlands North West. A spokesman for the party said it was planning to hold selection conventions in the coming weeks to choose candidates in all three of the European constituencies. Speaking about his intention to stand in the elections, Mr Hearne said he wanted to represent the generation “locked out” of the housing market. “The housing crisis is a disaster, the social contract is broken,” he said. “The housing crisis has become a European housing crisis…The EU could be doing a lot more on housing.” The academic said joining a political party had been a “big step” which he had not taken lightly. The Social Democrats were the “best fit” and matched his own values, he said. There was a “real momentum behind the party”. He said if elected to the European Parliament he would also look to focus on the issues of workers rights, the war in Gaza and climate change. “I’m really concerned about the rise of the far right. Ireland is not full… Ireland is full of vacant and derelict buildings.” Mr Hearne previously unsuccessfully stood for election for People Before Profit in the 2007 general election in the former Dublin South East constituency. More recently he stood as an Independent in the 2020 Seanad election on the NUI panel.",0,1
2024/2/29,"Fianna Fáil to run three candidates in Midlands-North-West where it has not had MEP since 2014 Senators Lisa Chambers and Niall Blaney added to the ticket alongside convention winner Barry Cowen Fianna Fáil have adopted what is considered a risky strategy by deciding to run three candidates in Midlands-North-West for the European Parliament elections in June – it is a constituency where the party has not held a seat for a decade. The party’s national constituencies committee announced on Thursday it was adding Senators Niall Blaney and Lisa Chambers to the ticket to join Barry Cowen, who won the constituency convention on February 5th. Fianna Fáil had originally planned to run two candidates, with most party figures predicting a ticket of Mr Cowen and Ms Chambers. However, the Donegal-based Mr Blaney, who was considered the back marker, performed exceptionally well in the convention, finishing second to Mr Cowen with 803 votes to 894. Ms Chambers won 570. While Ms Chamber was always expected to be added to the ticket, the strong showing of Mr Blaney in the convention was seen to have forced the party’s hand. Mr Blaney said he was unsure until Thursday as to whether or not he would be added as a candidate. “I am delighted to be on the ticket at last. I was worried for the last week or more. But my performance in the convention was very hard to ignore.” Fianna Fáil’s director of elections Darragh O’Brien said the three candidates were strategically spread across the vast constituency, which comprises 15 counties. It now has five seats, compared with four in 2019. “[The candidates] bring unique and complementary strengths and abilities to our ticket. I know they will individually and collectively work hard to maximise our vote and ensure that we are successful in June,” he said. No decisions have been taken yet as to how the constituency will be divided between Mr Cowen, Mr Blaney and Ms Chambers. Asked if he thought the three-candidate strategy was risky, Mr Blaney said: “It’s hard to know. With two candidates there was an obvious divide. I don’t know if, or how, you divide it with three.” Mr Blaney said he had started his campaign for Europe nearly a year ago. Mr Cowen said on Thursday he was delighted with the convention result on February 5th and was now happy to lead a strong team of three candidates. He said he would fully co-operate with the director of elections in “our combined efforts to maximise support”. Ms Chambers said running three was “always a risk” no matter what strategy, but she said the party had invested a lot of time and research into the decision. “We ran two candidates when Midlands-North-West was a four-seater and we are now running three when it has increased to five. I have to trust that the party has made the right call.” She said the party was targeting two seats out of five. Fianna Fáil has not held a seat in this constituency for 10 years. The then sitting MEP Pat ‘The Cope’ Gallagher was not successful in retaining his seat in the 2014 elections. Meanwhile, it now seems increasingly likely that energy entrepreneur and former Bord Gáis head John Mullins will be Fine Gael’s second candidate in the South constituency. With the closing date for nominations this weekend, Cork-based Mr Mullins and sitting MEP Seán Kelly were the only confirmed candidates as of Thursday night. The convention will be held in Clonmel on the following weekend. Fine Gael currently has two MEPs in the constituency but Deirdre Clune announced in November 2023 that she would not be seeking re-election. The party’s Midland-North-West convention is being held at the end of the month with the sitting MEPs Maria Walsh and Colm Markey expected to be selected.",0,1
2024/2/3,"‘We are the mainstream’: The rise of anti-immigration sentiment in new political parties Immigration has become a pressing issue in Irish politics, but will that lead to electoral gains for the far right?   Crooksling is about 8km south of Tallaght on the N81, close to the village of Brittas. The only thing of note in the townland is a large nursing home, St Brigid’s, that was closed down in March 2020. In recent weeks, a rumour spread that the home might be the latest facility to be used to accommodate asylum seekers. Protests were organised. On Tuesday night this week, group of people from Brittas gathered on the verge of the N81. A large sign had been prepared that said: ‘Brittas Community Says No. Please Listen to Us’. It was one of hundreds such protests that have taken place around immigration and accommodation centres in the past two years; there were 307 throughout the State in 2022 and a similar number in 2023. Among the local protesters on Tuesday were a small number of outsiders, waving Tricolours. Fergus Power, a far-right activist, was among them. He tweeted video footage of the protest. Another far-right actor, self-styled citizen journalist Philip Dwyer, had come to Crooksling the previous week and put up live video content on social media. There is a group of far-right flying pickets who have shown up at big flashpoints, blockades and protests. They repeat the familiar tropes of “unvetted males”; “men of military age”; “Ireland is full” and “care for the Irish homeless first” – language with racist and xenophobic undertones. Those who protest are described as “patriots” and the accommodation centres portrayed as “plantation centres”. All are active on social media, focusing on producing video content in particular. Besides Dwyer and Power, others in this group include Gavin Pepper, Michael O’Keeffe, Michael Brazil and Cork-based Derek Blighe. Members of this group have travelled to anti-immigration flashpoints that have sprang up in recent months, putting out “calls to action” to “patriots” to attend those protests. There is a playbook: to stoke up fears in communities, and to foment division and confrontation, says Mark Malone, researcher for Hope and Courage, an organisation that works with community groups and which monitors the activities and extremism of the far right. “Those that are doing it on a regular basis, and are significant content producers, the inner core, it’s probably about 25 to 30 people,” he says. Unlike the rest of Europe where right-wing parties have gained significant support over the past decade, the right has remained a marginal presence in Ireland. The National Party, then led by Justin Barrett, ran 10 candidates in the 2020 general election, garnering only about 0.7 per cent support. Dwyer stood in Dublin South West and received 508 votes, and finished second last out of 16 candidates. The Irish Freedom Party, led by Hermann Kelly, ran 11 candidates in 2020, with an average of about 0.5 per cent of the vote. Immigration was practically off the radar of Irish political discourse until the beginning of the war in Ukraine. The first Irish Times/Ipsos B&A Snapshot poll published last Monday showed how immigration has shot up to become the most pressing issue for Irish people (with 24 per cent first mentions compared with only 5 per cent in August 2023). The rhetoric pushed by right-wing activists has gained traction, especially in communities where centres have been proposed. The number of followers on social media has also grown. Malone said that one social media post from an Irish far-right actor received half a million views. Some of the language has now been appropriated by independents and politicians from the larger parties. Along with the National Party and the Irish Freedom Party, three more right-wing parties have emerged in the past six months. Many right-wing activists will probably be candidates with these new parties. Ireland First, for example, is led by Blighe and calls for deportations and strict limits on migrant numbers.. The second, the Irish People, is a technical party, which will not apply a whip. It claims the Government has “moved heaven and earth to house those arriving while our own people are being made homeless or hopeless” and that  “climate hysteria has replaced science” ... One of its founders, AJ Cahill, previously ran as a left-of-centre candidate in Galway. He says he still regards himself as such but claims the left has become extreme and intolerant, and in tandem with the media has limited dialogue on certain issues. The third, the Farmers Alliance, is aimed at farmers who oppose new environmental and climate change rules but also has strong anti-migrant language on its website. It was set up by Donegal sheep farmer Liam McLaughlin. The party’s website says of asylum seekers: “Many of these people are coming from the UK and France as they can get more money and free housing here. There are no background checks. We do not know what crimes they have committed or ideologies they are beholden to.” McLaughlin has denied the party is anti-immigrant or right wing, saying it recognises the need for legal migrants and that its views were similar to communities who opposed accommodation centres for asylum seekers. The National Party, meanwhile, seems to be in disarray after having been torn apart by a feud between Barrett and party deputy leader James Reynolds. The Electoral Commission is deciding which faction has the right to style itself as the National Party. Reynolds has confirmed he will contest the Midlands-North West European Parliament constituency in the June election. Kelly, the Irish Freedom Party’s leader, has worked for Eurosceptic groups and MEPs in Brussels for 15 years. His party has been described as xenophobic, anti-immigrant and extreme but Kelly denies this. “We are not extreme. We are in the mainstream because 75 per cent, according to the polls, believe that we have had enough of immigration into Ireland,” he said. The Government and left-wing Opposition parties were happy with “a large amount of unvetted immigration into the island”, he said. “We don’t know if these people have criminal records and how much they cost in welfare and accommodation.” Kelly said he had no problem with the 31,000 work permits granted by the State last year to “people with skills who could contribute to society and weren’t a drain on the welfare system”. The messages and policy demands of the five parties are broadly similar: strict border controls; mass deportation; the prioritisation of Irish people over migrants for homes and services; policies that are sceptical about climate change; pro-rural policies; policies tied to traditional families and values; virulent opposition to the liberal agenda; and Christian Right and anti-EU policies. In most cases, they are also opposed to vaccines. Has the moment arrived when these small parties will begin to gain traction as others have in Europe? With the National Party partly sidelined, Kelly says his party will be the strongest. The party is running candidates in all three European constituencies. Kelly himself is standing in Midlands-North West. The party will announce its first tranche of 20 candidates for the local elections soon. Kelly says the party can win seats and claims it is close to 3 per cent in the polls. It is currently lumped under “others”. Ireland First says it is running four candidates, according to its website, including Blighe, who is running in Fermoy and Cork East. Cahill says Irish People has interviewed 30 potential candidates so far and will interview more. McLaughlin of Farmers Alliance has said the party already has 40 candidates lined up for the local elections. Some right-wing activists are likely to run as independents, including Pepper and the former Workers Party member Malachy Steenson, both in Dublin. Cumulatively, there will be more avowedly right-wing candidates on the ballot papers than ever before. But will they make gains? Most TDs and Senators interviewed by The Irish Times this week dismissed the possibility, saying that independents would gain most at the expense of the three biggest parties, if immigration remained the dominant issue. “Just 1 per cent of people in Ireland said they’re open to voting for a party that’s far right,” said Fine Gael Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris on Thursday. “So I don’t think we should overstate this but Ireland isn’t immune from the dangers of the far right.” Gary Murphy, professor of politics in Dublin City University, said the bigger political parties and independents were acutely aware of the issue and were triangulating rapidly, bringing in tougher policies to counter any incipient threat from the right. “You saw it this week with the addition of Algeria and Botswana to the list of safe countries and the decision to charter planes. The Government is making up immigration policy on the hoof but so are the Opposition. Everyone is scrambling to get some kind of handle on it,” he said. “It’s easier said than done as most Irish people are generous enough in their attitudes. That said, there is significant concern among citizens that that we are taking too many in and we would be foolish to think that this won’t matter come the election.” Murphy said that immigration could be one of those singular issues that crop up in Irish elections from time to time and get people elected. The counterpoint, he said, was that there was no evidence from the past that small parties campaigning on single issues have broken through. His conclusion? A big breakthrough by the right is unlikely. “With five parties in that space, it dilutes the chances,” he said. “If there was one right-wing party, it might have a chance of some gains.”",0,1
2024/2/4,"Varadkar and Sunak to visit Belfast in wake of restored powersharing at Stormont Taoiseach and UK prime minister to hold bilateral talks while in Northern Ireland The Taoiseach and the UK prime minister are to travel to Belfast following the restoration of powersharing in the North. Leo Varadkar and Rishi Sunak are set to hold bilateral talks while in Northern Ireland for meetings following the re-establishment of the Assembly and Executive. They are also due to meet the new Executive ministers and MLAs. Mr Varadkar said he had spoken by phone to Michelle O’Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly, the new first and deputy first ministers, “to congratulate them and wish them a fair wind in their work”. Following a “very positive weekend”, the Taoiseach said he was looking forward to meeting Mr Sunak “to discuss the welcome return of the Assembly and the Executive”. “We both want to see the Good Friday agreement work for everyone on the island,” he said. Ministers in the Northern Executive are expected to meet on Monday, with a first sitting of the Assembly planned for Tuesday. The Minister for Health, Robin Swann, has written to trade unions inviting them to “early discussions” aimed at settling the dispute over public sector pay which led to mass strike action last month. “That is my immediate priority and I want to see pay negotiations being initiated without delay,” he said. The UK government has promised to release a funding package following the restoration of the Northern institutions, which includes money earmarked for public sector pay dispute, though it is not yet clear if the amount provided is sufficient. Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Ms O’Neill said Northern Ireland’s funding model was “the number one priority issue that we have collectively” in the Executive. Devolved government was up and running for the first time in two years on Saturday, after the DUP made a deal with the UK government to end its boycott over post-Brexit trading arrangements. The Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O’Neill, who was nominated as First Minister, became the first nationalist to hold the post in Northern Ireland’s history, while the DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly took the role of Deputy First Minister. Mr Sunak, who arrived in Northern Ireland on Sunday evening, is expected to focus on community engagements during the two-day visit. Speaking during a visit to Air Ambulance Northern Ireland in Lisburn on Sunday night, Mr Sunak said there was a “fantastic cause for optimism” after the return of Stormont and said there was now a “special opportunity” for the North’s political leaders. He said the £3.3bn represented a “generous and fair settlement for Northern Ireland” and it would ensure public finances were “sustainable for the long term.” Downing Street said he would meet “emergency responders, community heroes and families of those directly helped by the service” on Sunday. On Monday the UK prime minister will be welcomed to Stormont Castle by Ms O’Neill and Ms Little-Pengelly as joint heads of government in Northern Ireland. He will also meet the leaders of the North’s political parties and the new Stormont ministers at Parliament Buildings. Mr Sunak will also “continue community engagements, which will focus on the future of Northern Ireland and the hopes of the generations to come, following last year’s marking of 25 years since the signing of the 1998 Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement. - Additional copy PA",0,1
2024/2/5,"Barry Cowen narrowly selected as Fianna Fáil European election candidate in keenly contested convention Offaly TD edged out nearest rival by 70 votes in Mullingar count Offaly TD Barry Cowen has been chosen as the Fianna Fáil candidate for the Midlands North West constituency of the European Parliament, after edging out Senator Niall Blaney by only 70 votes in a keenly contested convention in Mullingar. In the most competitive convention to date, a total of 2,267 Fianna Fáil members in the  constituency cast their votes during Monday for the three candidates. With a quota set at 1,134 for the single seat, Mr Cowen won 894 votes in the first count compared to 803 for Mr Blaney. The Mayo Senator Lisa Chambers won 570 and was eliminated. Ms Chambers’ votes were distributed in the second count and were almost evenly divided between the two remaining candidates. Mr Cowen won an extra 248 votes to finish with 1,140 compared to 1.070 votes for Mr Blaney who received 268 transfers from Ms Chambers. Party members cast their votes in four centres across the sprawling constituency - Navan, Mullingar, Sligo town and Athenry - between 11am and 4pm on Monday. The votes from the three other centres were then transferred to the Mullingar House Hotel where counting began after 6pm. Fianna Fáil has not held a seat in this constituency for 10 years. The then-sitting MEP Pat ‘The Cope’ Gallagher was not successful in retaining his seat in the 2014 elections. Several hundred people were present when the first count was announced shortly after 8pm, including former Taoiseach Brian Cowen, a brother of Barry Cowen. He received a prolonged standing ovation from the delegates after being announced. The party is expected to add an additional name to the ticket and Ms Chambers, the party’s leader in the Seanad, is seen as the favourite to be the second candidate, notwithstanding the strong performance by Mr Blaney. Longford-Westmeath TD Robert Troy urged the party leadership to finalise the ticket without delay saying the party needed to “move on swiftly”. The Fianna Fáil director of elections for the European parliamentary elections, Darragh O’Brien, said all three candidates were strong but reminded the delegates the party had “a battle ahead of ourselves, no question”. When nominations closed, the former MEP Pat the Cope Gallagher was also a candidate but withdrew early in the race. With Midlands North West now becoming a five-seat constituency, the party is confident it can win at least one seat. The constituency is currently represented by Independent Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan,  Sinn Féin’s  Chris McManus and Fine Gael’s Colum Markey and Maria Walsh. “We will work as hard as we possibly can to make sure that Fianna Fáil wins back a seat,” said Mr Cowen, adding that he wanted the party to win a second seat.",0,1
2024/2/6,"Former taoiseach John Bruton dies following long illness Fine Gael politician (76) led Rainbow Coalition government from December 1994 to June 1997 Former taoiseach John Bruton has died following a long illness. He was 76. Mr Bruton, who was the Fine Gael leader from 1990 to 2001, headed the Rainbow Coalition government, which also involved Labour and Democratic Left, between December 1994 and June 1997. He was not returned to power in 1997, when Bertie Ahern’s Fianna Fáil won the first of three straight general elections, but stayed on as party leader for almost four years. He was succeeded as Fine Gael leader by Michael Noonan after losing a confidence vote in January 2001. The former Meath TD went on to serve as the EU’s ambassador to the United States from 2004 to 2009. President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar were among those who paid tribute to Mr Bruton following the news of his death on Tuesday.  First elected to the Dáil aged 22 in 1969, Mr Bruton held a number of ministries – including the finance, public service and industry portfolios – while Garret FitzGerald was taoiseach during the 1980s. During his time as minister for finance, Mr Bruton presided over the infamous budget decision in 1982 to impose VAT on clothing and footwear. He decided to change the rate for those items from zero to 18 per cent – including for children’s items. The vote on the budget was lost by 82-81. The government fell because some key independent supporters, notably Limerick socialist TD Jim Kemmy, decided not to offer their support. Mr Bruton was the deputy leader of Fine Gael from 1987 to 1990, serving under Alan Dukes. A statement from the Bruton family, released by Fine Gael on Tuesday, said: “It is with deep sadness we wish to announce the death of former Taoiseach John Bruton. “He died peacefully in the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin, surrounded by his loving family, early this morning following a long illness. “He was a good husband, a good father and a true patriot. “We will miss him greatly. “John is survived by his wife, Finola, son Matthew and daughters; Juliana, Emily and Mary-Elizabeth, grandchildren, sons-in-law, his brother, Richard and sister, Mary, nieces, nephews, many cousins and extended family.” More to follow ...",0,1
2024/2/6,"Measles outbreak threat triggers plan for catch-up vaccinations for young adults   Minister for Health to brief Cabinet on concerns about transmission of disease in wake of HSE warning Plans are being made for an urgent catch-up vaccination programme for young adults against measles after the Health Service Executive warned the probability of an outbreak in Ireland was high. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly will brief Cabinet on Tuesday that a significant increase of measles cases notified in Europe this winter, coupled with falling rates of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine uptake in Ireland, has raised concerns about wide transmission of the disease in Ireland in 2024. One-fifth of the population in some counties have no protection against measles, due to low vaccination rates. Mr Donnelly will tell colleagues that, following the rapid risk assessment carried out by the HSE “the probability of the introduction and transmission of measles in Ireland is high”. Health officials have begun testing their response systems in the event of cases occurring, he will say. Sources say concern about the highly contagious virus is focused on regions and population cohorts with particularly low vaccine uptake, as well as congregated settings. Measles cases have soared in Europe since the beginning of 2023. In England, 170 cases of measles were notified in an outbreak in the west midlands between December 2023 and mid-January 2024. Ireland recorded only four cases of the disease last year, imported from outside the EU in a single family outbreak. No cases were reported this year up to January 27th last. The only protection against measles is vaccination. MMR vaccine uptake in Ireland is currently below the World Health Organisation recommended target uptake of 95 per cent. Nationally, uptake has been below 90 per cent for seven consecutive quarters. There are also significant geographic variations with uptake rates below 80 per cent in Co Louth and Co Meath, but as high as 94 per cent in Dublin Southwest. Younger men tend to be the cohort at greatest risk. A recent study estimated that almost one-in-five males between 18 and 19 are non-immune to measles. The figure is also high among young adults in general, with just over 10 per cent of people between 18 and 35 having no immunity. The likely reason for this high level of non-immunity stems from misinformation in the past about the MMR vaccine that falsely linked it to a risk of autism, according to a briefing note for Cabinet. As autism is more often diagnosed in young male children, it is likely that a cohort of now young men were not vaccinated due to parental decisions informed by this erroneous science, which has since been discredited, the note states. Mr Donnelly will outline measures being taken to address the threat, in addition to communication campaigns. Measles has been added to the list of notifiable infectious diseases, requiring immediate preliminary notification by telephone to a medical officer, since May 2023. The timing of the MMR vaccination offered in junior infants has moved from the second school term to the first to provide protection as early as possible. An MMR catch-up programme was launched through GPs in November 2023, aimed at children who did not receive the MMR vaccine when they were 12 months old and/or did not receive the second vaccination when four or five years of age when in junior infants. The HSE is also examining a proposal for an MMR catch-up programme in Leaving Cert students to target unvaccinated teenagers, Mr Donnelly will tell colleagues. It is looking at a possibility of a similar campaign in colleges and higher educational institutions aimed at those in their late teens and 20s.",0,1
2024/2/6,"Seán Haughey announces he will not contest next general election Fianna Fáil  Dublin Bay North TD  has served for almost 40 years as an elected representative Fianna Fáil Dublin Bay North TD Seán Haughey has announced that he will not contest the next general election. His decision to comes after almost 40 years as an elected representative. In a statement, he said: “Having devoted all my adult life to public service, I have come to the view that now is the right time for me to step down from frontline politics.” Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin paid tribute to his departing colleague saying he is “a man of great integrity, a fine parliamentarian and someone who takes pride in being meticulous in every aspect of his work.” He highlighted Mr Haughey’s “deep commitment to the well-being of those he represents” and thanked him on behalf of Fianna Fáil “as he embarks on a new chapter.’’ Mr Haughey, the son of the late taoiseach Charlie Haughey, was first elected to Dublin City Council in 1985 and later served a Lord Mayor. He was elected as a Senator in 1987 and first won a Dáil seat for the Dublin North Central constituency in 1992. He served as a Minister of State at the Department of Education between 2006 and 2011. Mr Haughey lost his seat in 2011 when Fianna Fáil had a disastrous result in the wake of the economic crisis. However, he returned to Dublin City Council when he won a seat in the 2014 Local Elections and then regained his Dáil seat in the new Dublin Bay North constituency in 2016. Mr Haughey told his local party organisation of this decision not to contest the next election on Tuesday evening. Fianna Fáil councillor Deirdre Heney has been mentioned among possible candidates for the party at the next election, having made previous bids to be elected to the Dáil. It is also possible that another Haughey could end up on the ticket in Dublin Bay North. Cathal Haughey, a nephew of the departing TD, is a candidate in the area for the upcoming local elections. On Tuesday, Seán Haughey said serving in various roles during his political career had been “a tremendous honour”. He thanked constituents for their support and the trust they placed in him, Mr Haughey said that during his time in politics, he “found it enormously fulfilling to be able to give advice and assistance to hundreds of individuals, groups, and organisations in helping them secure the benefits and services to which they were entitled.” He added: “I am also proud that I could carry on a family tradition of public service in the constituency dating right back to the 1950s.” Mr Haughey said he is “deeply grateful” to his wife Orla, four children and his extended family as well as “the many loyal party members and lifelong friends for their unfailing help and encouragement in all my election campaigns.” He said he remains “fully committed to Fianna Fáil as a democratic party, at the centre of Irish political life, advancing a caring social philosophy, and capable of resolving the many and varied problems that now we now face.” Mr Haughey is the first Fianna Fáil TD in the current Dáil to announce he will not stand at the next election. Sligo TD Marc MacSharry, who left Fianna Fáil in 2022, previously announced he will step down from politics at the next general election. Several Fine Gael politicians, including Dublin Bay North TD Richard Bruton, have announced they will not contest the next election.",0,1
2024/2/6,"British government urged to put North’s finances on ‘sustainable footing’ Letter presented to British PM Rishi Sunak by Stormont Ministers setting out ‘inadequate NI funding model’    Stormont is asking for a fair funding model that is “taken for granted” by other devolved governments, First Minister Michelle O’Neill told the first sitting of the restored Northern Ireland Assembly. A motion urging the British government to put Northern Ireland’s finances on a “sustainable footing”, received unanimous backing in the chamber. During a debate, Ms O’Neill said she and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly felt it was important that a “very clear sign of a shared view of the importance of the matter was sent out”. An amendment brought by the SDLP — which forms the official Opposition — calling for Ministers to produce costed plans for revitalising public services, in line with a comprehensive programme for government, was also passed. The first day of Assembly business came a day after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and British prime minister Rishi Sunak travelled to Belfast for bilateral talks with parties following the restoration of the powersharing institutions at the weekend following its two-year collapse. A letter was presented to Mr Sunak by newly elected Stormont Ministers on Monday setting out the North’s current funding model which the parties say is inadequate despite a pre-Christmas £3.3 billion (€3.8 billion) package offered by the British government to deliver Northern Ireland’s public services. Mr Sunak described the offer as a “generous and fair settlement” — comments echoed by Northern Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris — but the letter said it would only provide a “short-term solution to the pressing issues we now face”. More than £580 million of the UK package is earmarked for a public sector pay award following a long-running dispute that led to mass strike action last month. “We’re not asking for special treatment. We’re asking for fairness and equality,” said Ms O’Neill. “We are asking for funding that reflects the needs of the people that we serve and we are asking for a funding model that is taken for granted in Scotland, Wales, but it’s being denied to us here. The British government had hoped that we would be bowled over by the headline figure [£3.3 billion] and rush to accept it without due diligence … that’s not how we roll.” Ms Little-Pengelly said in her 17 years as a special adviser at Stormont and junior minister before becoming Deputy First Minister, she had never seen the Executive collectively sign a letter on the first day. “That sends a very strong and positive message and I hope it sends a very, very clear indication to the government that we are serious about this,” she said. During the day’s proceedings, there was a lengthy suspension to appoint the chairmen/women of various Stormont scrutiny committees, including a new watchdog committee on the Windsor Framework Agreement. Chaired by Sinn Féin MLA Declan Kearney with the DUP’s David Brooks as vice-chairman, the committee will consider updates to European Union law which might apply to Northern Ireland as a result of the post-Brexit trade deal and report back on their significance. Sinn Féin’s Carál Ní Chuilín was also elected as principal deputy speaker, one of three deputy speakers who will assist Speaker Edwin Poots in chairing meetings.",0,1
2024/2/8,"Irish basketball players in ‘very difficult position’ ahead of Israel fixture, Minister says Despite views of some players, Basketball Ireland insists it cannot afford financial or competitive implications of not playing Irish basketball players have been put in a “very difficult position” regarding their  fixture against Israel later on Thursday, the Dáil has been told. Minister for Finance Michael McGrath said “leadership” and “decisiveness” were  needed from FIBA, the International Basketball Federation. The Fianna Fáil TD said the current situation was “not fair” on the players, and a decision to withdraw from the game “should not fall on them”. Ireland‘s game against Israel in the FIBA Women’s EuroBasket 2025 qualification competition takes place on Thursday evening. It was originally due to take place in Israel last November but was postponed due to the Israel-Hamas conflict, and later rescheduled for a neutral venue in Riga, Latvia. Basketball Ireland has insisted it cannot afford the financial or competitive implications of not playing the game, with its chief executive John Feehan stating the potential sanctions could set the Ireland women’s team back a decade. Mr McGrath was responding to Sinn Féin TD Mark Ward, who outlined how photographs were published online this week of the Israeli team posing with armed members of the Israeli Defence Forces in Tel Aviv. In addition, a member of the Israeli squad told Israel’s official basketball website that it was “known that they [Ireland] are quite anti-Semitic”. Mr Ward said these comments were “another attempt” to intimidate the Irish basketball team. “Taking a stand against mass displacement and the murder of innocent people is not anti-Semitism,” he said. “Being anti-genocide is not anti-Semitism. The behaviour of the Israeli team alone this week should be enough for Basketball Ireland to withdraw from the match. It’s not too late to do the right thing.” The Dublin Mid-West TD asked the Minister whether  the Government condemned Israeli basketball players posing with guns and labelling Irish athletes anti-Semitic. In response, Mr McGrath said the Government’s position on what was happening in the Middle East was very clear and it was continuing to call for an immediate humanitarian cease. However, he said the Government does not interfere in decisions that are “appropriately made by relevant sporting organisations when it comes to fulfilling fixtures”. “Were the Government to get into that space, I think it would be completely wrong and inappropriate,” he said. “I do believe that the players themselves have been placed in a very difficult position, but it’s not because of the Government or Basketball Ireland. “What we need here is leadership and a decision and decisiveness from FIBA, from the international organisation who are putting individual players or individual countries into a position where they have to make the call, which can impact on their own careers and also impact on their ability to compete in the future and on funding. “It’s not fair on them – and it should not fall on them to make that decision.”",0,1
2024/2/8,"McGrath claims Sinn Féin policies would impact supply of new homes  Minister tells Dáil that party would create an ‘unfriendly’ environment for private investors  The supply of new homes would fall if Sinn Féin policies were adopted,  Minister for Finance Michael McGrath has told the Dáil. Mr McGrath said the party was seeking to create an environment that was “unfriendly” towards private investment needed to build new homes. The Fianna Fáil TD was responding during Leaders’ Questions on Thursday to Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty,  who raised the latest rental index report from the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) for the third quarter of 2023, which showed a continued rise in rent for both new and existing tenancies. Almost 30 per cent of new tenancy rents across Ireland were more than €2,000 per month in the third quarter of last year, while in Dublin more than half of new tenancies were in excess of this figure. Mr Doherty said the rental sector was clearly in crisis while the Government was continuing to say “they’ve turned a corner” in relation to housing. He said there was growing evidence landlords were breaching caps in rent pressure zones and asked what would the Government do about it. “You’ve done nothing so far, and workers and families desperately need relief,” he said. The Sinn Féin TD said his party would ban further rent increases for a period of at least three years while putting a month’s rent back into renter’s pockets, as well as “dramatically increase” the supply of social, affordable and cost rental homes. In response, Mr McGrath said the report was not a barometer of compliance with RPZ legislation because it captured all tenancies, including those which were outside the rent pressure zones. He said it also showed that rent levels for existing tenancies were about 18 per cent below those for new tenancies. Mr McGrath said compliance with rent pressure zones was a function of the RTB and they were “active in that regard”. He said where breaches were taking place, they should be reported to the board, which would carry out enforcement work. Mr McGrath added the reason why rents were rising was because of a “mismatch between supply and demand” but significant progress was being made in homebuilding, with 32,700 homes built in 2023, a 10 per cent improvement on the previous year. The Minister said currently at least €13 billion of capital was needed to build over 30,000 homes a year. “The State is providing €4bn to €5bn of that, we are likely over the period ahead to revise upwards the housing targets in Housing for All [plan] and that will mean much more capital needed, perhaps up to €20bn a year on average over the next number of years to build the homes that we need,” he told Mr Doherty. “You are seeking to create an environment that is unfriendly to that investment, that will result in that investment stalling and that ultimately will impact on the supply of homes.” Labour leader Ivana Bacik said the RTB report showed there was clearly an issue with “flagrant breaches of renting law” if rents were increasing in RPZs. Ms Bacik said Ireland was an outlier in the lack of protections given to renters and asked when would homes be built at “the scale we need”.",0,1
2024/2/9,"New Nato agreement shaped by Russian aggression and fears of hybrid threats Government officials see Individual Tailored Partnership Programme as continuation of previous Nato arrangements but more streamlined and efficient Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is approaching its second grim anniversary, has focused the minds of both Nato members and traditionally neutral countries. On the Nato side, members are worried that should a shooting war break out with Russia, the large and unwieldy alliance would not be able to defend Europe in a coherent manner, fears that have been exacerbated by the presence of pro-Moscow leaders in Hungary and Slovakia. For neutrals like Ireland, the chief concern is so-called hybrid threats; offensive action which falls below military aggression and is often hard to detect, much less attribute. Recent events have shown neutrality offers little defence to such threats. There have been examples of this all over the EU, from Russian warships posturing off the west coast of Ireland to Russian espionage operations in Helsinki. These concerns were top of the agenda during the 2022 Nato summit in Madrid. Then taoiseach Micheál Martin attended a dinner on the margins of the event, generating a few days of controversy back home. Much of the focus of the summit was on devising a new programme which would reinvigorate the Partnership for Peace (PFP) programme, an initiative devised after the end of the cold war partly as a kind of halfway house for former Soviet countries seeking Nato membership. The solution was the Individual Tailored Partnership Programme or ITPP, a streamlined programme which would replace all the previous complex and overlapping partnership agreements and allow non-Nato countries to co-operate with the alliance on areas where they felt they were lacking. This could be maritime security, special forces, air policing or any number of other areas. The underlying idea is that the programmes can be tailor-made to each individual partner nation while not requiring any of the common defence commitments expected by fully paid-up Nato members. Ireland entered into its ITPP agreement with Nato at the start of 2024. Government officials see it as a continuation of previous Nato arrangements, but one which is more streamlined and efficient. The agreement will give Ireland better access to Nato intelligence and allow it to set more focused goals. Many of these have been shaped by recent events, such as threats to undersea cables, the rising risk of election inference and the risk of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. In simple terms, Ireland will devise a goal – for example improving surveillance of undersea cables – and use Nato expertise and advice to achieve it. At the end, Nato assessors will decide if they’ve been successful. The ITPP will also improve Ireland’s ability to work with Nato militaries overseas during peacekeeping missions. This is seen as critical as Ireland moves away from the triple-lock system of requiring UN approval for foreign deployments. In future, the Defence Forces are more likely to be deployed in peacekeeping missions under an EU or Nato banner, meaning interoperability will be crucial. The Government will be keen to point out the ITPP is not a step towards full Nato membership. “Participation in the ITPP does not signal an intent to join Nato but rather to enhance our engagement in areas of co-operation of clear interest to Ireland,” a Department of Defence spokesman said, pointing out that Europe’s other traditional neutrals, Switzerland, Malta and Austria, have already signed up to their own agreements. Military sources also welcomed the move. Ireland has formally co-operated with Nato since joining PFP in 1999 but has, due to political considerations, never fully exploited the partnership. Nato officials in Brussels will also be happy. The alliance benefits just as much from these arrangements as partner nations, as they offer valuable insights into non-members’ defence and security abilities, should they ever be required.",0,1
2024/2/9,"50 years of the Healy-Rae dynasty: Flat caps, populist politics and hard work The Kerry political dynasty has been ‘incredibly good at PR. Margaret Thatcher had Saatchi & Saatchi. The Healy-Raes had the Healy-Raes’ The bog road from Kilgarvan rises steeply northwards until it reaches the lower slopes of Mangerton, the big brooding mountain that dominates this corner of south Kerry. There are some green fields here but for the most part the land is unforgiving. One of the townlands in the shadow of Mangerton is called Reacaisleach, or Rae, for short. From this impossibly remote corner of Kerry has come one of the most idiosyncratic and durable political dynasties in Irish politics. This weekend the Healy-Raes celebrate 50 years of public life with a high-profile bash in Kerry: a “dance” in the ballroom of the Gleneagle Hotel in Killarney attended by various generations of the family. The second generation currently has two TDs in the Dáil and, at local level, three councillors drawn from the third generation. The Healy-Rae brand is associated with a thick Kerry accent, a flat-capped Darby O’Gill caricature, a reputation for endless work and a form of politics that is rooted in populist and unashamed clientelism. Jackie Healy-Rae, its patriarch, was born in 1931 – the Rae part of the surname refers to the townland – into great poverty. When he was eight, his father had an accident that confined him to a wheelchair. It was left to Jackie and his mother to provide for his five younger siblings. “Their main source of living was cutting turf and selling it,” said his eldest son Danny. “My grandmother could cut it as good as any man and he was certainly as good as any fellow in any bog from the age of eight.” That endless appetite for hard work has become something of a family trait. Jackie, despite his lack of education, had other talents. He was a strong hurler and a musician of note who played with local bands on the accordion; he also learned how to play the saxophone. He had an entrepreneurial streak; he started a plant hire business and bought a pub. He was keen to be involved in his community. He also knew how to attract attention and get noticed. For one, his mellifluous idiom often drifted straight from the 19th century. And from the time his hair receded in the 1960s, he never appeared in public without a signature hat: first a Russian-style Ushanka fur hat and then a tartan flat cap. “He was known for being a colourful larger-than-life figure, and that certainly didn’t do him any harm in politics,” says the Kerry-based historian, Owen O’Shea. “Historically, Jackie might have been dismissed because of the accent – and we Kerry people are proud of our accent – but behind it all, he was articulating, in his own way, the various problems and issues of concern to people he represented.” Healy-Rae emerged as an influential background figure in the Fianna Fáil organisation in the 1960s. There was a byelection in South Kerry in 1966. Niall Blaney was Fianna Fáil’s election guru at the time. He was impressed by Healy-Rae. “Jackie’s strategy was based around making a fuss, rallying the troops, organising people on the ground,” says O’Shea. “He had a reputation for using razzmatazz: the marching bands, the motorcades, the parades with men carrying pitchforks with blazing sods of turf. The theatre marked him out.” When Blaney left Fianna Fáil, Healy-Rae became the go-to expert in the party for byelections. Danny remembers travelling to Galway, Cork and Mayo with him in the 1970s where he directed campaigns. He was also director of elections in Kerry for three decades. His sons, Michael and Danny, were steeped in politics from childhood. “I was in it with him every step of the way,” says Danny. “We’d milk the cows in the morning and he’d be off to meetings. There was one phone in the house and fellows would be ringing from quare places and I had all of them off by heart. Nothing was strange to me . . . I was in the cumann, and a delegate to the Comhairle Ceantair, and stuck in all of it.” Jackie’s first break came when he was co-opted on to Kerry County Council in December 1973. Despite his best efforts, it took a quarter of a century for him to get his first shot at national politics. When John O’Leary retired in 1997, Healy-Rae, then 66, believed he should be his successor in South Kerry. Fianna Fáil chose O’Leary’s son, Brian, instead. Jackie pushed the nuclear button and ran as an Independent and won a seat against the odds. Former Irish Times parliamentary correspondent Michael O’Regan, a Kerry native, has closely observed the Healy-Raes since the 1960s. “One thing about them was they were incredibly good at PR. Margaret Thatcher had Saatchi & Saatchi. The Healy-Raes had the Healy-Raes,” he says. “They are quite capable of playing to the caricature. Jackie did it all the time. It always generated interest.” Dr Theresa Reidy, a lecturer in politics at UCC, says Jackie was astute in his dealings with taoiseach Bertie Ahern in the Dáil following the 1997 general election but is critical of the kind of “pork barrel” deal struck between the Fianna Fáil government and Independents that favoured one constituency over another. “What was interesting was that Jackie was very strategic in extracting benefits for his constituency in return for conditional support for the government. He used to famously be out of the traps before John O’Donoghue [the Fianna Fáil minister from South Kerry] telling the local people what he had got.” Danny met The Irish Times in his pub in Kilgarvan this week. It’s a spotless old-fashioned country pub, a picture-perfect John B Keane set, complete with a blazing fire. Around the walls are dozens of photographs and posters recording the political and personal lives of the Healy-Raes. Outside, the village itself is well covered with the Healy-Rae name and images. It’s clear that Danny and Michael are different but both are unmistakable chips off the old block. Take their organisational skills and discipline. Michael was the first to be elected in 2011. When Danny was elected five years later the brothers ran the campaign like a military operation, mapping the whole of Kerry into separate Danny and Michael territories. It all came straight from Jackie’s playbook. Reidy says their ability to retain their seats and expand the dynasty has been no surprise. “Their visibility is not an accident. They are two of the most hard-working politicians and have a good sense of what matters to their constituency. I also think they’re able to map national issues back to their constituency in terms of what’s relevant and matters,” she says. The family have other businesses and are sometimes criticised for not putting clear blue water between them and politics. The evidence points to not inconsiderable wealth within the family but they live modest lifestyles, without ostentation. The family’s reputation for modesty was dented by Jackie Healy-Rae jnr, an Independent councillor on Kerry County Council and his younger brother Kevin, sons of TD Michael Healy-Rae, being given suspended sentences for a late-night assault at a chip van in Kenmare on December 28th, 2017. The assault stemmed from Kevin jumping the queue for chips and shouting: “This is my town.” Reidy notes that, politically, the Healy-Raes are masters of ambiguity. She gives the example of them siding with rural communities over the controversy about migrant accommodation, while Michael, from a business side, has been involved in providing accommodation to migrants. Beyond everything else, however, politics is the family business and that means both TD brothers, Michael and Danny, try to leave no phone call unanswered. “Isn’t it great that one family has been doing it for 50 years?” says Danny. “I get no better satisfaction in life than being able to help out a fellow to get a few bob, or get approval for a road, or to get a hospital appointment. “I believe in answering the phone any hour of the day and night, and I get calls late at night for different things. Someone on a trolley in Tralee maybe for 12 or 14 hours, that’s 86 years of age, and some family member would ring. “That’s the appreciation that we get from the people for being available.” Two of Danny’s children, Johnny and Maura, are councillors, joining Michael’s son, Jackie jnr, on Kerry County Council. Maura, a secondary schoolteacher in Bandon, drives up to South Kerry almost every night to canvass, to go to meetings, or to hold clinics. Her accent is softer than her father’s but it’s clear that the approach of this generation will not vary. “The most important thing is being available,” she says, echoing Danny. “The most frequent thing people will say is at least the Healy-Raes will get back to you anyway.” Does this generation have a different world view to their parents and grandfather? No, says Maura. “For the most part, we would share the same thoughts. The issues that I’m dealing with in Kerry County Council: roads, housing, health – we agree on all those things. You know, we’re dealing with the same people most of the time.” Society is changing. Voters’ engagement with politics is changing. But for now, none of that looks like it will have any impact on this singular dynasty. “They got one in every three votes in Kerry in the last election,” says local historian O’Shea. “You cannot deny their enduring success.”",0,1
2024/2/9,"‘No complacency’ in Green Party about referendums, says Minister, as poll shows majority intend to vote Yes  Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman was speaking at launch of the party’s ‘Yes-Yes’ campaign for referendums, which will take place on March 8th  There is “absolutely no complacency” about the outcome of the upcoming referendums on family and care in the wake of an opinion poll showing clear majorities for Yes votes on both issues, Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman has said. He was speaking at the launch of the Green Party’s “Yes-Yes” campaign for the referendums, which will take place on March 8th. The latest Irish Times/Ipsos B&A poll saw 52 per cent of respondents say they would vote Yes in the family referendum. Some 59 per cent said they would vote Yes in the care referendum. Mr O’Gorman said this was a “strong lead” but added: “I always think it’s important to say there’s absolutely no complacency and that’s why the Green Party ... is setting out a strong national campaign.” Senator Pauline O’Reilly – who is leading her party’s efforts to secure Yes votes – said more than 110 candidates will be canvassing for the local elections and referendums simultaneously. “You will see quite a significant campaign by Green Party members because it is very close to our values,” she said. The Irish Times poll also showed that 53 per cent of respondents knew “hardly anything” about the referendums. Asked if he was concerned this would bolster the No side, party leader Eamon Ryan said: “I think we need to use this next month to really have a debate in our country.” He added: “A month is a long time in politics. It does require the political parties to get out and make the case ... I think what’s really important is we do get people out to vote Yes-Yes.” Mr O’Gorman said that the central argument of the Green Party, the Government and the Yes side is that the values currently set out in Article 41 of the Constitution “don’t meet our values as a nation”. He said it “excludes tens of thousands of families from ... the protection of being recognised as a family because they’re not a marital family” and “sets out a very limited role for women in terms of a woman’s life in the home”. He said the care referendum proposal is to delete the “outdated language about a woman’s life within the home” and replace it with a new article that recognises care within the family. Some critics of the wording have argued that care outside the home should also be recognised and that the new provision does not place enough of an obligation on the State to support care. Mr O’Gorman argued that the proposed change does place a new obligation on the State to support care within families through new wording that says the State “shall strive to support such provision”. He said this would have to be factored into budget and Cabinet decisions. Elsewhere, Fine Gael Minister Simon Harris expressed confidence the very substantial number of “don’t knows” in The Irish Times poll – 27 per cent for the family referendum and 23 per cent for care – will greatly reduce over the coming weeks. The Minister for Further and Higher Education said he was not taking anything for granted in relation to the likely result but that he regarded the poll’s results so far as pointing in the right direction. Mr Harris said he was encouraged by the figures in the poll showing majorities for Yes votes but added: “I’m also in politics long enough to know that the closer you get to a referendum, that’s more likely when people start to give the issues consideration. “People are really busy; busy going about their own lives when a referendum is still a number of weeks [away], but people will probably sit down and give it more consideration [as it gets closer].”",0,1
2024/3/1,"Darragh O’Brien accused of misleading Dáil during homelessness debate  Minister for Housing ‘rejects outright’ assertion he would deliberately or otherwise mislead anyone Sinn Féin has accused Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien of misleading the Dáil over the number of people in emergency accommodation who are eligible for social housing. Last month, Mr O’Brien told the Dáil during a debate on homelessness that 42 per cent of people in emergency housing in Dublin were not eligible for social housing, one of the main exit routes through which people leave emergency accommodation. However, a report commissioned by Mr O’Brien’s department and obtained by Sinn Féin’s housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin suggests that many of those people are yet to have their eligibility assessed, and may ultimately be able to get access to social housing. Mr Ó Broin said the Fianna Fáil Minister had created the impression that large numbers of those in emergency accommodation were not eligible for social housing and “therefore he has no responsibility for assisting them to exit emergency accommodation”. The Sinn Féin deputy’s comments drew a sharp response from Mr O’Brien, who said he “rejected outright” the assertion he would deliberately or otherwise mislead anyone. He said he would “not take lessons” from Sinn Féin, accusing them of “playing both sides of the fence” on housing, arguing that the party regularly objects to housing while demanding more homes be built. The report, compiled last November and based on a survey by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE), found that 43.5 per cent of people on the night in question did not have an active social housing application. While this means they did not have an option to move out of emergency accommodation and into social housing on the night the survey was undertaken, Mr Ó Broin said their ultimate eligibility would not yet have been determined, with many still in the process of being assessed or preparing an application. “Minister O’Brien knowingly misled the Dáil when he claimed that over 40 per cent of people in emergency accommodation in Dublin do not have an entitlement to social housing. The report from the DRHE does not say this and the Minister knows that,” Mr Ó Broin said. “What it clearly shows is they don’t have an active social housing file, however many are waiting to be approved or have not yet applied, and many of them will ultimately be deemed eligible for social housing.” The DRHE report shows that 30 households or 0.5 per cent of those in emergency housing in Dublin have withdrawn from the process or have been rejected in their application for social housing – a number which Sinn Féin says is more reflective of the level of ineligibility within homeless services at the time the survey was done. Dublin West TD Mr Ó Broin contended that the majority of those in emergency accommodation without an active social housing application – which means that they have been assessed and approved as eligible – would have applications pending, or be working to gather information as part of the application process. “Unfortunately, due to the chronic understaffing of our local authorities, it can take six months or more to process these applications,” he said. In a statement, Mr O’Brien said the report showed that 43.5 per cent of people surveyed had no entitlement to social housing supports at the time it was taken. “It’s important to note that it was the Department which sought this information from the Dublin local authorities in the first instance as local authorities have expressed concerns in relation to exit pathways for those without a legal entitlement to reside in the State, or those who do not qualify for social housing. Improving our data gathering will result in better insights and informed solutions.” Mr Ó Broin also warned that the Minister should be careful in how he presents housing information in a climate where far-right misinformation has resulted in arson attacks against buildings intended for use as emergency homeless accommodation.",0,1
2024/3/1,"Ireland welcomes EU decision to continue Unrwa funding The commission said on Friday that it would proceed with paying €50 million of its €82 million envelope towards the agency next week Ireland has welcomed the European Commission’s decision to release funding to the UN’s Palestinian aid agency. The commission said on Friday that it would proceed with paying €50 million of its €82 million envelope towards the agency next week and increase emergency support to Palestinians by €68 million this year by funding other organisations. It had also allocated €125 million of humanitarian aid for Palestinians this year and contracted the first €16 million of this package on Friday. More than a dozen countries suspended funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (Unrwa) after allegations that 12 of its 13,000 Gaza staff members participated in the October 7th Hamas attacks. The commission had originally been due to give €82 million to Unrwa on Thursday but wanted the agency to accept its terms for an audit. The aid organisation has told the commission that it agreed to the launch of an audit to be conducted by EU-appointed external experts. Ireland, which provided €20 million in core funding to Unrwa last month, had repeatedly called for other states to continue financially supporting the agency. On Friday,  Tánaiste Micheál Martin welcomed the commission’s continuation of funding which he described as “urgently needed” by the Palestinian people. In a statement, Mr Martin said: “After four-and-a-half months of relentless violence and displacement, civilians in Gaza are living in conditions that no human being should have to endure. “Against this backdrop, the role and mandate of Unrwa is more important than ever. It is the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza. “It is clear that Unrwa is the one organisation that has the bandwidth and capacity to provide services and distribute aid comprehensively across Gaza and the wider region.” Mr Martin, also responsible for foreign affairs, said he welcomed engagement between the UN and the commission on investigating the allegations against Unrwa staff. He said it was essential that all UN member states co-operated in full with the investigation and the review. Mr Martin said: “This is a critical moment – for desperate civilians in Gaza, and for the stability of the wider region. “The international community needs to step up now to support Unrwa, so it can fulfil its vital and life-saving mandate.” - PA",0,1
2024/3/10,"Mr Varadkar goes to Washington: Is the Taoiseach’s St Patrick’s Day trip to the US really worth it? Ireland’s easy access to and close relationship with the most powerful nation on Earth remains a huge diplomatic asset If you’re Irish, come into the parlour – and the Oval Office and the Cabinet Room and the Lincoln Bedroom. If the weather is blustery and changeable, then it must be St Patrick’s Day and with the traditional diplomatic raid on Washington DC comes the usual agonising over whether or not the tradition has reached its sell-by date. “How many different ways can you accept a bowl of shamrocks, or celebrate the sterling qualities of the noble Irish people?” former George W Bush speech writer Matthew Scully despaired in a lighthearted New York Times piece in 2005. It seemed a reasonable question then and is just as reasonable to those who regard the entire charade with a cynical or dubious eye. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar flies out to the US on Monday for the first engagement of his annual St Patrick’s Day visit: an event at the JFK Presidential Library and Museum in Boston that evening. He moves on to Washington DC on Wednesday and, on Friday, will have his Oval Office meeting with US president Joe Biden at the White House before heading to Capitol Hill to rub shoulders with the president and US congressional leaders, a rare occasion in Washington’s political calendar when Democrats and Republicans mix socially. Varadkar will return to the White House on Sunday, St Patrick’s Day, for the more informal shamrock ceremony. Calls in Ireland for the Government to skip this year’s event as a gesture of protest over the situation in Gaza, which has been subjected to a months-long military attack by US ally Israel, have been ignored. And there are the usual grumblings about the expense of flying the Taoiseach and travelling party across the Atlantic for what from a transatlantic distance can look like a fireside chuckle. “That kind of utter small-mindedness I have no time for,” says Brendan O’Leary, Lauder professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania. “I would much rather the Taoiseach and ministers flew business class and had a good’s night sleep and were effective lobbyists rather than if they flew economy and were wrecked. I think Ireland vastly underestimates the cheapness of effective access to the greatest power on Earth. “Whether you like that power or not is immaterial. If you are a small country, you have to deal with the fact that the United States is the greatest single power on Earth and the fact that we have influence and a set of politicians who are willing to listen to our interests is just remarkable. It should never be neglected or underestimated in its importance.” O’Leary points to how the British “did not understand” how Democratic congressman Richie Neal of Massachusetts, a co-chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland caucus, was a “key player in Congress” and how Ireland’s close diplomatic ties with the US were “very evident” during the Brexit controversy. “No trade agreement can be made without his say-so,” said the academic of the US congressman. Ireland’s phenomenal annual access to the White House is at least in part a consequence of the historical precedent which saw the Irish establish themselves as what O’Leary terms “the best organised ethnic group in the United States at pursuing ethnic agenda questions”. When Dan Mulhall was appointed Irish ambassador to the US, he had plenty of people assuring him that the Irish-American tradition was “a wasting asset”, that the story was in decline. “And I didn’t find that at all,” he says now. “I was surprised in a positive way by the extent to which Irish Americans have this connection to Ireland and by their affinity with us. Of course, there is no guarantee it goes on forever, but I am impressed by the extent to which people still have that grá for Ireland. So those who are cynical, I feel, are getting it wrong. He thinks it would be “very foolish to spurn” the opportunity and is “delighted” that the Government has “ignored these calls to give a wide berth to Washington over Gaza”. Mulhall’s first St Patrick’s Day in Washington involved a visit to the then president Donald Trump, whose administration was full of officials who identified as Irish American. They included Mike Pence, Trump’s vice-president who had two grandparents born in Ireland. The style and theme of Irish-American politics now dominate American politics. Rival Irish Americans even sometimes express their political differences in a parallel row over authentic Irishness. The Catholic overseers of the St Patrick’s Day parade in New York barred gay Irish Americans until recently. Progressive Irish Americans hammer restrictionists such as Steve Bannon, Trump’s former strategist, for betraying their migrant history. This might be considered the final stage of the Irish triumph in America; the blarneyfication of its democracy. It could be argued that the origins of the White House presentation are a happy crash. The presentation of the cluster of shamrock was initiated by ambassador John Hearne, who delivered a box rather than the crystal bowl, for then president Harry Truman. That year, Truman was not at the White House but was appreciative of the gesture. In 1948, Truman was the first US president to attend the St Patrick’s Day parade in New York. And it started something. “I don’t want to say it fell into their lap because they came up with the idea,” Dr John Gibney of the Royal Irish Academy and an editor on the RIA’s Documents on Irish Foreign Policy series. “It didn’t start in 1952: St. Patrick’s Day was always the national day, and it was always part of their calendar and it seemed to build through incremental steps and Hearne giving the bowl set a precedent.” Dr Gibney said that by the time John F Kennedy was in the White House, St Patrick’s Day was “a fixture” in the presidential calendar. By the 1990s, Irish ambassador Dermot Gallagher was sufficiently in tune with the importance of the occasion that he held the view that the White House presentation should be made by the Taoiseach and suggested this to Albert Reynolds, which established a precedent. Some presidents, most notably Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Biden, always exhibited a strong personal pride in their Irish connection. Biden wears his affection for and fascination with Ireland as a badge of honour. The annual meeting of taoiseach and president in the White House stands as a crossing point between historical and familial connections. It captures the oft told, dewy eyed tale of the Irish in America, the practical and mutual benefits of American investment in Ireland and, more recently, of Irish investment in US business. As an ethnic group, Irish America remains potent and significant to the political interests of both countries. Plus, it has always been a terrific spot for a good old-fashioned whip-round. “The story Conor O’Clery tells in The Greening of the White House – that Irish Americans are now, on average, rich – is broadly true,” says Brendan O’Leary. “The wealth of Irish America is extraordinary. And if it can be tapped for pro-Irish purposes, that’s very useful.” He notes that it was once the case that Fianna Fáil was the richest Irish party because of the party’s friends in the United States but suspects that this “has long been superseded by Friends of Sinn Féin”. “So, Irish America has always mattered to Irish political parties, and it remains significant today,” says O’Leary. “The truth is that Ireland, along with Israel, has a remarkable special relationship with the United States for what is a tiny country. It is an amazing phenomenon that an American president would set this time aside for a tiny country.”",0,1
2024/3/10,"Referendum profiles: The No campaign’s key players and moments Spoils of victory have been picked up by those individuals and groups who urged the public to mark X in their No columns The manner of the defeats of the family and care referendums has left plenty of political egg on face to go around. The proposals had the backing of the three Government parties as well as Sinn Féin, most of the rest of the Opposition and a range of well-known campaign groups, but this ultimately counted for little. Instead, the spoils of victory have been picked up by individuals and groups who urged the public to check the No columns of their ballot papers on Friday. But who are they, and what were their key moments during the campaign? A well-known, albeit sometimes polarising political figure, Senator Michael McDowell was possibly the No side’s most effective performer. Having previously served as attorney general, minister for justice and tánaiste, he holds significant political pedigree and his intellectual horsepower on constitutional matters is well-established. It appears this resonated with voters, who were fed a steady drip of McDowell’s opinions on the airwaves and on the pages of the country’s newspapers right the way through the campaign. In particular, his interventions and raising of questions about whether “throuples” would be deemed “durable relationships” seem to have struck a chord. The former Progressive Democrats leader dismantled one of the central tenets of the Yes campaign – the argument that the present article 41.2 is a “stereotypical reference to women’s place in the home”. McDowell rejected this as simply “untrue” in a column for The Irish Times, replete with convincing sourcing to back up his argument. He pointed out that former chief justice Susan Denham had previously said “article 41.2 does not assign women to a domestic role”. “Article 41.2 recognises the significant role played by wives and mothers in the home,” she said. “This recognition and acknowledgment does not exclude women and mothers from other roles and activities.” The Aontú leader, the party’s solitary representative in the Oireachtas, has enjoyed a timely moment in the sun during these campaigns, with local and European elections coming around the corner. In 2018, the Meath West TD, regarded as a social conservative, left the Sinn Féin ranks due to differences of opinion ahead of the referendum that year on repealing the constitutional ban on abortion. That vote went against his position, but he went on to found Aontú and held his Dáil seat. Aontú was the only party to push for a No-No vote, and Tóibín has been quick to point out that his party  may have a better grasp of public sentiment than its more established rivals, albeit a conclusion made on the basis of these two rather confined issues. Aontú says it stands for “life, unity and economic justice in Ireland”. The weekend’s results will give him hope that there is a not insignificant constituency on the same page as his party, on some issues at least. Tóibín was instrumental in portraying the message during this campaign that unintended consequences could follow Yes votes, which appears to have struck a chord with some voters. He made the point that recognising “durable relationships” could result in a “solicitors’ paradise”. Speaking privately, one Government figure who was fresh from canvassing this week said the arguments being put forward by Senator Tom Clonan on the care referendum had really cut through with the public. Clonan argued that the proposed article 42B “gives constitutional expression to an ableist view that disabled citizens must rely on family members for care – and deliberately excludes the right to an independent, autonomous life in the community”. His arguments resonated deeply with some, and he performed well in debates which gave further heft to the No campaign. Clonan was elected to Seanad Éireann in March 2022. He is a carer for his son Eoghan, a third-level student who has a neuromuscular disease and is a wheelchair user. He is also well regarded for his work as an Army whistleblower on gender-based violence, and as a campaigner for the rights of people with disabilities. He is a strong advocate for Irish military neutrality. This was not a first referendum campaign for Maria Steen, a full-time homemaker with links to the conservative Iona Institute think-tank, which  campaigned against same-sex marriage and the liberalisation of Ireland’s abortion laws in the not-so-distant past. She put in an impressive performance for the No side during an RTÉ Prime Time debate in the run-up to the abortion referendum, with some saying she had been more successful than many other repeal opponents at winning over some of the undecided. Her main intervention during the latest campaign  again came during a Prime Time debate, this time facing off against Tánaiste Micheál Martin, whom most observers agreed had  a poor night. In one bad-tempered exchange, Martin accused Steen of having been a “prophet of doom” in previous referendum campaigns, while Steen retorted that Martin had failed to do anything to make it easier for mothers who wished to stay at home to do so. Flac – the free legal advice centres – is an independent, voluntary organisation, with the stated aim to “promote equal access to justice for everybody”. A legal analysis carried out by Flac on the referendum proposals led to it supporting the proposed “family” amendment, but not the “ineffective” and “implicitly sexist” amendment on carers. In a campaign where the Yes side put heavy emphasis on the importance of the public consuming clean information from reliable sources, this was a bitter blow for the campaign to take. Flac seeks to open up access to the courts and legal mechanisms of the State to ordinary citizens, many of whom would ordinarily baulk at the complexity of the language and systems underpinning Ireland’s legal system. It said it would not be engaging in campaigning – something which may have given its position further credibility in some circles – but argued the care amendment was unlikely to provide carers or people with disabilities with new enforceable rights or improved services. Flac further added that the proposal would give constitutional expression to “harmful stereotypes” in care provision, and that it “potentially compromises” the rights of people with disabilities. Equality not Care was set up specifically to campaign for a No vote in the care referendum. During its launch at Buswells Hotel in Dublin, it said it was made up of “concerned citizens”, disabled people and their family members who provide support. The group said it was  currently self-funded. Equality not Care described the amendment as ageist and ableist, saying it discriminated against disabled people and their family members. It said it would perpetuate the notion of people with impairments being burdens on families rather than equal rights holders. Instead, it called for a referendum that “expresses a modern interpretation of equality of the sexes with due regard for intersectionality” as protected in Ireland’s equality legislation. Of the amendment and proposed insertion of a new article, its spokeswoman Ann Marie Flanagan said: “42B seeks to deny our autonomy, dignity and equality”, adding that it “also seeks to deny us the right to State support such as personal assistance services”. Flanagan describes herself as a disabled human rights feminist, and climate and social justice activist. Michael O’Dowd, an Aontú representative in Co Louth and previously a Renua candidate, said the wording failed to “fulfil the comprehensive support promised” by the Citizens’ Assembly on Gender Equality, which recommended the referendum. The group had no collective position on the family referendum.",0,1
2024/3/11,"Paschal Donohoe’s prospect of International Monetary Fund top job slips away  EU finance ministers are set to endorse the head of the IMF, Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva, for a second term Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe is likely to remain in his job until the next election as EU finance ministers are set to endorse the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva, for a second term. Mr Donohoe had been touted as a possible successor for the role at the IMF, one of the most important jobs in international finance, and is understood to have held preliminary discussions with figures in Washington late last year. But sources in Brussels confirmed on Monday that EU finance ministers, who meet in Brussels on Tuesday, will confirm their support for a second term for Ms Georgieva. Mr Donohoe is currently in Brussels, where he is chairing a meeting of the Eurogroup finance ministers – from the countries which use the single currency – in his capacity as head of that group. “It’s over. She will get it,” said one senior source. European countries normally nominate the head of the IMF so the renewed support for Ms Georgieva is expected to be decisive. It is understood that she secured pivotal French backing for a second term. The news will come as a relief for the Government, which faced the prospects of losing one of its most important members before its last budget and the general election due afterwards in either late autumn or next spring. Mr Donohoe, as well as being vastly experienced, forms an important cross party link with the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance Michael McGrath. Speaking in Brussels on Monday, Mr Donohoe said his focus was on his work as a member of the Dáil, and he did not believe there would be a potential vacancy in the role as head of the IMF. “Kristalina Georgieva has done an excellent job,” he said.",0,1

The traditional high-level political engagements in Washington DC will take place on Friday, March 15th. The Taoiseach will meet bilaterally with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the speaker of the US House of Representatives. Discussions are expected to cover a broad agenda of issues including the deep ties between the United States and Ireland as the countries mark 100 years of diplomatic relations; and shared global challenges, including the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East. The meeting will also be an opportunity for the Taoiseach to thank Mr Biden for the ongoing US commitment to the Belfast Agreement and to welcome the restoration of the Northern Ireland institutions.  In Boston on Monday, the Taoiseach will meet the governor of the state of Massachusetts, Maura Healy, and will also deliver a keynote address at the President John F. Kennedy library, reflecting on the life and legacy of the late president and how his legacy continues to have lessons for the global challenges of today. On Tuesday, March 12th, the Taoiseach will start the day with a number of economic meetings and a visit to Fenway Park, the home of the Boston Red Sox, to announce a major investment by Irish company Output Sports, which specialises in sports data. Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr Varadkar said: “St. Patrick’s Day is a moment to reconnect with the 70 million people worldwide of Irish background, and not least the over 30 million in the US of Irish heritage.  “As we mark the centenary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Ireland and the US, I am looking forward to visiting Boston and Washington to celebrate this strong and enduring relationship. “My visit will aim to further strengthen the ties that link our two nations with a focus on economic, political and people-to-people connections,” he said.  “The Government’s theme for St. Patrick’s Day 2024 is ‘Ireland’s future in the world’ so this year I wish to celebrate the achievements of our young diaspora leaders in the US across the fields of innovation, creativity, community development, business, and academia. “Many of the events in both Boston and Washington DC will enable me to recognise their invaluable contribution to sustaining and deepening the close bonds between Ireland and the US, now and into the future,” Mr Varadkar said.",0,1
2024/3/11,"‘A matter of life and death’: Michael D Higgins condemns obstruction of aid entering Gaza President says ‘propaganda campaign’ against United Nations and its relief agency in enclave a ‘scandalous travesty’ President Michael D Higgins has strongly condemned the obstruction of aid entering the Gaza Strip by “state actions and illegal blockages”, calling on those responsible for preventing the deliverance of vital supplies to “take responsibility for the deaths that are ensuing”. In a strongly-worded statement published on Monday evening, Mr Higgins called for the blockading of food and aid to be stopped immediately: “It is a matter of life and death.” In recent weeks, reports have emerged of widespread starvation in the enclave, particularly in northern Gaza. A World Health Organisation (WHO) study warned last month that one in six children in the north are acutely malnourished. Since the outbreak of war in Gaza last year, Israel has been accused of blocking aid from entering the Gaza Strip. In late February, Human Rights Watch said that the Israeli government was obstructing aid entering the enclave in violation of an order from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague. Israel has denied restricting the entry of aid into Gaza. In his statement, Mr Higgins said that the blocking of aid by “state actions and illegal blockages breaches every humanitarian principle”. “Some of the worst scenes of starvation are being seen in those parts of northern and central Gaza where Israel has declared its military campaign complete,” he said. Mr Higgins also condemned a “propaganda campaign” against the United Nations (UN) and the work of Unrwa, a UN relief agency operating in Gaza. Mr Higgins referenced comments made by Philippe Lazzarini, head of Unrwa, who last week condemned a campaign of misinformation aimed at tarnishing the reputation of the agency. “The releasing of a propaganda campaign against the United Nations is a scandalous travesty against the little less than heroic efforts of all those involved on the frontline in Gaza – medical staff, those working to supply nutrition and aid in the most trying of circumstances, and those other dedicated professionals in Unrwa who have lost more than 160 of their colleagues,” he said. In recent months, several nations – including the United States – halted their funding on Unrwa, after Israel accused at least 12 of the agency’s employees of participating in the October 7th attacks, when roughly 1,200 Israeli were killed in Hamas-led assaults across southern Israel. “Those countries, and they include some of the strongest economies in the world, who have removed over $450m from the Unrwa budget must take account of what is now being shown on the television screens of the world for all to see – infant children dying from lack of oxygen, many more dying from malnutrition and all of this set to escalate,” Mr Higgins said. In recent days, Canada and Sweden have resumed aid to Unrwa. In the wake of the Unrwa allegations and subsequent pulling of funding by some countries, Tánaiste Micheál Martin pledged that Ireland would contribute €20 million to the agency. Mr Higgins said that it was “past time” that EU counterparts and other countries joined Ireland in calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. He also called for Israeli hostages held by Hamas to be released. “As the world watches Gaza descend yet deeper towards famine and ever greater loss of life, it is vital that every country in the world now does all in its power to ensure that a humanitarian disaster in its most extreme sense is avoided,” Mr Higgins said. “Once a ceasefire has been achieved, there is no time to be lost in addressing such basic issues as will be needed in order to bring a long-term peace which can provide both for the rights of Palestinians and for the appropriate security of Israel. “It is time for the world to put an end to this loss of life, to remember our shared humanity, listen to the peacemakers and commit all of its efforts to bringing this crisis to an end and ensuring an appropriate long term settlement is reached,” he concluded. Since the beginning of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza last year, over 31,000 Palestinians – mostly women and children – have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Meanwhile, a number of Irish artists have pulled out of the SXSW festival in solidarity with the people of Gaza, citing the US army’s sponsorship of the Austin, Texas event. Irish language rap group Kneecap, as well as bands Soda Blonde and Sprints, also cited the presence of a subsidiary company of weapons manufacturer RTX Corporation at SXSW as a reason for cancelling appearances at the film, media, music and culture festival. Singer songwriter Gavin James also announced that he would pull out of the festival.",0,1
2024/3/12,"NI Secretary emphasises need for US investment despite Legacy Act rift  Chris Heaton-Harris concedes ‘significant parting of the ways’ over ‘premature’ legal challenge mounted by Dublin  Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Chris Heaton-Harris has insisted the “friction” between London and Dublin over the British government’s controversial Troubles Legacy Act will not affect a joint bid for US investment into Northern Ireland this week. Speaking in advance of his trip to Washington DC for political and economic engagements before the annual St Patrick’s Day White House ceremony, Mr Heaton-Harris admitted a “significant parting of ways” over the legal challenge mounted by the Irish Government in the European Court of Human Rights earlier this year to the British legislation. “I absolutely profoundly regret the decision taken by the Irish Government to bring what I perceive to be an unnecessary interstate case against the UK government,” Mr Heaton-Harris told The Irish Times. “I just think the case was premature, it didn’t need to happen when it happened.” Last month, a High Court judge in Belfast ruled that the central plank of the Legacy Act — an offer of conditional immunity from prosecutions for Troubles-related killings — is in breach of international human rights law. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said at the time that the judgment was “not a surprise” as it “reflected and underpinned” the course of action which the Irish Government had taken. However, Mr Justice Colton also found that the investigative body set up under the legislation, the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR), had sufficient independence and powers to effectively investigate deaths and offences linked to the 30-year conflict. Mr Heaton-Harris said that while in Washington, he will continue to “press the case” for the Irish Government to “engage with the ICRIR”. Asked to react to the comments, a Department for Foreign Affairs spokesman noted the outcome of the High Court ruling, “in particular its immunity provisions, is not compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights”. “Regarding the ICRIR established by the Legacy Act, the Government’s concerns about the Act’s compliance with the convention are now before the European Court of Human Rights. It is for the court to make a determination and we will not litigate the case in the media,” he said. Despite the fallout, relations are “good in general” between the two sides, according to the Northern Secretary and the initial focus of the US trip will be attracting American companies to invest in the North following the restoration of Stormont. “Forgive me for not being as negative about the relationship between the government of the UK and the Government of the Republic of Ireland because I’ve been in politics for a period of time — all relationships have interesting points in them,” he added. “I’ve got a really good personal relationship with my main interlocutor, the Tánaiste. I know that together we’re going to be making quite a case for inward investment to Northern Ireland because it benefits everybody — so hopefully with the element of friction people see, they’ll also be able to see how we can work together.” The US trip follows the publication of the long-awaited interim report on the activities of the British army top IRA spy during the Troubles, code-named Stakeknife. The damning Operation Kenova inquiry concluded that the double agent, widely identified as Belfast IRA member Freddie Scappaticci, cost more lives than he saved. One of its main recommendations was a call for the UK government and republican leadership to apologise “for failing to prevent torture and murder of suspected informants”. Mr Heaton-Harris confirmed he had read the 207-page report but said his position remains the same as last week, in that the UK government will not comment until the final version of Kenova is released. “Cases relating to Operation Kenova still remain under consideration by the courts. I have learned over time that it’s completely inappropriate for me or the government to make comment on the substance of the interim report until we’ve concluded all the relevant litigation,” he said. The Northern Secretary also refused to be drawn on British government funding towards the Casement Park redevelopment in advance of the Euro 2028 soccer tournament until the final cost is determined by Stormont’s Department for the Communities. “I am unbelievably keen to see games at Casement and see Euro games played in a redeveloped stadium there,” he said. “There is no blank cheque for these sort of things; this is public money and choices have to be made. “I am actually hopeful but it needs full and final figures to be more concrete than they are at this point.”",0,1
2024/3/13,"Fianna Fáil Limerick mayoral candidate who criticised Micheál Martin says her views have ‘evolved’ Dee Ryan, who questioned the Tánaiste’s leadership on social media in 2016 and 2017, says her view of him now ‘could not be more positive’ Fianna Fáil’s candidate to become the first directly elected mayor of Limerick has insisted her view of Micheál Martin “could not be more positive” after the emergence of old social media posts where she criticised him and the party. Dee Ryan said she was previously a member of other political parties but “my opinions have been my own and I’ve no difficulty in saying that they have evolved”. Mr Martin and Limerick TDs Minister of State Niall Collins TD and Willie O’Dea were on hand when Ms Ryan was named as Fianna Fáil’s candidate for June’s election last Monday. Ms Ryan was the chief executive of Limerick Chamber for six years. She announced her resignation from the role this week as she embarks on her election campaign although she will remain in place during a four-week transition period. The Ditch website reported on Tuesday that Ms Ryan had previously criticised Fianna Fáil and Mr Martin on Twitter, now called X, in posts that were published several years ago. In one post during a 2016 election debate she said that then Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny “had facts & figures at fingertips” and was a “#rockofsense”. She added in the post: “M. Martin sooo #notaleader”. She also shared Fine Gael posts in 2016 that criticised Fianna Fáil over the fallout from the 2008 economic crash. In a 2017 post she wrote that Fianna Fáil TD Barry Cowen was “criticising Govt work cleaning up #fiannafail mess” saying it is “easier to criticise than find solutions” and “opp [opposition] suits FF”. Ms Ryan was a member of Fine Gael at the time of the social media posts. In a statement on Wednesday Ms Ryan said: “My opinion of Fianna Fáil and Tánaiste Micheál Martin, particularly through his leadership, today could not be more positive. “I’ve been very impressed by his and the party’s strong leadership since re-entering Government four years ago, not least in guiding the country through the challenging pandemic.” She added: “When it came to my candidacy for mayor I felt Fianna Fáil with party values of fairness and equity, was the best fit for me.” Ms Ryan also said: “As Taoiseach and now Tánaiste, Micheál Martin has presided over a Government that not alone maintained economic stability but returned the country to remarkable growth, albeit with much still to do and, moreover, with an appetite to do it.” She said: “I am passionate about politics and have been for many years and I’ve been a member of other political parties, but my opinions have been my own and I’ve no difficulty in saying that they have evolved.” Ms Ryan added: “I remain unafraid to speak my mind and if the people of Limerick choose to do me the honour of electing me as their Mayor, I can assure them that I will be a strong voice in pursuit of our shared agenda to make Limerick a better place for all its citizens.” Separately Social Democrats councillor Elisa O’Donovan announced on Wednesday that she will be her party’s candidate in the mayoral election. She said: “I am hugely ambitious for Limerick and its future. I know that, with the right leadership, Limerick can thrive and become the best place in Ireland to live.” Other candidates already in the field include former Department of Finance secretary general John Moran and Green Party TD Brian Leddin.",0,1
2024/3/13,"Fianna Fáil European Parliament group to decide nominee for Commission presidency next week Ursula von der Leyen seeking second five-year term but is facing opposition backlash over support for Israel Fianna Fáil’s European Parliament group, Renew Europe, will decide next week on their nominee for the presidency of the European Commission (EC). The 108 MEPs in the group, which includes Irish MEPs and party members Barry Andrews and Billy Kelleher, will meet at a special two-day annual congress in Brussels where it will choose between three candidates: Mr Andrews, Fianna Fáil Dublin MEP, said the matter had not been discussed at party level but he will be voting for Ms Hayer, a “very solid” candidate. He added however that while the Council of Europe leaders has to “give a nod” to the European Parliament “we don’t have the right to nominate the commission president”. Fine Gael’s European People’s Party (EPP) group last week agreed on current president Ursula von der Leyen as its nominee for a second five-year term. Ms von der Leyen pledged unequivocal EU support for Israel’s right to defend itself during her visit there in the wake of the October 7th Hamas attack, and opposition parties have opposed her reappointment because of that unwavering backing. Negotiations on a new EC will only commence on June 10th after the European elections across the EU are completed between June 6th and 9th and member state leaders will make the decision, although the successful nominee will need an absolute majority in the parliament. Under the Spitzenkandidat process, an EU obsession that means little in member states, in the unlikely even any of Renew Europe’s three parties secures a majority coalition after the election they have a mandate for the presidency. The process was however ignored in 2019 when EU leaders chose Ms von der Leyen. Fianna Fáil Ireland South MEP Billy Kelleher stressed that governments nominate their commissioners based on their political policies and philosophy and the commission will not “automatically reflect the parliament”. Picking a nominee will however “give a figurehead to a campaign”, a person to represent the group’s philosophy. The Green Party’s European Free Alliance (EFA) group with 70 MEPs has nominated two candidates: Bas Eickhout (47) a Dutch member of the GreenLeft (stet) and an MEP since 2009; and Terry Reintke (36) a member of the German Greens and an MEP since 2014. Green Party Dublin MEP Ciaran Cuffe said while the EC president had signed the European green deal her very strong support of Israel on Gaza “has left a dark stain on the EU flag” and she is “completely unacceptable to us”. Last week in the Dáil Tánaiste Micheál Martin said “Ireland will conduct extensive consultations, both internally and with our European partners before deciding which nominee to support in the European Council”. Sinn Féin foreign affairs spokesman Matt Carthy said the EC president had “damaged the potential of the EU to play a constructive role” in the Middle East. Mr Martin said however she had changed position on funding the UN agency Unrwa and offered €50 million and in November she had clearly expressed the need to protect lives in Gaza and ensure humanitarian access. The Tánaiste added that “president von der Leyen has been a strong advocate for the protection of Irish interest throughout the Brexit process” and had provided leadership in the EU and support to Ireland during Covid.",0,1
2024/3/14,"Taoiseach insists he will not dilute Government’s criticism of Israel during US trip  Varadkar pledges  to maintain pressure over Gaza when meeting US president and Congressional leaders  The Taoiseach has said he is adamant he will not dilute the Irish Government’s strong stance on Gaza or Ukraine when meeting US president Joe Biden and other senior politicians in Washington DC this weekend. Leo Varadkar said he was mindful of the strong historic support for Israel in the US but indicated it would not deflect him from speaking out on the impact the ongoing Israeli attack on Gaza has had on its civilian population, particularly women and children. “I appreciate that there will be differences of opinions in relation to Israel and Gaza,” he said on Thursday in Washington DC. “There’s very strong historic support for Israel in the US, for lots of different reasons, but that’s not going to deflect me from saying what I feel needs to be said.” Mr Varadkar’s weeklong visit to the United States has been characterised by a series of speeches in which he has harshly criticised the Israeli conflict, honing in on particularly on the many thousands of Palestinian children who have been killed or severely injured. He has been similarly outspoken on the issue of Ukraine, strongly pledging its support to its effort to defend its territories in the face of the Russian invasion. Asked on Thursday whether he had tempered his message to a US audience, Mr Varadkar said he had not but was mindful of different perspectives with regards to the tone of his speeches. “Just to be very clear, there’s nothing I wouldn’t say here that I wouldn’t say back home or vice versa.,” he said. “Anytime you go anywhere in the world, you have to get the tone right and tailor the message for the audience that’s hearing it. “When I was in Bucharest last week at the (European People’s Party) congress I was speaking to German people or to Greek people and that was a bit different from when you’re speaking to somebody back home. “You have to be able to get the tone right, show that you can tailor the message in a way that people will hear and understand. That is the objective, to try to influence people.” He said he had been encouraged in Bucharest by people who had come up to him to thank him for raising his perspective and to confide they were increasingly uncomfortable with their own government’s position. “I didn’t expect it. So that kind of encouraged me to keep doing it,” he said. Asked if he had received any blowback from US politicians or audiences to his criticism of Israel, he said: “Not so far.” On the issue of Ukraine he was really encouraged by the response. “We need America in this battle to save Ukrainian sovereignty and independence,” he said. “If Ukraine falls, Putin will have another target ... “He will at some point test Nato, and the consequences for all of us will be very serious. So I’m very keen to use any opportunity I have to speak to US Congressional leaders in particular about getting the legislation passed to provide the funding and support for Ukraine that it needs.” Mr Varadkar said that the appearance on stage together during the Ireland Funds Gala dinner in Washington on Wednesday night of Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly was a highlight. “I have an abiding memory and that’s being whisked out of the Ireland Funds dinner in 2020 in the middle of the meal to be told that there was a meeting on Nphet under way and that the pandemic had come to Ireland, “I now have another abiding memory. And that’s from last night. Seeing the First Minister, and Deputy First Minister on the stage together was powerful, to make the speeches they made, demonstrating the great chemistry that they have. They’re working well together.” He said the Ireland Funds had raised $600 million for Ireland over the years and it was good for it to see the Good Friday Agreement working again. personified by Ms O’Neill and Ms Little-Pengelly. Mr Varadkar said he agreed with Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan that the makeshift campsite of between 100 and 200 tents clustered around the International Protection offices in Mount Street should be cleared. He said that the Government was not in a position at this moment in time to provide accommodation to those seeking asylum in Ireland but that Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman was doing his best to come up with solutions. “His team is working very hard to try to find some forms of shelter so, at the very least, we can get people off the streets.”",0,1
2024/3/14,"‘Safe third countries’: the asylum policy of Fine Gael’s European party and Varadkar’s view explained The European People’s Party has faced claims its asylum-applicant proposal mirrors the UK’s Rwanda policy Migration has been the focus of much political discussion at national and European levels. The European People’s Party (EPP) manifesto for the June European election has a focus on “illegal migration”. The proposals, which would see a significant change to the rules around asylum seekers, have received the support of Fine Gael MEPs and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Among the proposals is a policy that would see asylum applicants sent to a “safe third country” to be processed, and would be granted asylum in that country if approved. Mr Varadkar has said he supports “that approach”, with some caveats. But the policy is a long way from becoming reality in Ireland, which can choose to opt in or out of provisions. Here is an outline of what’s happening. The EPP is an umbrella group representing conservative and centre-right political parties in Europe, including Fine Gael. The group is topping the polls ahead of June’s European elections, and it is set to remain the European Parliament’s biggest faction after the vote. Furthermore, its lead candidate, Ursula von der Leyen, is a firm favourite to be re-elected European Commission president. According to its manifesto, published last week, the group advocates a “fundamental change in European asylum law” and that while it is “committed” to the right of asylum, the EU must “have the right to decide to whom and where it is granted”. “We will conclude agreements with third countries to ensure that asylum seekers can also be granted protection in a civilised and safe way. We want to implement the concept of safe third countries,” it said. “Anyone applying for asylum in the EU could also be transferred to a safe third country and undergo the asylum process there. In the case of a positive outcome, the safe third country will grant protection to the applicant onsite. A comprehensive contractual agreement will be established with the safe third country.” The EPP’s manifesto said the safe third countries must be in line with the “core obligations of the Geneva Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights”. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar denied it was the European equivalent of the UK policy because the safe countries will be identified under these conventions. The UK’s Rwanda deportation policy – which has not seen any migrants processed in the small, landlocked African nation yet – was deemed illegal by the country’s supreme court. Migration is something the EU has been trying to regularise in recent years. In December, the union reached a landmark agreement on new rules designed to share the cost and work of hosting migrants more evenly and to limit the numbers of people coming in. The reform includes faster vetting of irregular arrivals, creating border-detention centres, accelerated deportation for rejected asylum applicants and a solidarity mechanism for southern countries experiencing big numbers of international protection applicants. The overhaul, based on a commission proposal put forward more than three years ago, keeps the existing principle under which the first EU country that asylum seekers enter is responsible for their case. The Safe Third Country concept is already provided for under existing EU law and the new Pact on Migration and Asylum which is due to be finalised shortly at the EU level. However, an important condition in EU law is there must be a connection between the applicant and the third country - meaning it is not possible to send international protection applicants to a country to which they have never been and have no connection. Italy has made an agreement recently with Albania that people seeking asylum could be processed there. There is also an EU arrangement with Tunisia. Well, that depends. Ireland currently has no European Union obligation to take in refugees as it has an opt-in or opt-out clause on individual proposals in the areas of freedom, security and justice through the EU Treaty of Lisbon. When there is an EU legislative proposal in these areas, Ireland has three months to decide whether to opt in or not. If it does not opt in, discussions go ahead, and any adopted legislation does not apply in Ireland. Fine Gael MEPs and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar certainly have. The Taoiseach said there was a “very difficult situation now in Ireland” in relation to international protection applicants as the numbers are increasing, but the State “can’t guarantee people accommodation if they arrive”. Mr Varadkar said there were “increasing numbers coming over the Border from North to South which is an open border”. However, he said the Government was neither “dissuading or discouraging genuine refugees from coming to Ireland if they need international protection” nor “encouraging people to come to Ireland and claim asylum”. He added that poverty, climate change and war were push factors that were leading to the increase in the number of asylum seekers coming to Ireland. “There are 100 million people on the move around the world and it’s not a surprise that a very small percentage might make their way to Ireland.” According to data from the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA), asylum applications in the EU jumped 18 per cent to 1.14 million in 2023, the highest level since the 2015-2016 migrant crisis. While the 2023 asylum applications are just under 2016 levels, they come on top of the 4.4 million Ukrainians that have sought refuge from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in the European Union – and do not need to formally apply. This has created local tensions within member states as they struggle to accommodate the rising numbers of people seeking help. According to Mr Varadkar, there is a need to “make a distinction” between those migrating legally and those not abiding by the law. “We also need to be more firm [with] people who try to come to Ireland illegally as economic migrants when we have a work permit system that can be used,” he added.",0,1
2024/3/14,"Ethics watchdog had ‘no role’ to query State-funded NGO referendum spending Lack of independent scrutiny raises questions about spending of public money in family and care referendums New questions have been raised about the referendum campaigns of State-funded interest groups, after the public ethics watchdog said it had “no role” to examine their spending. The No side in the family and care referendums accused Ministers of using interest groups to fight a proxy Yes case for constitutional change. The proposals were emphatically defeated last Friday. The referendum amendments sought to widen the definition of family beyond those based on marriage and also sought to replace language around a woman’s life in the home with a provision recognising care within families. Yes campaigners, funded to the tune of millions of euro by the Government, insisted there was no breach of the ban on spending public money in referendums. But No campaigners Senator Michael McDowell and Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín said the lack of independent scrutiny raised questions about the McKenna ruling of the Supreme Court, which bans the spending of public money. The gap emerged when the Standards in Public Office Commission and the new Electoral Commission said they had no power to examine whether non-government organisations (NGOs) comply with the Supreme Court ruling. The ethics watchdog said: “While the Standards in Public Office Commission has a role under the Electoral Act 1997 in regard to third parties receiving donations for political purposes, including for a referendum campaign, it has no role concerning the expenditure of public monies by non-governmental organisations in the circumstances to which you refer.” Mr McDowell said there were “very serious issues” to be examined: “The McKenna principles would mean nothing if the Government can heavily subsidise campaigning bodies to act as referendum proxies.” Mr Tóibín called for new oversight by the watchdog, saying the influence of Government money in referendum campaigns “must be within the scrutiny of Sipo”. The National Women’s Council, whose Yes campaign was backed by 29 interest groups and trade unions, said it fully complied with “the legislation and regulations governing expenditure in referendums” and had a proven track record in previous votes. A spokesperson for Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman said he “believes that NGOs play an important role in holding Government to account on a range of issues, and indeed are regularly critical of Government”. The spokesperson added: “All NGOs were fully entitled to make their own decisions as to the positions they took on the proposed Constitutional amendments.”",0,1
2024/3/14,"Taoiseach say he does not expect more protests against Ukrainian refugee accommodation centres ‘We have not seen a large amount of protests, or difficulties that have arisen’ in terms of demonstrations, says Varadkar Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he does not expect any protests against the five new accommodation centres for Ukrainian refugees, the locations of which were announced on Wednesday. The centres will be located at Ballyogan Road, Dublin (392 beds), Stradbally, Co Laois (950 beds), Fernbank, Limerick (250 beds), Punchestown, Co Kildare (378 beds) and Gerald Griffin St, Cork (107 beds). Speaking in Boston on Wednesday during this weeklong visit to the US, Mr Varadkar said: “Those protests have been more often connected to people seeking International Protection, rather than those coming from Ukraine. “I think nobody is arguing with the fact that people are coming from Ukraine or coming from a country that is at war and facing hardship. There is, rightly or wrongly, a greater understanding as to why we need to assist Ukrainians than perhaps there is in the case for International Protection applicants, many of whom are refused protection.” Mr Varadkar was speaking at Boston Airport before his departure to Washington DC, where he will meet US president Joe Biden later this week. Asked about the report in The Irish Times that as many as 200 men seeking international protection were sleeping in a makeshift camp in Dublin city centre, with some affected by scabies, Mr Varadkar said he was aware of the situation and had passed the camp on a number of occasions. “I have seen it with my own eyes,” he said. “We are doing all that we can to find additional accommodation. That is a real struggle at the moment and we are prioritising women and families, and men with particular vulnerabilities,” he said. Mr Varadkar argued that the context was that there had been a quadrupling in the number of people entering Ireland “irregularly” since 2019. “I would say to people who are thinking of coming to Ireland irregularly that if they are coming from a safe country where they have accommodation, we can’t guarantee you accommodation in Ireland. “Indeed it’s the same out here in America where they’re facing exactly the same problems. There are so many people on the move in the world. If you are passing through safe country, or if you have accommodation already in that country, whether it’s Britain or France or whichever transit country, we can’t guarantee accommodation any more and I just want to be honest about that,” he said. Speaking later in Washington, Mr Varadkar said that it was not a case of dissuading people from seeking International Protection in Ireland. “If they are genuinely entitled to international protection, we don’t dissuade them. I think what is very evident in all of Europe and the US that it is not the pull factors but the push factors. We are in a very difficult situation now in Ireland at the moment where we can’t guarantee people accommodation if they arrive in Ireland yet the numbers are increasing. There is a myth out there that we are somehow inviting people out there to claim asylum in Ireland. That is not the case. It is the push factors that are causing it.” Meanwhile, Mr Varadkar said that the prospects of a ceasefire in Gaza in the short-term looked increasingly unlikely but he would encourage President Biden to continue the efforts he is making to bring about a ceasefire on the ground. Mr Varadkar said he also wanted to talk to Mr Biden about the “day after” the conflict comes to an end. He said the plan of the Israeli government for Gaza the day after were “entirely unacceptable”. “It’s an occupied territory. It’s not Israel’s right to decide what happens in Gaza. America and Europe have a role to play in building a Palestinian state,” he said. Asked by reporters if this year’s traditional visit to the White House was difficult due to the US administration’s position on the Middle East conflict, Mr Varadkar said it presented a “new aspect” to the engagement. He said: “Obviously, in Gaza its catastrophic and a great concern. I have to say, I believe President Biden’s heart is in the right place there. “I know he’s working with Egypt, with Qatar, with Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region, the Jordanians, to try and get Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire,” Mr Varadkar said. “So I’m keen to hear from him what his perspective is, but also to put across the very strong view of the Irish people that there should be an immediate ceasefire, so the hostages can be released, so that medicine and food that’s desperately needed can get into Gaza. “But what we need beyond that is a pathway towards a just and lasting piece.”",0,1
2024/3/15,"Dublin’s migrant tent city ‘unacceptable’ and plan for refugees needed quickly, Harris says Minister for Higher Education urges Roderic O’Gorman to bring a long-term plan to Government People are “frustrated” with the time it is taking the Department of Integration to finalise a long-term plan to address accommodation shortages for refugees, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris has said. Mr Harris urged his Cabinet colleague, the Green Party Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman, to speed up delivery of a long-term plan to address the shortage of accommodation for refugees. Speaking at a St Patrick’s weekend event in London, the Fine Gael Minister suggested that it was “unacceptable” that refugees were left to sleep in “inhumane conditions” in tents in Dublin city centre. “We need to show the Irish people as quickly as possible what the plan is now when it comes to accommodation,” he said on Friday, as he visited the Irish Cultural Centre in Hammersmith, west London, where he met members of the Irish building community. He said the presence of refugees in more than 100 tents on the street near the International Protection office on Mount Street in Dublin showed the “urgent need” for a proper response, and also for speedy interim measures to improve conditions in the tent encampment in the short term. “Most people in Ireland appreciate how challenging this situation is. I do understand the scale of demand and the pressure the system is dealing with, but I also understand that people want to see Government respond,” said Mr Harris. “Irish people are getting understandably frustrated they haven’t yet seen a plan beyond the emergency response. I know Roderic O’Gorman works extremely hard on these issues. [But] I really hope that plan can come to Cabinet quickly.” A spokesman for Mr O’Gorman’s department said it was urgently working on “a solution which we hope will be put into operation as soon as possible”.  “We are not in a position to comment any further due to security considerations,” he said. The current situation is unsatisfactory and every effort is being made by the department to resolve it.” Mr Harris said that interim measures to alleviate the conditions faced by refugees in tents around Mount Street should focus on, for example, giving them better toilet and washing facilities. The refugees in tents must walk more than 20 minutes to use their designated toilet facilities. “I don’t think it is acceptable that [large numbers of tents are allowed to] spring up in an almost ad hoc manner. There needs to be some kind of interim solution found that, even if it’s not where we wish to be, at least people can be safe and have access to sanitation, and that it is more organised and less ad hoc.” Mr Harris agreed that the situation at Mount Street was an “emergency”.  But he rebuffed a suggestion that the apparent tolerance of it so far is evidence that the Government had run out of ideas or was exhausted. Fine Gael, his party, has been in power 13 years this month. “I have never been more energised. But now also with the benefit of significant experience. This must be the only job in the world where experience is presented as a negative. Experience is a good thing,” he said. There are currently 1,308 male international protection applicants who are without State-provided accommodation, according to the latest figures from the Department of Integration, published on Friday. A total of 1,897 single male asylum seekers have arrived into the State since December 4th, when the Government announced it was no longer able to guarantee accommodation for new arrivals. A total of 202 were offered accommodation after a vulnerability assessment, while a further 387 were offered accommodation at a later point",0,1
2024/3/15,"US working towards Ramadan ceasefire in Gaza, Biden tells Taoiseach  Disclosure comes during meeting in Oval Office in White House as part of Leo Varadkar’s St Patrick’s Day visit to the US  US president Joe Biden has told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar the US administration is working “very hard” towards a humanitarian ceasefire during the next few weeks. During a 30-minute meeting between both leaders in the Oval Office of the White House on Friday, Mr Varadkar said that Mr Biden  told him that the White House was pressing hard with countries in the Middle East, as well as using its influence with Israel, to put in place a ceasefire within a number of weeks. According to Mr Varadkar, Mr Biden said he wanted it to be put in place during Ramadan, the Muslim period of fasting that continues until April 9th. “I know the White House and the president are working very hard on that. If we can secure a humanitarian ceasefire, even for a few weeks to allow for hostages to be released and prisoners to be exchanged, that could be possible to build on that to something more permanent,” said Mr Varadkar to reporters afterwards. “Something good could come out of all the horror that we’ve seen in the past few months. There is the possibility of a comprehensive peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours and a two-state solution.” The US president and the Taoiseach gave a brief joint media conference in the Oval Office where Mr Biden agreed with Mr Varadkar’s comments on the need for a ceasefire and a long-term agreement on a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. Addressing Mr Biden, the Taoiseach said: “You know, my view [is] that we need to have a ceasefire as soon as possible to get food and medicine in, because we spoke about how we can make that happen and move towards a two-state solution, which I think is the only way we’ll have lasting peace and security.” As he spoke, Mr Biden nodded and said, “I agree,” when Mr Varadkar referred to the need for a ceasefire, and also when he spoke about a two-state solution. It came amid strong signals that the Biden administration is beginning to pivot from its strong support of Israel in the five-month war, with increasing concern about the very high death toll of Palestinian civilians. On Thursday, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish politician in US politics, called for a general election in Israel and severely criticised Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Responding to Mr Schumer’s speech, Mr Biden disclosed his officials had been made aware of what would be said. He said it was a good speech. “I think he expressed serious concern shared not only by him, but by many Americans,” said the president. During their meeting at the Oval Office as part of the Taoiseach’s St Patrick’s Day visit to the US, Mr Varadkar and Mr Biden discussed Irish-US relations, the war in Ukraine, the return of the institutions in Northern Ireland, and the war in Gaza. Earlier on Friday, the Taoiseach met US vice-president Kamala Harris at her official residence. Mr Varadkar was also the guest of honour at a lunch hosted by the speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, on Capitol Hill. Mr Varadkar said the issue of the US supplying weapons to Israel was discussed. This is an issue highlighted by former president Mary Robinson. “The US is very clear that it will continue to support Israel to defend itself,” Mr Varadkar said, but added: “None of us like to see the weapons being used where they are now.” Mrs Robinson had earlier urged the Taoiseach to use his meeting with the president  to “deliver a political message in a very direct way” and influence Israel to implement a ceasefire and open up Gaza to allow aid to get in. She said the US government should also get Israel to accept a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict. She also said Mr Varadkar should urge Mr Biden to stop the arms supply and “stop the money”. “I want the political message from the Taoiseach and from Irish representatives to be very clear,” Ms Robinson said, calling for an indefinite ceasefire and a move to a two-state solution.",0,1
2024/3/15,"Referendum wording chosen to ‘avoid a concrete and mandatory obligation’, files suggest Department of Finance records prompted No campaigner Michael McDowell to accuse the Coalition of misleading voters The Government is embroiled in a new referendum row after internal files suggest the care amendment wording was chosen to “avoid a concrete and mandatory obligation” on the State. The release of the Department of Finance records prompted No campaigner Senator Michael McDowell on Thursday to accuse the Coalition of misleading voters before the care and the family referendums were emphatically rejected one week ago. That charge was immediately rejected by Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman, who insisted the Government wanted “a requirement on the State to make serious and sustained efforts to support family care”. Ministers had insisted there were no taxation or immigration implications. But files showed officials grappling with tax issues and legal advice that said greater weight would be given to non-marital family rights “in childcare, immigration and social welfare”. The finance records, released first to Gript website, were covered by a Freedom of Information request from The Irish Times and provided to the paper by the department. The files showed officials saying measures such as those presented in the family referendum could create uncertainty because of the role foreseen for judges. Officials referred in favourable terms to early plans – dropped by the Government in the referendum proposal – for the Oireachtas to retain the power to define the new concept of family in law. “A failure to do this would leave it to the courts to determine the scope and limits of the family, with the result that the Government and the public would not have a clear understanding of, or political influence upon, the definition from one case to the next,” said a note to the Cabinet social policy committee. A 73.93 per cent majority rejected care amendments to “strive to support” care and delete mothers’ duties from the Constitution. A 67.69 per cent voted to reject family amendments to recognise families in “other durable relationships” in addition to marriage families. The finance records, released first to Gript website, were covered by a Freedom of Information request from The Irish Times. Some disability campaigners questioned the care proposal, believing it gave no new rights that could be asserted in court. But the Government said there would be an express obligation on the State to strive to support care. In a note to Minister for Finance Michael McGrath, officials contrasted the “strive” wording with proposals – which were not accepted – for “reasonable measures” to provide care: “In summary this option is intended to avoid a concrete and mandatory obligation to provide support as opposed to the previous ‘reasonable measures’ language.” Mr McDowell said people were misled. “Government spokespersons consistently misrepresented the substance of the legal advice that they were receiving from the AG and elsewhere [including apparently outside counsel],” he said. “They attempted to minimise or deny any practical implications for succession law, taxation law, immigration law, welfare law and childcare in a manner that the documentation proves was misleading.” Mr O’Gorman’s spokesman said: “The Minister rejects that assertion.” He added: “The article would have been positioned in the justiciable part of the Constitution and the courts, as the judicial arm of the State, would have been required to interpret and apply this article, as appropriate, in cases where the provision of support for family care is an issue.”",0,1
2024/3/15,"‘There will be differences of opinions’: Varadkar brings clear message on Gaza to US Taoiseach has spoken about Gaza every day during his weeklong visit to the US The first event for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on his weeklong visit to the United States was at the John F Kennedy Library, a stunning Camelot of light-filled glass overlooking Boston Harbour. His large audience on Monday evening was about as receptive as you will find in the US: Irish-American Democrats from the most Irish city on the continent. Unlike the mesmeric Kennedys, Varadkar is not a renowned orator. But on Monday he delivered arguably the most powerful speech he has made since becoming Taoiseach in 2017. It was about the horrendous human toll of what he described as Israel’s collective punishment of Gaza. Varadkar did not hold back and the words carried a strong resonance at home in Ireland and here in the US. “The cries of the innocent will haunt us forever if we stay silent,” he said. “The cries will engender more retaliation and beget more violence and revenge. No child ever gave their consent for terrorist acts. No child should ever be punished for them. “It is unconscionable that they are dying not just as a result of relentless bombing and destruction, but of hunger and thirst and from an absence of medical treatment and care.” Varadkar was given a standing ovation at the end of the overtly political speech but the reception was more polite than if the speech had been made in Ireland. Even among a sympathetic audience, the Government’s message on Israel and Gaza is a harder sell in the US. That said, it has not deflected Varadkar. The strategy on the Taoiseach’s part was deliberate, according to his officials. The Irish Government is determined to deliver a strong message calling for an immediate ceasefire. Varadkar’s speech was laying down a marker for what he would say later in the week to Congressional leaders and to the administration. The programme in Washington DC for a visiting taoiseach follows a template unaltered for many years. There is the visit to Capitol Hill to meet the leaders of both Houses, the meeting with the vice-president and the shamrock ceremony with the president. There is also a full programme of satellite events in the capital city promoting Irish commerce and culture. One of the key occasions is the influential Ireland Funds dinner in the National Buildings Museum where the Taoiseach was the guest of honour this year. He again brought up Gaza in his speech, saying that its civilians were being forced by Israel into “humiliation and starvation. And that is wrong”. Some of those in attendance were of the view that the response to his words were more muted than elsewhere, with only a ripple of applause. Varadkar accepted as much when reflecting on the speech afterwards. “I appreciate that there will be differences of opinions in relation to Israel and Gaza,” he said. “There’s very strong historic support for Israel in the US, for lots of different reasons, but that’s not going to deflect me from saying what I feel needs to be said.” The motive behind that message, and the direction it is leading, is clear: at their meeting on Sunday the Taoiseach wants to impress on the US president Joe Biden the need for an immediate ceasefire to avert thousands of deaths. “I will ask America to get involved once again in the drive for peace. It happened before with President Carter. It happened before with President Clinton. I think, hopefully, President Biden can take the lead on this,” he said. Talking to the media the Taoiseach said he believed Biden is already moving in that direction. It is clear that the relationship between Biden and Israel’s prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has soured in recent months, and their increasingly divergent views on the conflict are known. As evidenced by recent polling, a growing percentage of Biden’s key support constituencies, including younger voters and minorities, have also pivoted away from unconditional support for Israel as the conflict has continued into its sixth month. The other overriding theme of the week was a positive one. It was marked by the joint appearance on stage at the Ireland Funds dinner of Michelle O’Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly. Both made warm speeches. The image of the two women together on stage, clearly comfortable to be working together, was received by the audience as a symbolically significant moment. It gave a clear and potent signal that the purgatorial abeyance of the Belfast Agreement was over and a devolved future was back on track.",0,1
2024/3/15,"Amnesty International stage protests at US embassy and Belfast consulate Third protest planned for St Patrick’s Day at the White House as  Varadkar hands Biden a bowl of shamrock  Amnesty International Ireland volunteers and supporters unfurled banners, and shamrocks at the US embassy in Ballsbridge on Friday as part of the organisation’s drive to use the St Patrick’s Day celebrations to remind US president Biden of international calls for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. A group of about 20 people and friends staged a colourful protest with yellow amnesty banners and green shamrocks held above their heads as an uilleann piper played. The Amnesty volunteers also handed in a letter addressed to US ambassador to Ireland Claire D Cronin, calling on her to ask Mr Biden to “listen to your Irish roots and demand a permanent Gaza ceasefire”. The protest is part of a three-part demonstration being held in Dublin, Belfast and Washington, designed to take advantage of the visit of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly, to Washington. In Belfast, a simultaneous protest was held at the US Consulate.  On Sunday, St Patrick’s Day, as Mr Varadkar presents the traditional bowl of shamrock to Mr Biden, Amnesty International USA is planning a solidarity vigil which will involve placing hundreds of images of shamrocks in front of the White House. “We ask President Biden to hear Irish people around the world pleading for an end to the atrocities. Since the horrific attacks of October 7th more than 30,000 Palestinian people have been killed, the majority of them women and children,” said Amnesty International Ireland’s executive director Stephen Bowen. “To allow this travesty to continue is unspeakable.” In a statement from Washington, Paul O’Brien, Amnesty International’s executive director in the USA, said: “President Biden proudly proclaims Irish ancestry. The Irish Government has steadfastly demanded an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. On St Patrick’s Day president Biden should join the Irish Government and Irish people in unequivocally calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.” Listen to our Inside Politics Podcast for the latest analysis and chat",0,1
2024/3/15,"Leo Varadkar must urge Biden to press Israel on ceasefire, Mary Robinson says Chair of Elders says Taoiseach must ‘deliver a political message in a very direct way’ while in the US Former president Mary Robinson has urged Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to use his meeting on Friday with US president Joe Biden to “deliver a political message in a very direct way” and influence Israel to implement a ceasefire and open up Gaza to allow aid to get in. She said the US government should also get Israel to accept a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict. Ms Robinson said Mr Biden “may just have to comply with American law”.  “There is American law that says arms should not be provided to a country that is blocking US aid. Israel is blocking US aid at the moment to Palestine,” Ms Robinson said. She stressed that the “government of prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu is on the wrong side of history completely, making the United States complicit in reducing the people to famine, making the world complicit”. In a very pointed message as chair of the Elders, a group of global leaders, Ms Robinson said “I want to deliver on behalf of the Elders a direct message to our Taoiseach Leo Varadkar”. Mr Varadkar should “not spend too much time on the dire humanitarian situation” because everyone knew what it was like. Speaking on RTÉ radio’s News at One, Ms Robinson said: “Leo Varadkar has access today to president [Joe] Biden and he will have access during the next few days and give the shamrock on Sunday. “He must use this completely politically at all levels, with the speaker of the House [of Representatives], with everyone to make it clear that Israel depends on the United States for military aid for money. “That’s what will change everything. We need a ceasefire and we need the opening up of Gaza with every avenue, mainly land avenues for aid to get in, because the situation is so bad. “And we need the political will, the way forward, which is the two-state solution and we need the Israeli government agreeing to that.” Mr Varadkar had to urge Mr Biden to stop the arms supply and “stop the money”. “I want the political message from the Taoiseach and from Irish representatives to be very clear,” Ms Robinson said, calling for an indefinite ceasefire and a move to the two-state solution. “This cannot happen I think under prime minister Netanyahu. He seems very opposed to the idea.” She believed that if Mr Biden took a “direct political step” that “they’re not going to provide any more military support, they’re not going to provide any more budgetary support at the moment for Israel until this government changes course or there’s a new government to change course, that will help concentrate on a ceasefire”. The Taoiseach is meeting Mr Biden in the Oval office for the traditional presentation of the bowl of shamrock and a private meeting with a number of items on the agenda including the war in Gaza, the Ukrainian war, Northern Ireland and the economy. “The United States can influence Israel by not continuing to provide arms. It has provided a lot of the arms, bombs and other arms that have been used on the Palestinian people and is continuing to do that. It is also providing money,” Ms Robinson said “Now is the time to call in a marker and say very directly to president Biden – he may not be hearing this enough from his own people because they’re worried about American politics – he has to say to him take the risk of the politics fallout of this election or else he will lose whatever credibility he has.”",0,1
2024/3/15,"Harris and Varadkar toast US-Irish ties with glass of fresh orange juice and a smile Taoiseach begins series of high-profile events in Washington with Kamala Harris breakfast Bacon crackling, easy listening on the radio and the easy of laughter of a casual breakfast; maybe the Friday morning meeting at US vice-president Kamala Harris’s residence evolved into that when the house was theirs again. But for the 10 minutes on Friday morning when Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the US vice-president stood in front of the lectern, the occasion served as an opportunity to confirm the solidarity of the bonds between the United States and Ireland, to chat a little about the unheralded element that comes with holding the second in command office and to raise a toast over a glass of orange juice. It was, in other words, a moment for camera flashes. “To update the words of one of your distinguished predecessors, the president of the United States has 330 million bosses,” Mr Varadkar told his host, who has endured heavy scrutiny over her term in office. “The vice-president has 330 million plus one. I think in some ways it is the hardest job and one that can have an extraordinary impact. I know a little as someone who went from Taoiseach to deputy before returning to the top job last year. And I’m not going to lie: I know which one I would prefer.” As scripted lines go, it was neatly delivered and raised a laugh among the guests in the room, with Ireland’s ambassador to the United States, Geraldine Byrne Nason, in attendance at the host’s table. Mr Varadkar went on to praise the vice-president for taking her recent remarks on the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. “And I believe, vice-president, that you showed great courage in recent weeks when you spoke out in favour of a ceasefire in Gaza. It can’t have been easy, but it was the right thing to do-and your words echoed all over the world. Like you we call for the unconditional and immediate release of all the hostages, the very significant increase in humanitarian aid, food, medicine and electricity and an end to the fighting by both sides.” It was another airing of the message that has become the central platform of the Taoiseach’s visit. Ms Harris was relaxed in welcoming back the Taoiseach, who was accompanied by his partner, Matthew Barrett. “I don’t think that we told you but Doug and I decided after our last visit that you would become our new couples friends,” she said before highlighting the historical depths of the relationship between the two countries. “And I am proud to continue this breakfast tradition here at the vice-president’s residence and to host you again. And this year we host one hundred years of diplomatic relations between the United States and Ireland. “And as we know the Irish people are part of the American history and American story from the very beginning -in 1776 three signatories of the declaration of Independence were Irish born. “Then in the 19th century, Frederick Douglas found refuge in Ireland when we fled slavery. Historians among us will know that when he went to Ireland, it was the first time that he fully felt like a man because of the kinship and the dignity that he received in Ireland. “And America has of course served as a place of hope for thousands of us and their descendants, including those who have held the highest offices in our land and at the moment that is of course our president, Joe Biden. The practice of the morning breakfast at the Naval Observatory, which was established as the vice presidential residence in 1976, was initiated by Mr Biden during his term as vice-president and has since become another branch of the folksy protocol which has made the annual St Patrick’s jamboree such a high profile exercise in diplomacy. Ms Harris said the Taoiseach has been “courageous” in the fight for women’s reproductive freedom. “You have made it clear that you intend that Ireland will play a positive role on the world stage given the challenges we all face. “Under your leadership Ireland has hosted one of the highest per capita populations of Ukrainian refugees, a testament to the generosity and kindness of the Irish people. I commend you for hosting in your own home a refugee who left days after the invasion began. “Ireland has been a leader in providing food water and medicine to the people of Gaza and when it comes to human rights Ireland made history in 2015 when it became the first country in the world to legalise same sex marriage on referendum. “On a personal note you have been an extraordinary model role to people around the world as one of the only LGBT leaders in history,” she said. “And you spoke movingly last year here about the work, to see you and Mr Barrett on the world stage is important for so many reasons as our long march for progress continues.” Ms Harris invited her guests to raise a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice to host another century of successful relations and then the front doors were smartly closed so her guests could enjoy their breakfast.",0,1
2024/3/15,"How do we Irish get away with the annual jamboree in Washington?   It seemed like Varadkar was in the room at  the moment when White House patience with Israel reached its limit Up on the Capitol it is that giddy time of year when the sound of bagpipes travels through the marbled halls, when it is advisable for staff to raid the wardrobe for something – anything – green, when president Joe Biden is in a mood to quote an Irish poet and when the White House pulls out all the stops – the security, the best china – for the Irish. As it unfolds the unavoidable observation is, annually, the most obvious. All of this is an audacious diplomatic coup. How do we get away with this? And having breakfasted with vice-president Kamala Harris, having then conveyed Ireland’s stance on Gaza to president Biden in the Oval Office, under the sharp, benign eye of Abe Lincoln’s portrait and all that ... history ... drifting through the circular room; having afterwards dashed across the city to the Capitol for lunch with the republican Speaker Mike Johnson and the Friends of Ireland Caucus, Leo Varadkar had to admit that there was maybe an element of getting away with it about all of this. “I believe that Ireland is perhaps the only country in the world that can get away with turning its national holiday into a week of international events,” he told the guests of Speaker Mike Johnson in the Rayburn room. The president was beaming. Minutes earlier the president had just asked Michelle O’Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly, the new faces of Northern Ireland, to stand up. “Who’d a thunk it?” he said. Beside Biden, Johnson smiled and nodded as Varadkar extended an official welcome to Ireland. Neither of the American politicians would have enjoyed chummy chats in the corridors of late. But here they were, Irish men all for an hour. Maybe if they could celebrate St Patrick’s here every week of the year the Republicans and Democrats would be passing bipartisan bills in jig-time. At the very least they’d know their poets. The potency of this annual showcase is that it is, in a sense, illusory. The speeches are often cloaked in fuzzy platitudes to hope and history – it was almost a miracle that the morning passed without reference to Seamus Heaney’s immortal line. Still, the Taoiseach had come to Washington this year with a clear and explicit message to deliver on Gaza. He delivered the night he arrived in Boston and repeated it at all locations on Friday. It helps to be a lucky general. What the Irish Government party could not have bargained on as they flew across the Atlantic was that even then Chuck Schumer, the House majority leader and the most senior Jewish politician on the Hill was penning a lengthy, deeply personal lecture on the Middle East delivered on Thursday. It was scathing in its criticism of the Israeli leadership and urgent in its call for a ceasefire and an end to the horrific death toll visited on Palestinians. It was, by some distance, the most explicit criticism of Israel by a senior Democratic figure. And in the Oval office, after the president and Taoiseach exchanged pleasantries, Biden described it as “a good speech”, saying that Schumer had “expressed a serious concern shared not only by him but by many Americans”. It put Varadkar in the room on what seemed like the moment that signalled the limitations of White House patience towards Israel. Soft diplomacy – set to a traditional Irish air. Biden did not stay for long in the Capitol but skipped down the steps of the Capitol with Johnson and Varadkar. These Irish days seem to give him the elixir of youth. He smiled from “The Beast” as the vast cavalcade moved off. The day had been such a roaring success that the Taoiseach might have chanced the oldest Irish farewell by rapping his knuckles off the bonnet of “The Beast” as it pulled away. But you can only get away with so much.",0,1

During his address to the annual Speaker’s Lunch at the US Capitol to mark St Patrick’s Day, Mr Biden asked both leaders to stand and for the room to acknowledge their contributions. “Thank you for reminding us what the possibilities are for working across the aisle and rising above long standing disagreements,” Mr Biden said.

The demonstration saw activists line both banks of the River Liffey at the landmark Ha’penny Bridge on Saturday afternoon. The protest was staged ahead of the St Patrick’s event in Washington DC on Sunday, when Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will present US president Joe Biden with a bowl of shamrock to celebrate the Irish patron saint. Senior politicians from both sides of the  Border will be at the annual event in the White House. Activists denounced their planned attendance at the White House during the vocal and colourful Dublin protest. They insisted the politicians should be boycotting the ceremony due to the US’s continued support of Israel amid its ongoing bombardment of Gaza. As well as displaying black shamrocks, campaigners waved Irish and Palestinian flags and chanted slogans supportive of Palestine and critical of the US administration. Other demonstrators boarded boats that moved up and down the Liffey during the protest,  organised by the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC). IPSC chairwoman Zoe Lawlor said: “The black shamrock is our symbol of resistance and declaration that Ireland stands with Palestine – that we support the Palestinian struggle for freedom, justice and equality. “We have been consistently demanding that no Irish politician should be meeting or sharing shamrocks with the Biden administration while the Palestinians in Gaza are being slaughtered with US weapons and funding.” Aine Hayden from the IPSC handed leaflets to passing members of the public during the visual demonstration. “I’m here because my heart is completely shattered and broken looking at this genocide that’s been taking place for nearly six months now,” she said. “For the 13,000 children who’ve been blown to pieces and the many more thousands that are still under the rubble yet to be found; for the two children every day who lose a limb; every day two children lose one or both legs... for the 25,000 orphans  who are left with no family and the fact that they’re [the Israeli military are] targeting ambulances, hospitals, they’re targeting the Unrwa (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) food aid centres. They took out the last one the other day. “They’re targeting starving people who are queuing, waiting for a bag of flour, and they’re shooting and bombing them. “We’ve never seen the like of this outrage, this is barbarity, and it needs to stop. We need a permanent ceasefire now.” – PA",0,1
2024/3/16,"EU ‘100% correct’ to seek better environmental protections in Mercosur trade deal, says Ryan in Brazil France and Ireland are among member states opposed to agreement in its current form Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has defended calls from several European Union member states to renegotiate a trade deal with the Mercosur trade bloc of South American nations in order to strengthen environmental protections. The Green Party leader, speaking in Brazil during a visit that is part of the Government’s annual international programme to promote Ireland during the week of St Patrick’s Day, said the EU was “100 per cent justified and correct” in looking to set high environmental standards for international trade and it was important the union did not cause deforestation outside of the bloc as a result of its own trade policies. The EU and the Mercosur countries of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay agreed an ambitious trade agreement in 2019 after 20 years of negotiations, but the deal remains unratified in the face of fierce opposition from European farmers and deep concerns from environmental organisations about the role played by Brazil’s beef sector in deforestation in the Amazon jungle. France and Ireland are among the member states that have said they will not approve the agreement in its current form. Brazil, Mercosur’s dominant member, has dismissed calls to retool the deal as a late bid to shield European beef farmers from competing more directly with their more efficient South American peers. Mr Ryan said it was “not impossible” to bridge the gap between the two sides, with talks currently stalled ahead of elections for a new European Parliament, which along with member states must  ratify the agreement. “What we don’t want is to go into a protectionist world where Europe, America, China, Latin America and the rest of Asia end up in a trade war which won’t allow us to make the leap we need to make to what is a new economic system,” he said, referring to the global effort to transition away fossil fuels. Mr Ryan, who met with several environmental and indigenous groups during his week-long trip, said any diminution of environmental standards “is not in Brazil’s interest and it is not in Ireland’s and Europe’s interest”. Mr Ryan also met Brazil’s environment minister Marina Silva after a visit to the Amazonian city of Belém,  which next year will host the COP30 summit. He praised Brazilian leadership in setting up a task force on financing the global transition to renewable energy within the G20 group of major economies, whose heads of state meet in Rio de Janeiro in November. “What we saw in recent years is that if you can stitch things into G20 declarations, then it is much easier to get agreement at COP,” he said. As well as climate, Mr Ryan discussed the crisis in Gaza in a meeting with Brazilian foreign minister Mauro Vieira. Ireland and Brazil have been among the strongest critics within their respective regions of Israel’s military response to the October 7th Hamas attack. The two men also discussed the war between Russia and Ukraine. While Brazil condemned Russia’s invasion, it has refused to impose sanctions on Moscow, which is Brazil’s biggest supplier of diesel and largest source of fertilisers for its booming agricultural sector. While criticising the invasion, Brazil’s President Lula has said his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy is “as responsible” as Vladimir Putin for the conflict and has called for the US to stop funding Kyiv in order to force it to the negotiating table. Mr Lula also recently confirmed  he will attend a summit of the Bric nations being hosted by Mr Putin in Kazan in October. Mr Ryan said he told his Brazilian counterpart, “Don’t underestimate European solidarity when it comes to supporting Ukraine. That would be a mistake.”",0,1
2024/3/17,"Taoiseach raises need for bombs to stop in Gaza, as central part of shamrock ceremony speech with US president  Leo Varadkar moves Joe Biden to tears when he quotes the president’s late son, Beau Biden The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar made a plea for the immediate need for bombs to stop in Gaza the central part of his speech at the annual shamrock ceremony reception in the White House with president Joe Biden. Mr Varadkar also strongly identified with the Palestinian people in some of the strongest comments he has made during his week-long visit to the US. During the course of his remarks he also moved Mr Biden to tears when he quoted the president’s late son, Beau Biden, who died of cancer in 2015. Mr Biden wiped away tears as Mr Varadkar recalled what Beau Biden had said about “the promises we make to our children, who deserve a chance to succeed”. The Taoiseach told a large audience in the East Room of the White House that the Irish people identified with Palestinians and were deeply troubled by the catastrophe unfolding there. “We see our history in their eyes. A story of displacement, of dispossession, of national identity questioned and denied. Forced emigration. Discrimination. And now hunger.” He said he supported Mr Biden’s work to secure a ceasefire and said the most immediate need was for bombs to stop. Mr Varadkar also said Israel’s history was reflected in the eyes of Irish people. “A diaspora whose heart never left home no matter how many generations passed. A nation state that was reborn and a language revived.” He said it was possible for Ireland to be supportive of both Israel and Palestine. He said the experience of the Northern peace process – particularly the concepts of parity of esteem and a totality of relationships – would be useful for any future negotiations. Earlier, Mr Varadkar said that people who have criticised the shamrock bowl ceremony in the White House misunderstand its significance and its context. Speaking outside the White House in Washington DC before the St Patrick’s Day ceremony with US president Joe Biden on Sunday, Mr Varadkar defended the custom saying it forms part of a weeklong programme that involves comprehensive engagement with the US administration on high level policy. He said it would not be “wise” for him as Taoiseach to hold a meeting with the president on Friday in the Oval Office and then snub the shamrock ceremony on Sunday. He met Mr Biden for 30 minutes on Friday and said afterwards the US president told him the White House was pressing hard with countries in the Middle East, as well as using its influence with Israel, to put in place a ceasefire within a number of weeks. Specifically asked about an opinion piece in The Irish Times at the weekend by novelist Sally Rooney – where she claimed the picture of the Taoiseach alongside a president who supported Israel would “haunt us forever” – the Taoiseach said that view did not reflect the depth of engagement. “I think what happens here [in Washington] is a lot more than the shamrock ceremony. I think that is to misunderstand what I as Taoiseach and previous taoisigh have done here. “That particular ceremony is an important one. It has gone back 40 years. What’s of enormous value here is the ability to have those meetings with the president, with the vice-president, with governors, with senators, with members of the cabinet. It allows us to put across our perspective and analysis and also to hear from them as well. It’s interesting to hear other people’s perspectives and understand what they’re doing,” he said. Mr Varadkar argued that Ireland was a small country but could use its voice. “We can call for an immediate ceasefire [in Gaza] as we have for quite some time to a country that’s big, powerful, influential like America. They’re the ones that can make it happen, but they don’t just make it happen by calling for it. They have to try to negotiate it. And that is what they’re doing”. Mr Varadkar said the war in Gaza was one of the issues he wanted to discuss while on the weeklong visit to the US and he had raised it at every opportunity. He disclosed he had met the director of the CIA, William J Burns, this weekend and had learned about the work the US was doing to try to secure a ceasefire. “I have no doubt that the US administration is working hard to put a stop to the violence in Gaza, to have a ceasefire that’s abided by both sides ...  with a view to moving towards a permanent peace. “Over the past few months ... I’ve seen the European position move and the US position move as well. It’s much closer to our position than it was in October or November. “It’s very clear to me that this administration is working very hard to secure a ceasefire to try to develop that into a permanent peace. And I think you’ve seen a change of tone here, in Washington, from Senator [Chuck] Schumer and others who have been far more overtly critical of the Israeli government,” he said. Senator Schumer harshly criticised the militant approach of Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu in a Senate speech last week that also criticised the huge civilian toll in Gaza. The Taoiseach said efforts by Israel to find a military solution to eliminate Hamas would not succeed. He also said he believed what Israel was doing would drive the extreme ideology and could end up radicalising more people. “It’s a big mistake. I don’t think it’s in the interests of Israel’s long-term security to believe that there is a military solution that gives them security. “We have had 100 years of violence now in that region. And it’s very clear to me that the solution isn’t going to be eliminating a terrorist organisation like Hamas, and it is a terrorist organisation, because the ideology behind it just becomes stronger until there’s just and lasting peace.” Mr Varadkar also said the changed dispensation in the North had not changed his mind that Sinn Féin would be an unsuitable partner for Fine Gael in Government. “We believe their economic policies would send Ireland backwards and would make Ireland broke again. We believe that their foreign policy would take us away from being at the heart of Europe ... and would risk making enemies of our friends,” he said.",0,1
2024/3/17,"Government under too much pressure to provide migrants with accommodation of choice - Minister Roderic O’Gorman, in Tokyo, says asylum seekers moved from Mount Street in Dublin to Crooksling now have  showers, toilet facilities and security The Government was under too much pressure to provide migrants with accommodation in their “location of choice”, the Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman has said. His comments came following the clearance of a makeshift campsite on Mount Street in Dublin city centre  sheltering as many as 200 asylum seekers on Saturday morning. The asylum seekers were brought to the grounds of a former nursing home in Crooksling off the N81 in southwest Dublin. Portions of that building were damaged in an arson attack last month, following rumours the facility might be used as an accommodation centre for migrants. Some of the asylum seekers have since returned to Mount Street. Mr O’Gorman defended their weekend relocation. The Minister, who is on a six-day visit to Japan, said he acknowledged that “a small number” have indicated they are not happy with the new location but insisted it is an improvement. “They have access to showers, toilet facilities…meals and they have security as well. And they didn’t have access to any of this at the site in Mount Street,” he told The Irish Times in Tokyo. “I think it’s significantly better than the place they were in.” “Unfortunately, with the amount of pressure on accommodation right now the government isn’t in a position to provide people with accommodation in a location of choice,” he continued. “We’re under real pressure. But again, this site has security, it has access to sanitation, toilets, showers and meals for the international protection applicants.” The relocation has been condemned by, among others, Dublin Communities Against Racism, which said it was done “to present a nice picture of the city for tourists and foreign media during Saint Patrick Day celebrations.” “No matter what pretty picture is presented for St Patrick’s Day, our international reputation is in tatters,” said the pressure group. The Department of Integration was under political pressure to clear the Mount Street tents ahead of the holiday. Last week, Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan wrote to Mr O’Gorman, calling the camp a “permanent blight” on Dublin and said there was a “significant risk that there will be an outbreak of disease in the area.” Mr O’Gorman also again rejected opposition calls for his resignation, following the failure of the Family and Care referendums. “I’ve expressed deep disappointment at the result of the referendum. That’s the will of the people and I accept it and we move on. I’ll keep working in terms of delivering on accommodation for refugees.” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the asylum seekers were moved on the grounds that there were no sanitary facilities available at Mount Street. “There were no showers, no toilets on Mount Street,” the Taoiseach said. “The alternative solution was to move them for health and safety reasons from a place where there were no facilities to a place where there was,” he said. Mr Varadkar was speaking in Washington DC on the second last day of a week-long visit to the US. He disagreed with the suggestion that the site was too isolated. “Being provided with accommodation where there is running water, where there are showers, where there are toilets is better than living on the streets,” he said. Asked whether he had concerns over security on the site given the arson attack last month, as well as protests on the issue, he said: “The reason why it was chosen [to accommodate migrants] is because it is State-owned, and it was available, and there was running water, showers, and toilets. “It has much better conditions than people would have experienced on Mount Street. “Unfortunately, there are protests. There are risks everywhere. You’ll recall what happened on Sandwith Street,” he said, referring to  protests and disturbances  on Sandwith Street,  located close to the International Protection office in Mount Street. “Unfortunately, no matter where people are, there are going be certain risks. Obviously, security measures are put in place as well.”",0,1
2024/3/17,"Hamas and Israel should have no part in governing Gaza after conflict, Varadkar says Taoiseach says proposals put forward by Israel for the ‘day after’ the conflict are unacceptable Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said Hamas should not form any part of the entity that governs Gaza after the conflict comes to an end but believes the territory should be handed back over to Palestinian civilian control. During his visit to the US this week, Mr Varadkar said that the proposals put forward by Israel for the “day after” the conflict were unacceptable. Asked this weekend what his own solution would be, the Taoiseach said the most urgent thing was the need for a ceasefire to allow food, medicine and humanitarian assistance into Gaza. “Once that happens, we would hope it becomes possible to build a more permanent ceasefire,” Mr Varadkar said. “I think everyone agrees that Hamas can’t be part of the governing of any Palestinian territory given what’s happened on October 7th.” He also said that Israel should have no part or control of the territory. “We don’t believe that it should be reoccupied by Israel,” Mr Varadkar said. “We certainly don’t believe it should be resettled by Israel. “We believe it should be handed back over to Palestinian civilian control. Unlike was the case in 2005, it shouldn’t be blockaded by Israel. “Even though Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2007, they retained effective control of the airspace, of the sea around Gaza. That shouldn’t be the case afterwards.” Mr Varadkar said Ireland was one of a group of countries that would be keen, once Palestinian control of Gaza is re-established, to work towards recognition of a Palestinian State. The Taoiseach was speaking in Washington DC on the eve of the shamrock ceremony in the White House on Sunday. Mr Varadkar will have brunch in the White House with US president Joe Biden and will later in the afternoon lead a groups of Irish dignitaries who will be present in the East Wing of the White House for the annual shamrock ceremony.",0,1
2024/3/18,"Rose Dugdale, English heiress who joined Provisional IRA, dies aged 83 Sinn Féin politicians pay tribute to ‘true revolutionary’ who was involved in Russborough House art heist Rose Dugdale, an English heiress who joined the Provisional IRA and was involved in the 1974 Russborough House art raid, has died. She was 83. Sinn Féin politicians have paid tribute to Ms Dugdale, describing her as “a true revolutionary” and a “comrade and friend”. Her life was the subject of an RTÉ documentary last year, The Heiress and the Heist, as well as a recent biography by Seán O’Driscoll entitled Heiress, Rebel, Vigilante, Bomber: The Extraordinary Life of Rose Dugdale. Born to a wealthy family, Ms Dugdale later went on to study economics at Oxford. She became involved in IRA activities during the Troubles. In 1973, Eddie Gallagher – who she later married – recruited her to assist him in seizing a helicopter, from which he attempted to bomb a barracks in Strabane. The following year she was a member of the gang that stole 19 paintings – then valued at IR£8 million – from Russborough, then the home of former Conservative MP Sir Alfred Beit and his wife. The couple were bound and gagged during the raid and the paintings were later found in Co Cork. Ms Dugdale and others involved in the raid were afterwards jailed for the robbery. She gave birth to a son during her sentence. Gallagher, the boy’s father, remained at large and subsequently kidnapped Dutch businessman Tiede Herrema, demanding in vain Ms Dugdale’s release in exchange for Herrema’s. Ms Dugdale became an active member of Sinn Féin and lived in Dublin. Daithí Doolan, Sinn Féin councillor on Dublin City Council and candidate for the European elections, described her in a post on X (formerly Twitter) as “a true revolutionary who inspired others”, adding she had “dedicated her life to Irish freedom”. He described her as an “amazing woman” and offered his deepest sympathies to Ms Dugdale’s family. Asked about her IRA membership, Mr Doolan said she was a “freedom fighter” but also said she “was an avid supporter of the peace process”. Dublin South Central Sinn Féin TD Aengus Ó Snodaigh said he was “deeply saddened” to learn of Ms Dugdale’s death. He said: “Rose was a committed republican and was unflinching in her beliefs, and Ireland has today lost a committed republican and activist, and Sinn Féin a valued comrade.” He added: “Rose for many decades lived in Dublin, in the south inner-city, Drimnagh and in recent years in a nursing home in Chapelizod, and was an active member of Sinn Féin. “She was extremely committed to her community”. Dublin Mid-West TD Mark Ward posted on X that he was “very sad” to hear of Ms Dugdale’s death. He said he still had a postcard she sent him after he was first elected that encouraged him to “reach my full potential”. Former MEP Martina Anderson posted: “RIP Rose Dugdale. Rose taught me a lot and I will never forget her. Proud to call Rose a comrade and friend.” A new film called Baltimore, which stars Imogen Poots as Ms Dugdale and portrays the 1974 raid on Russborough House, is released in cinemas this Friday.",0,1
2024/3/19,"Fine Gael TD Ciarán Cannon to quit: ‘There’s a toxicity in politics that was barely palpable 20 years ago’ Galway East representative is the 10th Fine Gael TD to announce intention to quit politics at the next election Fine Gael TD Ciarán Cannon has announced he will retire from politics at the next general election and cited “a toxicity in politics” as a factor in his decision. Mr Cannon becomes the 10th Fine Gael TD to announce he will quit politics at the next election, leaving party managers with a headache as they seek replacements for established vote-getters in several constituencies, with a general election in less than a year’s time. Mr Cannon, who has served as a junior minister in two departments in a Dáil career that began in 2011, was previously a senator and the last leader of the Progressive Democrats after that party suffered a mauling at the 2007 general election. He joined Fine Gael and was elected to the Dáil for the Galway East constituency in 2011, retaining the seat in the two general elections since. He was a Minister of State in the Department of Education and later at the Department of Foreign Affairs. Announcing his decision this morning, Mr Cannon said: “After 20 years in any role, I think you begin to reach a point where you’ve given all you can give. I have a deep respect for the people who elected me again and again, and I’m either all in on their behalf, or I’m not.” Mr Cannon also used his resignation statement to point to the increasingly hostile public attitude to politicians and said this was a factor in his decision to leave. “It would be remiss of me not to comment on the difference between being a politician now and 20 years ago,” he said. “That’s also been a factor in my decision to leave. There’s a coarseness, a toxicity in politics now that was barely palpable 20 years ago. “None of us asks to be put on a pedestal, or to be treated any differently. We just ask to be treated with the same civility and respect as anyone else doing their job,” he said. “Yes, politicians are subject to public scrutiny, and rightly so, but what we are experiencing right now goes far beyond that and can be deeply damaging to our wellbeing. At times it feels like it’s open season on you and your family. That’s not acceptable, nor indeed sustainable, if we want to have good people choosing politics as a career.” Paying tribute, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that Mr Cannon “is a gentleman who will be missed by all who know him or who work with him in the Dáil. I wish him the very best in his life after politics”. “I particularly want to thank Ciarán for the role he played in helping Ireland to secure election to the UN Security Council. I have always admired the way, as a TD in a rural constituency, that he promoted climate action, environmental protection and biodiversity even when not always popular,” Mr Varadkar said. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said there was a “dark undertone” in parts of public life and that he had himself experienced some of the “toxicity” referred to by Mr Cannon in his decision to leave politics. Speaking on Tuesday he said that politics could also be very rewarding and he encouraged anyone interested in seeking to enter public life to do so. Mr Donohoe also said he “absolutely intended” to run in the next general election. Asked about the ten Fine Gael politicians who had announced that they were not seeking re-election, Mr Donohoe pointed to former jockey Nina Carberry who is hoping to be a candidate for the party in the upcoming European elections. “The fact that Nina Carberry has expressed interest in being a candidate in the European Parliament elections continues to show that both Fine Gael and Irish politics is capable of attracting new candidates and really experienced people who want to attempt to enter public life,” he said. He said he had spoken to Mr Cannon on Tuesday and said he very much regretted that “a superb TD and Minister” was leaving public life. He described Mr Cannon as a “great colleague and a friend”. “The broader issue we have to consider is the changed discourse around politics and the changed tone and atmosphere around it and what that means for politicians for all parties for attracting those people into politics and keeping them in politics.” Mr Cannon becomes the 10th Fine Gael TD to announce he will not be standing for re-election. TDs John Paul Phelan, Michael Creed, Charlie Flanagan, Brendan Griffin, Joe McHugh, Fergus O’Dowd, David Stanton, Richard Bruton and Paul Kehoe have all made similar announcements. MEPs Frances Fitzgerald and Deirdre Clune have also said they will not seek re-election.",0,1
2024/3/19,"Exodus of incumbents damages Fine Gael morale Cannon joins list of almost a third of 35 TDs who won seats for Fine Gael in the 2020 election that are unlikely to seek re-election The announcement by Ciaran Cannon that he will not contest the next general election brings to 11 the number of Fine Gael TDs who won seats in 2020 and will not seek to hold them at the next election. Cannon is the 10th to announce his departure in the past year or so, with the former Dublin Bay South TD and minister for housing Eoghan Murphy resigning his seat in 2021. Fine Gael sources speculate there are more to come, with questions typically directed at older TDs Bernard Durkan and Michael Ring, as well as wilder rumours about some of the more prominent frontbenchers. All currently maintain they will stand again. But as one senior party figure puts it, “you’re running in the next election until you’re not”. Two sitting MEPs, Frances Fitzgerald – rumoured to have designs on a presidential bid – and Deirdre Clune are also stepping down. So of the 35 TDs who won seats for Fine Gael at the 2020 general election it is heading towards a third of them who won’t seek re-election. In an electoral system where incumbency is a proven advantage that is a significant blow to the party. The latest departure adds to a growing unease in Fine Gael as the party prepares its bid to be returned to power for an unprecedented fourth time in a row. While Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has sought to explain the departures as the natural churn in a party that saw a large number of first-time TDs elected in 2011, and although each retirement is explicable by its own individual circumstances, there is no doubt that the exodus of incumbents has two effects – it weakens the party by depriving it of proven vote-getters, and damages morale in an organisation already jumpy about its prospects. True, Cannon’s departure is unlikely to cost the party a seat; Galway East gains an extra seat to become a four-seater under the boundary revisions announced last summer, and two seats out of four would always have been a stretch. Like many other constituencies a Sinn Féin candidate who narrowly missed out last time is considered a dead cert next time out. And the extra seat means that the Sinn Féin gain need not be at anyone’s expense. Local Fine Gaelers will be glad of that. The official line from Fine Gael is to talk of generational change, and to pepper their responses with the names of new candidates who are gunning to replace the old guard. And it is true that the party has a crop of promising replacements waiting for their chances. But there is no escaping the unease now current in the party about its future, its prospects and – sometimes – its leader. Simmering not far below the surface, that unease has just been ratcheted up another notch or two.",0,1
2024/3/2,"UK government should ‘step up’ and reform Stormont, Naomi Long tells Alliance Party conference Alliance Party leader says Northern Secretary would be largely to blame if Assembly were to collapse again    The UK government must “step up and do some seriously heavy lifting” to reform the Northern institutions, the Alliance Party leader Naomi Long has said. Speaking at her party conference in Belfast on Saturday, Ms Long warned that this must happen “sooner rather than later” or the Northern Secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, would be “permanently burdened with a large share of the blame” for any future collapse of the Assembly. Calling for “action to implement real and tangible progress towards actual reform”, Ms Long contrasted London’s approach with that of Dublin, and said she was “encouraged by the thoughtful and considered manner” in which the Tánaiste, Micheál Martin, addressed the issue in a speech to the conference on Friday night. Mr Martin said it was now time to “begin a meaningful conversation about reform” and “look now at what we can do to make the institutions more stable and effective while, of course, retaining the [Belfast] Agreement’s foundational commitment to meaningful powersharing and inclusiveness.” He said there were “serious questions” to be answered over the power of a single party to block the functioning of the Assembly and Executive and, he added, discussions on reform must involve “all the parties, civic voices and both governments ... we cannot have any more one-sided negotiations only involving one party or one perspective”. Alliance is the first of the main Northern parties to gather for its annual conference since the restoration of the powersharing institutions following a two-year suspension due to the DUP’s boycott. The party has long called for the reform of the Northern institutions to make them more sustainable and prevent future collapse. However, last month the UK government ruled this out, saying in response to a Westminster report recommending an overhaul of the rules governing powersharing, that reform of the Agreement was not being considered “at this time” and “voices from the UK or Irish governments should not be at the forefront of any calls for reform”. Criticising this stance, Ms Long said that despite the “open door” on this issue offered by Alliance, the Northern Secretary had not only declined to take it, “but seemed keen to lock it up again and throw away the key”. She said she wanted to “approach this new mandate with optimism, to have confidence that the last collapse was the last collapse” but it was a “warning against complacency” that neither the First Minister or Deputy First Minister would give a firm commitment, when called up on to do so by the SDLP, that they would not use their power to collapse the Executive again. “The only possible reason for those parties to argue that they should retain the power to collapse the institutions is if they intend to either use that power or use the threat of using it to control the Executive,” she said. In her speech Ms Long also called for a UK general election “the sooner the better” as “the only thing this morally bankrupt [UK] government can do protect democracy” and spoke of the party’s ambitions to add to its tally of a single Westminster seat, currently held by the party’s deputy leader, the North Down MP Stephen Farry. In East Belfast, Lagan Valley and the new constituency of South Belfast and mid-Down, Ms Long said there were “significant opportunities for us not only to maintain Alliance representation at Westminster but to grow it further still”. There was also vocal support in a number of conference speeches for the newly-appointed Minister for Agriculture and the Environment, Andrew Muir. Ms Long said she was “proud” he was “the first openly gay minister in the Northern Ireland Executive” and said “some of the criticism has been rather churlish and some of it bordering on homophobic. “I hope that for the many young LGBTQ+ people living in rural communities, you will serve as a very visible and positive reminder that they are not alone, that they can make a difference and that they are valued,” she said.",0,1
2024/3/2,"Ryan and Coveney in heated row over data centres Simon Coveney forcefully argued that Minister for the Environment’s proposal was not agreed Government policy Disagreements in the Government over the future construction of data centres came to a head during an angry row between Green Party leader and Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan and Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney at a Cabinet committee meeting. Mr Ryan is seeking a change in Government policy that would block any future data centres that did not have their own carbon-neutral sources of energy. This was strongly opposed by Mr Coveney, who pointed out forcefully that had not been agreed Government policy at a Cabinet economic committee meeting two weeks ago. The two men engaged in what some people present, and others who were briefed afterwards, described as a heated argument on the subject, though sources close to both men were keen to confirm that there had been no lasting personal fallout. But they did acknowledge the encounter, and the continuing dispute over policy. Ireland has more than 80 data centres, where technology companies house the IT infrastructure that runs their websites, apps and online services and stores vast quantities of digital information. Their number has grown rapidly in recent years. Last year, an industry survey reported that in addition to the existing 82 centres, a further 14 were under construction, while planning has been approved for 40 more. Data centres use vast quantities of electricity, and now account for as much electricity usage as all urban households in the State, almost a fifth of the total. There have been calls for a moratorium on new data centres, as concerns over the impact on the grid – and the effect on Ireland’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions – grow. It is understood that Mr Ryan conceded there was no question of blocking data centres that already had consent. However, he argued that any future data centres must be zero carbon before they could be approved. A source familiar with the issue said this would mean they would be powered by renewables and have backup power sources such as batteries and zero-carbon fuels such as biomethane, hydrogenated vegetable oils or hydrogen. Mr Ryan also wants to ensure that future data centres don’t put pressure on the electricity grid or affect Ireland’s energy security. It is understood Mr Coveney said he understood the environmental issues and the threat to the grid, but pointed out that any change in policy would have to be agreed by the entire Government and not unilaterally implemented by Mr Ryan. There was also nervousness about the message to the hugely important tech sector, which has been one of the main drivers of bumper corporation tax returns in the past decade, if the Government were to announce a blanket ban. A spokesman for the Government said: “The Government’s agreed policy acknowledges the challenges around energy supply and climate but does not envisage a blanket ban on new data centres, especially where they are linked to major employment in the country.” A policy statement from 2022 declares a “preference” for data centres “that can demonstrate a clear pathway to decarbonise and ultimately provide net-zero data services.” Mr Ryan’s proposal, however, goes significantly beyond this preference to ban completely data centres that are not zero carbon.

In next Friday’s referendums, the Government proposes – in two votes – expanding the definition of family in the Constitution to recognise “durable relationships”, such as cohabiting couples and their children, and replacing the language around women’s “duties in the home” with language recognising care within families. The spending of taxpayer funding to parties on referendum campaigns is prohibited, but they can use revenues accumulated through their own fundraising. A Fine Gael statement said it has allocated €55,000 to this campaign, to be spent on a mix of posters, literature and advertising. Fianna Fáil did not offer an estimate for its spending, saying: “We will report on our allocated campaign budget in due course in accordance with the relevant guidelines.” The Green Party has earmarked €12,000 for the campaign, including the cost of 800 posters. Sinn Féin, also supporting Yes votes, expects to spend €10,000 mostly for leaflets and posters. The Labour Party is set to spend €2,000. People Before Profit will spend about €400 between the costs of holding an event setting out its reluctant support for Yes votes and the cost of producing a video on the party’s stance. The Social Democrats said the figure for its spending was not yet available. Combined spending by political parties will not be anywhere near more than €323,000 parties spent promoting the Yes side in the 2015 same-sex marriage referendum. The National Women’s Council (NWC) said it has some €53,488 including funds from “unrestricted reserves” for the Yes-Yes campaign. NWC said it would spend “no more than what we raise”. Expenditure includes the campaign launch and co-ordination, high-vis jackets, leaflets, local advertisements, badges, the yesyes.ie website and staff costs. Some of the NWC’s general funding comes from the State. Asked what measures it is taking to ensure State funds are not used for the referendums, the council said: “NWC is fully compliant with the legislation and guidelines governing expenditure in referendums and has a proven track record from previous referendum campaigns.” It continued: “We have stringent financial controls in place, which we adhere to for all transactions regarding expenditure in this referendum.” Another non-governmental organisation on the Yes side, One Family, said it expects to spend up to approximately €12,000 on flyers, advertising and events. Both NWC and One Family are registered as so-called third parties with the electoral watchdog, the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo), as are the Iona Institute and the Christian Solidarity Party, two organisations that are supportive of No votes. Individuals or groups that are not a political party and receive a donation for “political purposes” exceeding the value of €100 must register as a “third party”. The definition of “political purposes” in Sipo guidelines includes seeking to “influence the outcome of the election or a referendum or a campaign”. Independent Senator Sharon Keogan, who has been advocating No votes, set up a GoFundMe account on Wednesday aiming to raise €40,000 to pay for 5,000 posters and a full-page advert in a Sunday newspaper. As of Friday morning donations stood at more than €14,100. Ms Keogan said her initiative was “ambitious” in the short time frame but she is “determined to make a difference in this campaign”. She said she has sent her paperwork to Sipo to register as a third party and she will “comply with all regulations”. The Iona Institute previously spent large sums on the No side of the referendums on same-sex marriage (€194,530) and the repeal of the Eighth Amendment on abortion (€211,000). Responding to questions, Iona’s chief executive, David Quinn, indicated that the institute was not planning any spending on the No campaign. The institute commissioned a poll by Amárach that covered a topic relevant to the referendum on care, the results of which appeared in the media. Asked if poll could amount to campaign spending, Mr Quinn said: “The poll was inexpensive because it was attached to an omnibus poll and the sample was quite small. I don’t know if it counts as campaign expenditure as such. We often commission polls along similar lines to track public opinion on such issues. We will need to contact Sipo about it to be sure.” Aontú, which is campaigning for No votes in both referendums, plans to spend “less than €2,000″, according to party leader Peadar Tóibín, on posters and leaflets. Cathal Ashbourne Loftus, secretary of the Christian Solidarity Party, said it would spend less than €1,000. The Irish Women’s Lobby (IWL), another organisation on the No side, said it was “run on a voluntary basis and all expenses come from the pockets of our volunteers. For this reason we have spent a minimal amount.”",0,1
2024/3/20,"Leo Varadkar in power: Five highs and five lows through Covid, a housing crisis and Brexit Outgoing Taoiseach was not immune to gaffes or becoming the centre of the ‘Leo the Leak’ GP contract controversy Leo Varadkar is leaving the stage, resigning as Fine Gael leader and departing following his second stint as Taoiseach in the coming weeks. From his stunning victory in the Fine Gael leadership race in June 2017 and huge popularity in the early months of the pandemic in 2020 to the perma-crises of housing, health and immigration – along with the gaffes – here are five highs and five lows of his time in power. Varadkar’s 2017 leadership bid was devastatingly effective. Several ministers and prominent TDs backed him from the very beginning of the race. The campaign run by his rival Simon Coveney never recovered from this string of endorsements for Varadkar. He won the leadership in June after a campaign that showed Varadkar’s political skills at their sharpest. When Varadkar was elected Fine Gael leader, he said it demonstrated that “prejudice has no hold in this Republic”. The son of an Indian immigrant came out as a gay man during the same-sex marriage referendum just two years previously. Recent worrying anti-immigrant protests notwithstanding, Varadkar’s ascent to Taoiseach showed how Ireland became a more modern and progressive society. Fears of a no-deal Brexit reached their peak after Boris Johnson became UK prime minister in 2019. He had promised to scrap the “backstop” aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland. Amid the deadlock, a meeting was arranged between Varadkar and Johnson at the Wirral in England that October. A deal was struck replacing the backstop with the Northern Ireland protocol with many viewing Varadkar’s intervention as crucial. As Covid-19 spread, Varadkar was in the US on St Patrick’s Day duties when he announced Ireland would be entering its first lockdown. He asked people to “make enormous sacrifices”, saying many lives could be saved. He said that while the economy would suffer, it would bounce back, people’s lives would return to normal and “we will prevail”. Varadkar, leader of what was then a caretaker government, make similar speeches to a frightened population during the pandemic. By June his satisfaction rating in the first Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI poll stood at an astonishing 75 per cent. It would not last; it fell to 40 per cent in February 2024, but the high level of public approval for how he steered the country through the early months of the pandemic showed his leadership skills. During Varadkar’s premiership, the State reach effective full employment and recorded exchequer surpluses as the country recovered strongly from the economic shock of the pandemic. From 2019 to 2023, spanning Varadkar’s terms as Taoiseach and stint as minister for enterprise, trade and employment, some 350,000 new jobs were created, bringing total employment to an all-time high of 2.6 million. There was only one Budget during Mr Varadkar’s second stint as Taoiseach but it was a giveaway with welfare increases, tax cuts and a range of cost-of-living measures. Despite more recent turbulence, the economy remains in good shape as Varadkar prepares to leave office. The controversy around Varadkar’s leaking of a draft GP contract rumbled on for almost two years as his second term as Taoiseach approached. Gardaí launched an investigation after it emerged Varadkar had, in 2019, leaked a copy of the contract agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation to his then friend, Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail, who was at the time president of the rival group, the now defunct National Association of General Practitioners. Details of the leak emerged in October 2020 but it would not be until July 2022 that Varadkar would learn he would not face criminal charges. During the “Leo the leak” controversy Varadkar consistently maintained that he committed no crime and said the allegations against him were “false” and were “politically motived”, though he did apologise for “errors of judgment”. In October 2020 Varadkar, then tánaiste to Fianna Fáil taoiseach Micheál Martin, heavily criticised the State’s then medical officer Dr Tony Holohan during an appearance on Claire Byrne’s RTÉ television programme. Varadkar hit out at how the Government had been told to shut down for a second time during the Covid-19 pandemic “without prior consultation”. He went further, criticising members of the National Public Health Emergency Team, the team that advised Government on public health guidelines during the pandemic, saying that “none of them would have to tell somebody that they are losing their job, and none of them would have to shutter a business for the last time”. He later said that it was “not right for me to make personalised criticisms of members of Nphet” and “not fair” to question their motivations and their understanding about how their decisions impacted on people”. The housing crisis preceded Varadkar’s time as Taoiseach but it will continue long after he is gone. During his time in office, the numbers of people living in emergency accommodation has increased, while house prices and rents have risen. The pandemic halted construction for a time and the Coalition can point to progress with the supply of new homes increasing. But the buck stops with Varadkar and the crisis remains as he prepares to leave office. Similarly, health remains a black spot on the Government’s record; there have been record levels of overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick this year, just as they were stresses in the health system when Varadkar was minister for health a decade ago. Varadkar’s election as Fine Gael leader did not bring the kind of electoral magic the party had hoped for. Fine Gael performed well in the 2019 European Elections; it took five of Ireland’s 13 European Parliament seats but it was downhill from there. Fine Gael failed to win Dáil seats in all four by-elections later that year and in the 2020 general election, the party won 35 Dáil seats, losing 15 seats. The party, under Varadkar, failed to retain Eoghan Murphy’s seat in Dublin Bay South, a Fine Gael heartland, which was won by Labour’s Ivana Bacik in a by-election The overwhelming rejection of the proposed changes to the Constitution in this month’s family and care referendums were the latest electoral blow for Varadkar. Many politicians suffer from foot-in-mouth at times and Varadkar is no different. While his love of novelty socks (shown off during a meeting with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau) could be forgiven, the Taoiseach regularly misspoke. He spoke of his “thrill” at being in the location of the Christmas romcom “Love Actually” during his first visit to Downing Street in 2017. The following year, he tied himself up in knots when he (incorrectly) revealed during a US trip that he had contacted Clare County Council over a proposed wind farm near the then US president Donald Trump’s Doonbeg golf course following a call from Trump himself when Varadkar was minister for tourism. That year, he wrote to pop star Kylie Minogue to ask if he could welcome her to Ireland personally when she was travelling to Dublin for a concert. In 2023, Varadkar apologised for an “ill-judged” joke about interns in Washington at a function in the US capital. He quipped he was an intern in the city in the last year of Bill Clinton’s presidency “when some parents would have had cause for concern about what would happen to interns in Washington”. There were red faces in the Varadkar household last year when the Taoiseach’s partner Matt Barrett had to apologise for lighted-hearted social media posts on Instagram while attending the coronation of King Charles III. Barrett posted from inside Westminster Abbey, though guests were told to put their phones away. In one post, Barrett compared Charles’s crown to the sorting hat in the Harry Potter books.",0,1
2024/3/20,"Inside Leo Varadkar’s shock decision to resign: why now? Varadkar’s popularity within Fine Gael has been declining steadily since 2020 After the shock waves had subsided in Leinster House and the texts stopped flying came the question: why now? Leo Varadkar’s resignation has been described by his Fine Gael party colleagues as “a bolt from the blue” while Government Ministers said they were left in “total shock” upon hearing the bombshell news at the weekly meeting. It would have been a jaw-dropper on any day of the week but the timing of his decision has left many people scratching their heads. There were no ominous comments on the public airwaves from potential leadership rivals, no urgent whispers of a proper heave and no immediate crisis threatening to unseat him at any moment. In this context, the timing was somewhat bizarre. It is now known, however, that Varadkar has been weighing up his options since Christmas. If he was to go, a source familiar with his thinking said, then he wanted to do it at a time that both allowed him to explain his reasons while also giving his successor a reasonable chance of success. Going before the St Patrick’s Day trip to the White House was not considered a viable option. On the other hand, leaving it until after a potential drubbing in the local elections would kick-start a process of political bloodletting in public that could have made his exit a far more embarrassing affair. This is the picture that people close to him paint: a man who was worn down by the grind who wanted to decide his exit on his own terms. That is not the full picture though. The slow dimming of Varadkar’s appeal within Fine Gael began after the last general election in 2020, and his popularity has been declining since then. By the summer of 2021 former Fine Gael TD Eoghan Murphy had become the third senior Varadkar loyalist to quit the party after Brian Hayes and Michael D’Arcy. They didn’t see a future in Fine Gael despite being seen as the Taoiseach’s right hand men. The number of Fine Gael TDs elected in 2020 who have said they are stepping down at the next election has now reached 11, including Murphy. This rises to 12 if Varadkar decides not to stand again. With every announcement, the low level rumblings over Varadkar’s leadership became that bit louder. Was this a Varadkar issue? Or were these politicians fleeing a sinking ship and a potentially lengthy stint on the opposition benches? Then there was Covid-19. Like many other politicians, the intense experience of steering the ship through a global pandemic appears to have taken its toll. By the time the office of Taoiseach rotated back to him, journalists were openly putting it to him that his heart didn’t seem to be in the job the way it had been before. Upon announcing his decision not to stand in the next general election, Galway East TD Ciaran Cannon this week cited the toxicity of modern politics. If you make a cursory search for Leo Varadkar’s name on social media, the comments from faceless accounts can range from highly personalised insults to death threats. Social media has also made the pace of politics relentless. And then came this month’s overwhelming rejection of the Government’s proposed changes to the Constitution in the family and care referendums, which yielded the highest ever percentage No vote in the history of the State. Publicly, Varadkar said he accepted responsibility as head of the Government and that there would be a period of reflection. Given the fact most of the opposition supported the proposals, they were not baying for his blood in any significant way. The situation within Fine Gael was far different, a number of sources have said. The finger of blame was being pointed at him and his political judgment has very much been a topic among senior Fine Gael politicians. Given the threat posed by Sinn Féin, there is very little desire in Fine Gael to engage in a public process of tearing itself apart just weeks before the local and European elections. The proximity of those elections has clearly had a major bearing on his decision to go now. “There are loyal colleagues and good friends contesting the local and European elections. I want to give them the best chance possible,” he said. “I think they will now have a better chance under a new leader.”",0,1
2024/3/20,"Some in Varadkar’s constituency shocked by resignation, others ‘happy to see him go’ In affluent Castleknock, there was shock; in socially disadvantaged Corduff, there was indifference Reaction to Leo Varadkar’s resignation was a story of two tales in his Dublin West constituency. In affluent Castleknock, there was shock and sadness; in socially disadvantaged Corduff, there was indifference and even hope that his resignation could result in a general election. Around the shops at the Castleknock village centre, the vast majority of people The Irish Times spoke to expressed high regard for their high-profile TD. “I have to say I am very fond of him,” said Rosemary Killalea, who is originally from Donegal but has been living in the area “for many years”. “He has been a good TD. We are very lucky in this area that we have good housing, good jobs, good services and not everywhere has that. What I liked about him is his outspokenness, his honesty,” she said. “I cannot understand why he’s retiring. I know he’s losing 10 of his TDs – maybe that has something to do with it and the referendums have to have done a lot of damage. But Leo, I am sorry he’s leaving. I honestly am.” Friends Con Clarke and Jim Clancy, outside a coffee shop, were “just talking about Leo”. “I am very surprised, for a young fellah like that,” Mr Clancy said. “These two referendums may have been the issue. I am shocked to see him go, and a bit sad. He was a breath of fresh air.” Asked whether he was a good TD, Mr Clarke said: “That’s debatable. What’s a good TD? He wouldn’t be like the Healy-Raes, constantly shouting about his area. He’s more about national policy.” Just 5km away in Corduff, shoppers said Mr Varadkar had done “nothing” for the area, particularly on crime and housing. Paschal Collins, brother of former professional boxer Stephen, runs the Celtic Warrior boxing gym. He described Mr Varadkar as “all right” but says of Government parties: “None has been good for Corduff. “I didn’t know Leo was resigning and it makes no difference. It could be a great thing,” he said. Richard O’Leary, a Traveller and member of the gym, said the resignation “can only be good [as] nothing’s come out of all his years as leader for this area”. Asked if he had ever voted Fine Gael, he said: “Not a chance.” He said he had lived “almost my whole my life” on a local halting site. He described the condition of the site as “really, really bad”. “Nothing changed there the whole time Leo has been a TD here.” A primary schoolteacher said she had raised the issues of crime and housing with Mr Varadkar and that “he never done anything about it so maybe the next person will”. “I’m happy to see him go,” she said. Andrew, a shop worker, said: “To me, Leo would seem to be looking after Castleknock more than people around here.",0,1
2024/3/20,"Leo Varadkar: ‘I don’t feel I’m the best person for that job any more’ Full text of the Taoiseach’s resignation statement: ‘My reasons for stepping down are both personal and political’  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today announced his resignation as leader of Fine Gael, effective today, and as Taoiseach. He will stay as Taoiseach until a new leader is chosen by the party, which it is hoped will be completed by the party’s ardfheis in early April. The Dáil will then, it is planned, elect the new Fine Gael leader as taoiseach. Mr Varadkar announced his decision in a personal and emotional address outside Government Buildings. Here is the full text of his statement: “Thank you for coming. I’d like to read a brief statement. I’ve had the privilege to serve for the past 20 years as a public representative, 13 as a member of cabinet, seven as leader of my party, and most of those as Taoiseach of this great country. It has been the most fulfilling time of my life. “Working with colleagues, I’ve had the honour of helping to lead Ireland from unemployment to full employment, from budget deficit to budget surplus, from austerity to prosperity, through a pandemic in which we saved lives and livelihoods through Brexit when we prevented a hard border between North and South and protected our place in Europe. “I’m proud we’ve made the country a more equal and more modern place when it comes to the rights of children, the LGBT community, equality for women and their bodily autonomy. More recently, we’ve led the country through an inflation cost-of-living crisis, the worst of which is now thankfully behind us. “We’ve made significant steps towards affordable child care and universal healthcare, making access to both more affordable for more people. We’ve made work pay better with the implementation of a national living wage, statutory sick pay, lower personal taxes, improved family leave, allowing parents to spend more time with their children in those crucial early years. “I’m happy that during my time as Taoiseach, we were able to honour my commitments to double spending on the arts, culture and sport. This is making a real difference now and will continue to do so into the future, fostering and assisting the artists and the sportsmen and women of the future. “We provided leadership by increasing our spending on international development, how we’ve expanded our diplomatic footprint around the world, building on Ireland’s already considerable soft power. “The national broadband plan is under way, bringing fibre-based internet connections to every home, school, business, farm and community in Ireland which the critics said shouldn’t be done. We’ve established the technological universities and the Rural Development Fund, and since 2011, we’ve quadrupled overall annual investment in public infrastructure. “That’s meant considerably more investment in priorities like housing, healthcare facilities, school buildings and climate action. And I am deeply proud that we, as Irish people, welcomed over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees to our shores when they needed our protection, notwithstanding the challenges this brings. “In my time as Taoiseach we reduced consistent poverty and income inequality. Housing construction is more than doubled, with 500 people becoming homeowners each week for the first time, the highest number in almost two decades. “Of course, there are areas in which we have been much less successful, and some in which we have sadly gone backwards. But I hope you’ll forgive me if I leave it to others to point them out on a day like this. They will receive plenty of airtime and column space. “When I became party leader and taoiseach back in June 2017. I knew that one part of leadership is knowing when the time has come to pass on the baton to somebody else, and then having the courage to do it. That time is now. So I am resigning as president and leader, Fine Gael, effective today. I will resign as Taoiseach as soon as my successor is able to take up that office. “I’ve asked our party general secretary and executive council to provide for the new leader to be elected in advance of the ardfheis on Saturday, April 16th, thus allowing a new taoiseach to be elected when the Dáil resumes after the Easter break. “I know this will come as a surprise to many people and a disappointment to some, and I hope at least you’ll understand my decision. I know that others will, how shall I put it, cope with the news just fine. That is the great thing about living in a democracy. “There’s never a right time to resign my office. However, this is as good a time as any. Budget 2024 is done. Negotiations have not yet commenced on the next one. The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are working again, and our trading relationship with the UK in the post-Brexit era is settled and stable. “The new Taoiseach will have a full two months to prepare for the local and European elections, and up to a year before the next general election. “My reasons for stepping down are both personal and political. I believe this Government can be re-elected, and I believe my party Fine Gael can gain seats in the next Dáil. Most of all, I believe the re-election of this three-party Government would be the right thing for the future of our country, continuing to take us forward, protecting all that’s been achieved and building on it. “But after careful consideration and some soul searching, I believe that a new Taoiseach and a new leader will be better placed than me to achieve that. To renew and strengthen the team. To focus our message on policies, to drive implementation. And after seven years in office, I don’t feel I’m the best person for that job any more. “There are loyal colleagues and good friends contesting local European elections, and I want to give them the best chance possible. And I think they have a better chance under a new leader. I am standing aside in the absolute confidence that the country and the economy are in a good place, and that my colleagues in Government from all three parties – Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Greens – and the Oireachtas will continue to work hard for the nation’s best interests. “On a personal level, I’ve enjoyed being Taoiseach, leader and a cabinet member since March 2011. I’ve learned so much about so many things, met so many people who I’d never have got to meet, been to places I would never have seen, both home and abroad, and I am deeply grateful for it – and despite the challenges would wholeheartedly recommend a career in politics to anyone who’s considering it. “However, politicians are human beings and we have our limitations. We give it everything until we can’t any more and then we have to move on. I will, of course, continue to fulfil my duties as Taoiseach until a new one is elected and will remain as consistency TD for Dublin West. “I know inevitably there will be speculation as to the ‘quote unquote’ real reason for my decision. These are the real reasons. That’s it. I have nothing else lined up. I have nothing in mind. I have no definite personal or political plans, but I’m really looking forward to having the time to think about them. “I’d like to take this opportunity to thank my party, my colleagues and partners, particularly Micheál and Eamon, my constituents, colleagues and staff for their loyalty and their phenomenal work. And I’m going to thank them all in person in the near future. Most of all, I want to finish by thanking the people of Ireland for giving me the opportunity to serve them. And I promise I’ll keep working for Ireland and my community in any way I can in the future. Thank you very much.”",0,1
2024/3/20,"In pictures: Leo Varadkar’s 20 years in politics From his early days in Fine Gael as a councillor to his resignation as taoiseach and leader of his party Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has stood down as leader of Fine Gael. In a personal and emotional address outside Government Buildings, Varadkar said that serving in Government “has been the most fulfilling time of my life”.",0,1
2024/3/20,"Covid pandemic was Varadkar’s biggest test as Taoiseach when there were few answers Fine Gael leader at times clashed with Nphet’s public health advice and accepts government got some calls wrong Leo Varadkar was a guest at the black tie Ireland Funds gala dinner in Washington in March 2020 when he was whisked away by officials to take an urgent phone call. Three years later, at the same event, he recalled that his public health chiefs back in Dublin had summoned him to the phone to tell him that the moment they had feared had arrived. The Covid pandemic had hit Ireland and the country needed to take drastic action to try to stem its spread. In the early hours in Washington, Varadkar addressed the country from the steps of Blair House, a US government building for important guests close to the White House. The Taoiseach announced that schools would close and Ireland would begin to go into lockdown with pubs and other social events shut down. It would be the most testing time of his period in office. He told the nation that there was no vaccine at the time and no known cure. All that could be done to save lives – particularly of older people and those who were vulnerable from pre-existing conditions – was to encourage the public to stay apart from each other. The Taoiseach announced  that his Government was closing down the economy except for the most essential services. Varadkar received praise for his calm address to a fearful nation on television on St Patrick’s night in which he admitted the Government did not know how long the crisis would last and acknowledged it would put severe pressure on the health service and those who worked in it. “Not all superheroes wear capes, some wear scrubs and gowns,” he said. However, when the pandemic was over he acknowledged that mistakes had been made. Speaking in New York last September, where he attended the United Nations Sustainable Development Conference, he said that on reflection there should have been no easing of restrictions in advance of Christmas 2020 in light of the emergence of the Alpha variant of the virus. He also suggested that Ireland was slow to introduce mask wearing as well as antigen tests. He also said the final Omicron lockdown was probably not necessary. The Taoiseach said that, in relation to Christmas 2020, both the Government and National Public Health Emergency Team had made “the wrong call”. “Nphet proposed one form of reopening which would have meant a lot of social interactions in private houses while the Government proposed a different reopening plan which involved some hospitality and some private houses.” In January 2021, after the Christmas season, more than 1,500 deaths were recorded due to Covid – the single worst month during the pandemic. On occasions during the pandemic politicians were frustrated at the decisions made by Nphet – the most public manifestation came in October 2020 when Varadkar harshly criticised a recommendation made the previous Sunday that the entire State should go from level two to level five, the most severe lockdown, to combat the spread of Covid-19. Following a meeting between the three Government party leaders and then chief medical officer Tony Holohan the following day the Cabinet rejected the advice and opted for the State to move to level three instead. Varadkar went on television that night and hit out at the Nphet recommendation as not being “thought through”, saying it had been “landed” on the Government. At the time, Mr Varadkar said no member of Nphet “would have faced being on the pandemic unemployment payment benefit ... and none of them would have to shutter a business for the last time”. Varadkar later said he had gone too far in his comments. He later said he had made the comments in circumstances where the Nphet advice had “changed very dramatically overnight” and without consulting the Government. “But it was not right for me to make personalised criticisms of members of Nphet and questioning their motivations and their understanding about how their decisions impacted on people. That was not fair.”",0,1
2024/3/20,"Leo Varadkar: Clear-thinking, decisive politician without the common touch Varadkar achieved much personally but leaves unfinished business in housing and health with limited electoral success for Fine Gael In his first week in the Dáil in 2007, Leo Varadkar set out the traits that would – more or less – mark him out as a politician. He was 28 years of age and in a Dáil debate, he faced Bertie Ahern, who had just won his third general election in a row. Varadkar went for the jugular. Ahern was “devious and cunning” and his story about his personal finances did not stack up, he asserted. “What the Taoiseach has done is no different from what Liam Lawlor, Charles Haughey, Michael Lowry and Ray Burke did.” The attack was notable not only for being precocious but also for identifying Varadkar as a true-blue ideological Christian Democrat. Of Ahern, he said: “History will judge him, in some ways, as a successful Taoiseach. It will also judge his years as Taoiseach as a lost opportunity to achieve great things done in other booms such as the Adenauer years in Germany or the postwar years in America.” His assessment of Ahern was prescient, given what happened later that year. As for Varadkar, it is a bit early to deliver a full assessment of his time at the helm of the country. Even now, though, we know that like Ahern he will be judged in some ways as a successful taoiseach but also as one who failed in several key aspects. He himself has pointed to success with the economy, with achieving full employment, with social progress and the manner in which his governments have grappled with Brexit, Covid, the war in Ukraine and with Gaza. As against that, in his time as Taoiseach he has presided over record homelessness, steeply rising house prices and rents, and a litany of failed promises on housing, particularly pledges to build more homes and falling well short of the estimated 50,000 homes a year that are required to address the years-long housing crisis. While the health services are extravagantly funded, the HSE seems to be in a state of permanent crisis, as illustrated by record trolley numbers at University Hospital Limerick as recently as last month. Of late, immigration has become one of the great challenges of the global political landscape of the post-Covid 2020s. More than 100,000 war refugees from Ukraine have arrived  in Ireland since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and there has been a sudden spike in the number of asylum seekers. The Government has struggled to cope with hundreds of mostly young men forced to sleep on the streets and in makeshift campsites. Shortcomings in the Government’s immigration policy and its implementation – exacerbated by the housing crisis – has been exploited by the far right, which in turn has complicated the management of this policy. Varadkar has called time as Taoiseach at the start of his third decade in politics and his 21st year as an elected representative. The son of an Indian GP and a nurse from Co Waterford, he was already committed to a career in politics by the time he graduated in medicine from Trinity College Dublin. In an interview with The Irish Times in 2010 he said: “Some people arrive into a party through an intellectual process. I had an ideological connection to a party. A big part of it was the values of the party. It told people the truth even when they did not want to hear it.” In his 20s, Varadkar was a classic Christian Democrat, a free market proponent and socially conservative. His faith in the free market has never wavered. “Fine Gael needs to be Fine Gael and needs to stand its ground. It should not sacrifice its politics for a position in Government. We need to stand over our policies when negotiating a programme for Government,” he said. However, his social outlook was usurped by his own lived experience in the rapidly changing Ireland of the new millennium, not least his coming out as a gay man. As a politician Varadkar portrayed himself as a straight-talker, sometimes to the cost of his Fine Gael colleagues, not least Alan Shatter during the Garda whistleblower controversy. The adjectives used to describe his attributes were bright, articulate, policy-oriented, clear-thinking and very ambitious. There were other not-so-complimentary adjectives: arrogant, precocious, abrasive, insensitive. Varadkar was on the wrong side of the leadership tussle between Enda Kenny and Richard Bruton in 2010 but was nonetheless appointed back to the Fine Gael front bench. As a minister he had mixed fortunes: competent in Transport and Sport and – later – in Enterprise. However, he was another in a long list of health ministers who struggled and failed to make a success of that portfolio. The anti-fraud Department of Social Welfare campaign that he fronted as minister there in 2017 – claiming that “Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All” – and his declaration to lead a party for “people who get up early in the morning” in his campaign to be leader of Fine Gael showed his capacity to court controversy. He defeated Simon Coveney to become leader of the party and Taoiseach in June 2017, at the age of 38. He won the vote of the Oireachtas but Coveney won the popular vote. His personal electoral success has never transferred into the same kind of success for Fine Gael; the party lost votes (almost 90,000) and seats (15) in 2020, the only general election Varadkar led the party into. Varadkar can be socially awkward and does not have the common touch. He has always found it difficult to do small talk, to show public emotion or empathy, or do the tactile ‘meet and greet’ that so many Irish politicians do naturally. This reporter was on a visit with him to Ethiopia where he walked around a refugee camp wearing sunglasses with his hands in his pocket, looking like a bored teenager. However, in the end-of-day interviews it was clear the experience had really impacted deeply on him even though he had not shown it in the same way as others. His resignation statement on the steps of Government Buildings on Wednesday was one of the very few times in his career in which he has shown public emotion. His ability to articulate clear views and set out thought-through strategies – without sugaring them – has balanced that social awkwardness throughout his career. He was taoiseach when abortion was legalised, during critical Brexit negotiations, and when the pandemic struck and was able to project calmness and a sense of being in control during those crises. The party has had mixed electoral success during his tenure, and would have gone into opposition in 2020 were it not for the complicated and indecisive results of the election. The retirement of 10 TDs in the run-up to the next election did not bode well for Fine Gael’s electoral prospects, which was already on a downward trajectory after 13 years in power. There is no doubt that the need to find a new stimulus to ward off a big election defeat must have played a part in his decision to leave the stage at this time.",0,1
2024/3/20,"Leo Varadkar’s bombshell resignation turns the political world upside down Anticipated bounceback once Varadkar regained Taoiseach’s office in 2022 has not materialised for a directionless Fine Gael Leo Varadkar’s bombshell announcement that he will step down as leader of Fine Gael (FG) with immediate effect has turned the political world momentarily upside down. The move shocked Government and Opposition politicians alike; none more so than his potential successors in Fine Gael, who are all, for now, maintaining a judicious silence about their future intentions. They will have to make up their minds soon enough, though; politics is a forward looking business, and it moves on quickly to the next thing. And the next thing is: who will lead Fine Gael? Both Fianna Fáil (FF) and the Green Party have made clear that they expect the Coalition agreement to continue under the new leader of Fine Gael. So the proposed order of events is: Fine Gael picks a new leader in time for its ardfheis on April 6th – Varadkar resigns as Taoiseach when the Dáil meets the following week – the Dáil (with its FF-FG-Green majority, plus the support of some Independents) elects the new Fine Gael leader as Taoiseach, and then approves the Cabinet. And things continue as heretofore. This sober scenario means that the Government is required to be collectively imbued with the level-headedness necessary to ignore the likely deafening clamour for a general election from the Opposition. That might seem unlikely given the febrile political atmosphere created by Wednesday’s announcement, but things will clam down; they always do. Politicians will make judgments about their own interests. It is very clearly in the political interests of the Coalition to avoid an immediate general election. Indeed, the change of leader probably lengthens on the odds on an election taking place this year. The new taoiseach will want to spend a bit of time being taoiseach before they try to get re-elected. The Green and FF leaders are likely to seek clarity from the prospective new taoiseach on the date for the general election before they march their troops through the division lobbies. That may push the date into next year – early March, perhaps before the St Patrick’s Day exodus. The last possible date is March 22nd, 2025. So why did Varadkar do it? Around Leinster House, and beyond, it’s the question on everyone’s lips. In his press conference, the now outgoing Taoiseach cited “personal and political” reasons; the political ones, at least, have been mounting up. His party has had obvious problems for some time. The anticipated bounceback once Varadkar regained the Taoiseach’s office in late 2022 has not materialised. In the meantime, there has been a mini-exodus of FG TDs, with 10 announcing they will not contest the election. Varadkar’s departure – it is assumed he will not stand in the next general election – brings it to more than a third of the 35 TDs who won seats in 2020 who will not now stand again. In a system that rewards incumbency, that makes for an uphill struggle. The truth is, really, that Fine Gael is a party in deep trouble. The polls are flaccid; persistently so. More importantly, after three terms in Government it lacks a sense of direction, purpose and forward momentum. That can only come from the top. But as some TDs and Ministers have privately admitted in recent months when the subject of Varadkar’s leadership was quietly discussed, many have seen no sign of that. In a way, despite being in the midst of its most successful political run ever, Fine Gael is in a sort of slow-moving crisis, only discernible if you really look for it. Varadkar’s departure is both a symptom of, but also worsens, that situation. To that political analysis is added the reality of Varadkar’s personal circumstances. He has already spent half his life in politics. Since coming out as a gay man in 2015, his life has changed hugely. He has found the inconveniences of political fame more, not less, irritating as time has gone on. Of late, some colleagues and acquaintances have doubted his appetite for the political fray; he is less totally consumed by politics than he once was. Though this is not the place to ruminate on his achievements or otherwise, it is incontestable that he will leave the stage after a career that was more consequential than many. Politicians live and die by elections. Varadkar’s 2020 general election performance as leader of his party disappointed many of the supporters who backed him as the candidate who could reach parts of the electorate previously unavailable to Fine Gael. Varadkar is naturally a self-critical person; it is clearly his analysis that the next election would be no better for him. He has not shied away from the consequences of that conclusion. His party’s difficulties remain. But that will be someone else’s job now.",0,1
2024/3/20,"Leo Varadkar resignation: Fine Gael TDs ‘shocked’ and ‘surprised’ by announcement Unexpected statement by Taoiseach ‘a bolt out of the blue’ for many of party’s elected officials Fine Gael TDs have said they were “completely shocked” and “surprised” by Leo Varadkar’s Wednesday afternoon announcement on his decision to step down as Taoiseach and leader of the party. Speaking outside Government Buildings on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar cited both “personal and political” reasons. Dublin Fingal TD Alan Farrell said he was “completely taken aback” by Mr Varakar’s announcement and that TDs were not told in advance. “I had no inclination of it at all, other than what appeared on my phone at about maybe 11.40am that he was intent on resigning,” he said. “I don’t really know what to make of it, I respect personal decisions not to continue in a particular role. I’ve seen that with a number of colleagues who’ve decided to stand down or retire. His is no different, but obviously the decision is much more significant in terms of the party and what we’ll do next.” The Fine Gael TD added: “The decision is made ... I won’t say that my preference is for someone else to lead the party into the next local, European and general elections. But, we’re now in the position where that will be the case so it’s just a matter for the individuals who might put their names forward to approach members of the parliamentary party and announce their candidacies as we have experienced before.” Louth TD Fergus O’Dowd said he was “absolutely surprised” by the announcement and that it was “a complete shock”. “I don’t think anybody had any idea, it’s a bolt out of the blue. He’s done his bit, made his decision and handing his reins over. “It’s a shock at the moment but obviously a contest is a healthy thing in politics and it will bring out policy differences in policy and priorities. “You can appoint a leader but I think if you vote, and every party member can vote, it will renew the party and it can be done and will have to be done very quickly. It’s good for renewal even if it’s unexpected. I was always down as a supporter of Leo and had confidence in his capacity and ability. I’m disappointed but we will have to move on.” Galway East TD Ciarán Cannon, who announced earlier this week that he will not run in the next general election, said Mr Varadkar had “given his all”. “It’s been a privilege to serve with him. Anyone who knows him as a colleague, knows how committed he was, how ambitious he was for Ireland,” he said. “I think we saw in him today the frailty, the things that make us human. You saw a man who had given it his all and had the courage and maturity to say so.” Sligo-Leitrim TD Frank Feighan said he was surprised to hear of the announcement and looked forward to the upcoming leadership contest. “Politics is a bit like life, it’s surprising,” he said. “I can understand his reasons and he has given plenty of time for the Government to continue and plenty of time ahead of the European and local elections. “In fairness to him he always put the country first. He did an awful lot of good in politics. The country and economy is in a good place and did his best for Fine Gael and the country. It will be an interesting time over the next few weeks and months, the next few weeks especially. “Fine Gael has always had robust and democratic leadership challenges and I look forward to what the next few weeks bring.” Speaking in the Dáil, Kerry TD Brendan Griffin said people “don’t really see the huge personal sacrifice that goes into the job of leadership” and wished the Taoiseach well.",0,1
2024/3/21,"No regrets as Varadkar limbers up for the last dance in Brussels  Suddenly, the Taoiseach seems tired of it all. Tired of Brussels, even Leo Varadkar bounced out of the Sofitel hotel in Brussels on Thursday morning, en route to the giant concrete and steel palaces that house the institutions of the European Union. A gaggle of reporters were gathered outside on the off-chance of a word with passing EU bigwigs. Are you looking for a new job in Europe? “No, definitely not,” Varadkar replied with a chuckle, “but thanks!” A new job seems to be the last thing on his mind. A while later, he strode down the red carpet of the Europa building that houses the regular summits of EU leaders, flanked by the flags of the 27 member states. The massed ranks of reporters, microphones and cameras awaited him, not quite for the last time (it’s a two-day summit), but counting down, all the same. “So, looking forward to the European Council meeting today and tomorrow...” Varadkar began. Predictably, nearly all the questions were about his departure. What did he think of the emerging trend for Simon Harris at home? He wouldn’t be endorsing any candidate. Would a contest be good for the party? It could be beneficial, he conceded. But not essential. (Just as well.) Before long, he was answering the question that lots of people – politicians, officials, journalists – are asking in Brussels and, also, at home: why did he really go? And why now? The reasons, he insisted, were as he had already stated. It was just time for a change. “There’s no event, there’s no one thing. I appreciate the need for journalism to have ‘a thing’ or a moment but in real life it’s often not like that,” he said. It was to be a recurring theme. Just because the journalists say something is so, doesn’t mean it is. It is not an unusual theme among politicians who are on the way out. They all go through a stage of frustration with the media. Or maybe they just don’t care to hide it any more. And suddenly, Varadkar seems tired of it all. Tired of Brussels, even. There was a time when he would talk privately with almost boyish enthusiasm about the unique arrangements of a meeting of the European Council, the group of heads of governments that is the EU’s most important decision-making body. At the meetings of the Council of Ministers – where all the transport or health or whatever ministers meet – which he attended while a minister, officials sit behind the ministers passing notes and offering advice during the discussion between the principals. At the council, there’s no officials – just the leaders. They go into the room and – sometimes hours later – emerge having agreed a text, or not. It’s raw, high politics, up close and personal. Varadkar loved it. Not any more, it seems. “I’m here in Brussels today,” he said. “I’ve been coming to Brussels for nearly 14 years now without a break, representing the country as a minister and then as Taoiseach and tánaiste. There comes a time when you need to move on and you need to make space for new people and new ideas and new energy and that’s what I want to do. “What I’m saying is it’s time for change. Time for somebody new. I think it will be good for the party, more importantly it will be good for the Government, good for the country. I’ve had the privilege for over 13 years to represent Ireland around the world, to come to Brussels to attend meetings like this. “But it can’t be forever, and I don’t want it to be forever. You know I left Leinster House last night at nearly 10pm. I went home, had a takeaway, had a chat with my partner and got up at 8am, or no, before 8am, at 6.45 to get on a plane at 8 o’clock – you know, you don’t need to do that forever.” This inhuman schedule found mixed sympathy among the reporters present, many of whom had also gotten home after 10pm and – not having recourse to a private jet – had to get up even earlier than 6.45am to get a flight to Brussels. Some of them didn’t even get a takeaway last night, would you believe. But look it, it’s not about them. Did he feel relief? “I don’t know, it hasn’t sunk in yet. Like I say, I left Government Buildings last night half-nine, ten o’clock, went home, quick takeaway, had a chat with my partner, read my brief for this morning, was on a flight at 8am – it hasn’t sunk in yet. But it will sink in.” This must have been one terrible takeaway. In fairness, that can happen. They’re hit and miss at the best of times. He was self-reflective, as always. The decision he had to make, he said, was to judge whether his party had a better chance of prospering, and perhaps winning an unprecedented fourth term in government, with a different leader. After some consideration, that’s the conclusion he reached. On Thursday in Brussels, even as he limbered up for the last dance with the European leaders among whom he has always felt at home, that conclusion looked anything like reluctant.",0,1
2024/3/21,"Varadkar says ‘no one thing’ triggered resignation and that it is ‘time for somebody new’ Taoiseach tells reporters at summit of EU leaders in Brussels he has been doing the job long enough  Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that there is “no one thing” that triggered his resignation on Wednesday but that he had been doing the job long enough and it was time for a change. Speaking to reporters as he entered the summit of EU leaders in Brussels, Mr Varadkar said: “There’s no event, there’s no one thing. I appreciate the need for journalism to have ‘a thing’ or a moment but in real life it’s often not like that.” “But for me, I’m here in Brussels today,” Mr Varadkar went on, “I’ve been coming to Brussels for nearly 14 years now without a break, representing the country as a minister and then as Taoiseach and Tánaiste. There comes a time when you need to move on and you need to make space for new people and new ideas and new energy and that’s what I want to do.” Mr Varadkar prefaced his remarks with an outline of the issues that EU leaders were planning to discuss, with a particular focus on Gaza. He said that Ireland’s position on Gaza was “the minority view” at the EU summits before Christmas but now it was “very much the majority view”. He was hopeful of a joint EU statement calling for a humanitarian ceasefire, he said, adding that Ireland would be pushing hard for such an outcome. “Hopefully we can get that agreed, but the EU works on the basis of unanimity,” Mr Vardakar said. He said that Israel had “squandered the international support it had” in the wake of the attacks by Hamas on October 7th and added that he believed Israel was in “flagrant breach” of the human rights clause in the EU-Israel trade agreement. Mr Varadkar said that the leaders would also discuss defence matters, and the proposals for common defence procurement for EU countries. “There’ll be a discussion on defence. I don’t think that’s something Ireland should be afraid of,” he said. “While we are a neutral country, we have an army, we have a navy, we have an Air Corps, we need weapons, ships, aircraft and it makes sense for Ireland to be part of that ... We need to take our security seriously,” he said. Most of the questions addressed to him concerned his shock announcement on Wednesday. He reiterated his message from the announcement – that it was time to let someone else take over leading his party and the Taoiseach’s office. “What I’m saying is it’s time for change. Time for somebody new. I think it will be good for the party, more importantly it will be good for the Government, good for the country,” he said. “I’ve had the privilege for over 13 years to represent Ireland around the world to come to Brussels to attend meetings like this. But it can’t be forever, and I don’t want it to be forever. “You know, I left Leinster House last night at nearly 10pm.

2024/3/21,"Ireland’s only arms contract with Israel is €295,000 a year for drone maintenance - Martin Sinn Féin TD Aengus Ó Snodaigh says State should never have purchased equipment from Israel Ireland’s only current armaments contract with Israeli weapons manufacturers is an annual €295,000 fee for the support and maintenance of drones it purchased from an arms company, the Tánaiste has said. Micheál Martin expressed “reservations” in the Dáil about Israel over its armaments industry and the procurement of equipment for the Irish Defence Forces but he insisted that the State follows international laws for the purchase of armaments. He said that “tender competitions are up to any company or country subject to the terms of all United Nations or OSCE and European Union arms embargoes, or restrictions. There are no such restrictions or embargo is in place on Israel or Israeli companies.” The Government anticipates an annual €295,000 charge for the maintenance of its drones, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), under its only current armaments contract with Israel. However, in the past decade the Department of Defence has paid at least €8.5 million to Israeli weapons manufacturers for the UAVs, advanced targeting equipment, ground radar systems and communications systems as well as maintenance and training. Sinn Féin TD Aengus Ó Snodaigh said “there is no ethical component to the purchasing of weapons from Israel or any other country which is at war, given the slaughter that’s happening in Gaza at present”. The Dublin South-Central TD has over the years repeatedly raised in the Dáil the issue of Ireland’s purchase of military equipment from Israel. Given the “history of Israeli actions in relation to Palestine, there should have never been any purchase of any equipment for the Irish Defence Forces”, he said. “The fact that we purchased aerial vehicle drones from them and that they are still involved in the maintenance of those and therefore can gather information off their uses and then put that information to use in attacking civilians in Gaza is very, very suspect.” But Mr Martin said “I think it’s a stretch to suggest UAVs at some point add knowledge in terms of how we use those, with subsequent use in attacks in Gaza”. Sinn Féin defence spokesman Matt Carthy said that since 2018 six members of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) had undertaken training in Ireland in the UN training school, under Nato’s Partnership for Peace programme. “I have to say it’s abhorrent to me that Ireland would have facilitated the training of members of the IDF over the past 13 years, throughout which Palestinian were being subjected to brutal oppression and onslaught by the IDF.” Mr Martin said that it was a UN training programme and “we don’t get to choose which members of the United Nations want to participate in a training programme”, and it was open to people to apply if they were UN members. Mr Ó Snodaigh said Ireland needs to suspend all such trade “and we also need to campaign in the EU in the UN for all such trade to be suspended ... especially in terms of defence contracts.” The Tánaiste said that Ireland and Spain had written to the EU Commission president calling for a review of the trade association agreement with Israel. “In terms of our view of Israelis noncompliance with the Human Rights clauses within that trade association, we are campaigning in respect of this issue and using every mechanism we have available to us to raise these issues.”",0,1
2024/3/21,"What next for Leo Varadkar? ‘I have nothing else lined up’  There will be no shortage of paths open to Taoiseach after he leaves office During the course of his bombshell announcement, Leo Varadkar acknowledged that the speculation about where he will end up will be almost as fevered as why he resigned. “I have nothing else lined up. I have nothing in mind. I have no definite personal or political plans, but I’m really looking forward to having the time to think about them,” he told reporters in the courtyard of Government Buildings. That, of course, does nothing to dampen the speculation – and there are no shortage of paths open to him. “He’ll be more successful outside Fine Gael than in it,” opined one Government source on Wednesday afternoon. One route is Europe, where two paths were sketched out by observers. He could seek to be made Ireland’s next European commissioner later this year – however, that position is Fianna Fáil’s to fill and Varadkar appeared to rule it out on Wednesday. The other route is through one of the many European posts that will open up after the EU Parliament elections this year. As a former two-time head of government in a member state, his stock is high. He also has a record of relative political stability to point to on his own patch – while Ireland has undergone an upheaval in its politics, it has not been as dramatic or as fractious as in many other member states – at least not yet, anyway.  While the bailout and austerity eras presaged two damaging elections for Fine Gael, in Europe Ireland was seen as a country that stuck with its programme and bounced back. Varadkar’s governments have tacked towards the mainstream on corporate tax, traditionally a black mark for Ireland, and he has been supportive of conversations about greater co-operation on defence. His central role in the Brexit drama also burnished his reputation in Brussels. Insiders also believe the characteristics of European politics as distinct from domestic matters will appeal to Varadkar, who colleagues perceive as always having enjoyed the garlanded nature of high office more than the slog and scrutiny of day-to-day politics. “He doesn’t like the chicken dinners in Manorhamilton on a Friday night at 10pm, and that’s what politics is,” said one Coalition source. The presidency of the European Council has been mentioned – but against his track record, there is also the stark political fact that by April 6th, he will be a Government backbencher. “If he wanted a big international job his political capital for gaining such a position has evaporated with his resignation,” says one veteran observer. Another option is the private sector, where Varadkar would have his pick of a wide variety of roles, with some speculation that he could land in a globe-trotting, major league public affairs job like that held by former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg with Meta. Certainly he is well got in those boardrooms. Well down the pecking order in terms of options, in the eyes of several sources on Wednesday, was a return to medicine or a life on the backbenches – the latter he didn’t rule out. Varadkar once famously said he would be done with politics by 50. It seems he may have cleared that with five years to spare – but what comes next will doubtlessly be closely watched. As for now, all he would say to reporters was: “I have no CVs printed”.",0,1
2024/3/21,"Leo Varadkar’s standing tarnished by ‘Leo the leak’ affair  Varadkar said he sent a friend a contract because he wanted to reach an agreement with the National Association of General Practitioners that would be similar to a Irish Medical Organisation deal Leo Varadkar survived a storm over his leak of a confidential Government document to one of his doctor friends. But the affair tarnished his reputation and had potential to block his return for another term as taoiseach after Micheál Martin. Varadkar was branded “Leo the leak” for posting a draft State contract with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) to the home of his friend Dr Maitiú Ó Tuathail, then leader of the National Association of General Practitioners (NAGP), a rival to the IMO that is now defunct. The leak was in 2019 when he was in his first term as taoiseach. But he was still confronting the fallout in 2023, three years after Village magazine set the controversy in motion. The magazine’s report showed how Ó Tuathail said “Leo always delivers” when sending NAGP colleagues a picture of the leaked document. Varadkar claimed he sent Ó Tuathail the contract because he wanted to reach an agreement with the NAGP that would be similar to the IMO deal. But the document in question was not available to then health minister Simon Harris even though he was insisting on being given an opportunity to review it ahead of a Dáil debate. What is more, health officials had warned any leak would endanger the agreement. For its part the IMO had said any premature disclosure would “represent a serious breach of trust” when it was seeking the support of members for the deal. All of that called into question the basis of Varadkar’s defence when he apologised to the Dáil for the “inappropriate” leak, still insisting the “agreement was not something that was an official secret, highly confidential or commercially sensitive” at the time. Varadkar faced a lengthy Garda investigation, although the Director of Public Prosecution decided not to bring criminal charges. The DPP decision was pivotal – any criminal charge would have ended Varadkar’s political career. However, the Ó Tuathail leak was examined under ethics law by the Standards in Public Office (Sipo) commission. One complaint to the public ethics watchdog said the NAGP disclosure “speaks to a culture of insiders helping insiders, with confidential information provided to an individual as a result of his friendship with, and political support for, Mr Varadkar”. The Sipo commission ultimately dismissed demands for a formal inquiry but not before two of the State’s most senior independent officials dissented from its decision. In private statements to Sipo, Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) Seamus McCarthy and Ombudsman Ger Deering questioned Varadkar’s defence. McCarthy made a note saying some of Varadkar’s assertions “represent low grade evidence at best”, and warned of the risk of “credibility” issues emerging for Sipo by rejecting a complaint. Deering said Varadkar’s claims that the leaked document was no longer confidential were not supported by his own statements or public records. Still, the C&AG and Ombudsman were outvoted by three other Sipo commissioners when they ruled against an inquiry. Although Varadkar overcame an onslaught of criticism over the debacle it still raised serious questions about his judgment.",0,1
2024/3/21,"Leo Varadkar was subjected to sustained abuse in the UK during Brexit negotiations Varadkar’s inability to develop a relationship with British prime minister Theresa May marked a low point Leo Varadkar, even to his closest friends, is not a natural diplomat, though few Irish politicians ever took as much sustained abuse in the UK as he did during the Brexit negotiations. Sometimes it bordered on racist. “Why isn’t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?” the then British prime minister Boris Johnson said jocosely to one of his Downing Street team during the height of the negotiations. Anglo-Irish relations by then were poisoned by London’s attempts to get out of the European Union on its terms alone. Finding it incomprehensible that its wishes were being thwarted, it proved impossible for some Conservatives, such as lead negotiator David Frost, that Ireland was acting in its own interests, that it had agency and that it was not simply acting as the mouthpiece for dark forces in Brussels, as they were seen by some in the UK. Varadkar, his Fine Gael colleague Simon Coveney, and Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin were the face of that position on British television screens, where clean, crisp messaging on the Irish side favourably contrasted with the confused pronouncements of various Conservative ministers. Varadkar’s best day came in Thornton Manor Hotel on the Wirral outside Liverpool in October 2019 when he met Johnson, who was by then desperate for a deal since he had realised that the House of Commons would never accept a no-deal Brexit. In 90 minutes of talks on their own at the wedding venue the two laid the basis for the deal that formed the basis of the later agreement that cleared the way for the UK’s departure from the EU, but kept Northern Ireland inside the EU single market. An agreement that day had not been expected. The outcome surprised Brussels’ officials, who were initially sceptical, but little in it was subsequently altered when EU negotiator Michel Barnier teased out the details. Varadkar had a clear understanding of how much Brussels would accept and he was prepared to act. The subsequent difficulties could not be laid at his door after Johnson made clear that he had no intention of honouring his word. If the Wirral was a good day Varadkar’s inability to develop a relationship with Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, marked a lower point, where the socially-awkward Varadkar met the even more socially-awkward Conservative. “Enda Kenny would have made it his business to build a relationship with her, no matter what it took, or how hard he had to work at it. Leo just isn’t made that way, he couldn’t,” said one individual who observed their interactions. Would better relations have mattered in the end? Perhaps not, since May was unable to sell the deal she reached with the European Union in 2018 that included the now-famous “backstop”, but which her backbenchers would never accept. More negatively Varadkar became a lightning rod for unionists, “the venomous interloper in Northern Ireland’s internal affairs is resigning! No loss!” cried the leader of Traditional Unionist Voice party Jim Allister on Wednesday. However, he got up the noses of more equable unionists than Allister too, especially with his frequent remarks about Irish unity. He was entitled to voice his views, say many, but why rile people for no immediate return, say others. For some it was generational. “Micheál Martin is closer in age to some of these people. He understands the way you have to talk to people if you’re sitting down with the Orange Order,” said one observer. “Leo never did; never wanted to either.”",0,1
2024/3/21,"TD calls for end to Army security provision for paramilitary prisoners Soldiers provide 24-hour security at State’s highest security prison in Portlaoise, which cost approximately €1.9m in 2023 A call has been made for the Government to immediately end the use of soldiers for security at Portlaoise prison and to stop “wasting €1.9 million on a small number of prisoners who could easily be held securely under the normal prison regime”. Fianna Fáil TD Éamon Ó Cúiv said circumstances had changed “dramatically” since the Army was first used more than 50 years ago to provide security at the prison for republican paramilitaries. Tánaiste Micheál Martin told him that the ending of security by the Defence Forces as an aid to the civil power “is the direction of travel”. Soldiers continue to provide 24-hour security at Ireland’s highest security prison, at a cost last year of approximately €1.9 million. Mr Martin said this “includes the costs of escorting prisoners to medical appointments and court hearings outside the prison”. But the numbers of soldiers involved had dropped since the plan was first mooted almost two years ago because of the dwindling number of paramilitary prisoners. The prison’s E Wing, which is used to house republican paramilitaries, had just 13 out of 75 beds occupied in July 2022. During Defence question time in the Dáil Mr Martin, who is Minister for Defence said the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces recommended “standing down” a number of projects the Defence Forces were involved in “which no longer seem justified in the current security situation”. He said there had been consultations with the Department of Justice and “a reduced level of deployment is now in place commensurate with the assessed threat levels”. Traditionally some 100 Army personnel were involved in the prison but that is now down to 16 soldiers, and will be reduced further on a phased basis, he added. Mr Ó Cuív said that when he met the Tánaiste about the issue in December 2020 “there were 29 prisoners in the E block in Portlaoise. At this moment there are fewer than 10. By mid-summer it could be half that again.” Mr Ó Cuív said this was a “radically different situation than the situation that caused the Army to be deployed there in the first place”. He believed there were no prisoners awaiting trial and some prisoners were nearing the end of their sentences, with one due for release next month. “We are talking about a small number of people,” he said. “There are all sorts of other prisoners in the prisons who are high risk. It seems amazing that this small number of prisoners needs the Army to secure them when nobody else in the whole prison system, who are in for very significant crimes, needs this.” The Galway West TD who has long campaigned on prison conditions and prisoners’ rights welcomed ongoing reviews of the situation but he believed it was time to deal with the situation and to stop “wasting €1.9 million on a small number of prisoners who could easily be held securely under the normal prison regime”.  The Tánaiste told him it was the ultimate intention to have the prison authorities deal with security and that the aid to civil power requirement would no longer exist. “That would be the fervent hope of all of us in that regard, and that is the direction of travel.”",0,1
2024/3/22,"Leo Varadkar says there is no ‘scandal’ that prompted decision to quit as Taoiseach Outgoing Taoiseach says he is ‘not interested in any form of ministerial office’ Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will not serve in Cabinet under a new taoiseach, he said this morning in Brussels as he attends his last European Council meeting. Asked if he would serve in a new Cabinet if asked by the new taoiseach, Mr Varadkar was emphatic: “No, no, no,” he said, “not interested in any form of ministerial office, so if asked I will refuse, if nominated I will decline – but no, definitely not”. He repeated, however, that he had not made up his mind whether he would run in the next general election. Asked if he would recall the Dáil early to elect a new taoiseach if as expected Simon Harris is only one nominee for the Fine Gael leadership next Monday, Mr Varadkar said he had “no plans to do that unless the three party leaders ask me to. If they ask me – happy to but no plans to do that. “And I’m conscious that it is the Easter break and TDs, Senators, Dáil staff will have made arrangements, so if the three leaders ask me, no difficulty personally.” Mr Varadkar was also asked if there was any reason that had not yet emerged for his shock announcement this week. “I think the question you’re asking me is – is there some kind of scandal that’s about to break that I’m aware of. There isn’t is the straight answer to that. I understand the need for conspiracy theories, and speculation, but that’s simply not the case,” he told reporters. “That’s not to say that somebody isn’t going to throw some allegation at me tomorrow, next week or in a few months’ time that I’m not aware of now that will be a load of rubbish like most of them are and people will then turn around and say: ‘Aha! That’s the real reason’, but that’s not the – like, if you want to do that, fine.” He declined to say anything about the Fine Gael leadership until nominations next Monday, except to say that whoever becomes leader will have full support. Mr Varadkar welcomed the decision of EU leaders last night to agree on a call for a humanitarian pause followed by a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza. He said it was a “very significant step I think in the right direction ... to see at long last the European Union has a position that is calling for a ceasefire”. “Of course,” he said, “the European Union calling for a ceasefire and now it would seem the US is doing the same thing now doesn’t make it happen. What’s necessary is that the parties to the conflict agree to a ceasefire ... and we need to put as much pressure on them as possible to make that happen.” On Friday, in a statement, Mr Varadkar and the prime ministers of Malta, Slovenia and Spain said they met in the margins of the European Council to share views on the situation in Gaza and the Middle East. They welcomed the “conclusions adopted by the European Council” yesterday and said they were “agreed on the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of hostages and a rapid, massive and sustained increase of humanitarian aid into Gaza”. “We are agreed that the only way to achieve lasting peace and stability in the region is through implementation of a two-state solution, with Israeli and Palestinian States living side-by-side, in peace and security,” they added. “We discussed together our readiness to recognise Palestine and said that we would do so when it can make a positive contribution and the circumstances are right,” said Mr Varadkar; Robert Abela, prime minister of Malta; Robert Golob, prime minister of Slovenia; and Pedro Sánchez, prime minister of Spain.",0,1
2024/3/22,"Labour’s ‘red lines’ revealed but conference is ‘not great timing’  Ivana Bacik to outline demands for entering government as she calls for election in wake of shock Leo Varadkar resignation Labour Party “red lines” for entering a future government are set to form a key part of Ivana Bacik’s address to delegates gathered in Dublin for its National Conference on Saturday. The Labour leader is expected to outline the following conditions for her party entering a coalition after the next election: full separation of church and State; a new community model of policing; leave entitlements for women who suffer miscarriages; a stronger State role in making renewable energy available; and increased housing targets. When Leo Varadkar announced on Wednesday he would depart as Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach, Ms Bacik was quick to demand a general election, saying it is “utterly untenable” that the Government would stay in office. Regardless of the fighting words, Labour Party figures must have been ruing their bad luck in having their conference take place just days after Varadkar’s shock announcement became the biggest political news story in years. As a smaller party, which has not yet recovered from the electoral battering it took in 2016 after a stint in government with Fine Gael, Labour could have done without the media being distracted for its big weekend. “It’s not great timing,” admits Dublin Fingal TD Duncan Smith. He remains positive, saying that much of the work of such conferences involves engaging with members and developing policies. “Obviously we would love as much focus from the outside on our conference and our leader’s speech as possible. Hopefully we will get that.” Labour has seven TDs. Its support level stood at 4 per cent in the most recent Irish Times/Ipsos B&A poll in February. Smith says during the time he has been seeking election “we’ve never been higher than 6 per cent and we’ve still managed to return seats in areas where we’ve had good candidates and we’re working hard”. Bacik may be planning to set out “red lines” but does the party have an appetite for going back into government? “One thing that differentiates us from others on the left is that we are ready to step up and go into government and we are, with this parliamentary party, a refreshed group,” says Smith. “I think if we present a clear message to the electorate that resonates and we can add to our numbers then absolutely we’ll be ready to go into negotiations to enter government.” He says of this week’s big news that Fine Gael “seem to be unravelling”, adding: “if they do need a reset they shouldn’t be using 10-11 months of Government for that. “They should be going to the people and putting their case across as we will be.” Senator Marie Sherlock – who plans to run for the Dáil in Dublin Central – says: “We’ve been on election footing for some time now. We’re ready”. “We’re going to see a new taoiseach installed effectively without a mandate and there’s a very clear desire for change out there so we believe an election should be called.” Sherlock says there is an opportunity for Labour to “to drive home our message all the more ... that the public want a decent health system, a decent education system. A country that has incredible public finances should at a very minimum have decent services.” She mentions the need for affordable housing, workers’ rights and improving childcare and eldercare as some of the themes that will be aired at the conference. The party will debate almost 90 motions across the weekend. They include proposals for improving housing supply, including measures designed to get more people living in city centres, and climate action ideas such as establishing a State retrofitting company to accelerate energy-efficiency improvements for social housing. There is a call for the introduction of a €9 monthly “climate transport ticket” to help shift people away from using cars as Ireland seeks to meet climate targets. There is also a proposal for the Labour Party to draft a bill designating abuse and threats against retail, healthcare and all public-facing staff as a specific public order criminal offence. On the war in Gaza, a wide-ranging motion includes a call on the Government to signal public support for the genocide case being taken by South Africa against Israel in the International Court of Justice.

2024/3/22,"Simon Harris set to become new FG leader on Sunday as closing date for nominations brought forward Minister for Higher Education says timing of a general election not a priority  Simon Harris is set to become the new Fine Gael leader on Sunday after the closing date for nominations to contest the election was brought forward. The Minister for Higher Education is so far the only person to put their name forward to replace outgoing leader and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. If only one person is nominated by 1pm on Sunday, the Fine Gael executive council will confirm that person as Party Leader and they will address a meeting of the council. Speaking earlier on Friday, Mr Harris said he is committed to fulfilling his party’s commitments to the Programme for Government when he becomes taoiseach. When asked if there will be a general election later this year, he said he was not ruling anything in or out for now but the timing of an election was not a priority. The Wicklow TD and Minister for Higher Education spoke to media in advance of a Fine Gael event in the City North Hotel in Gormanston, Co Meath on Friday morning. “If given the opportunity to serve I remain fully committed to implementing the Programme for Government and to working with colleagues in Fianna Fáil and the Green Party to deliver for the people of this country,” he said. In relation to an early election he said: “I’m certainly not getting into it right now but my priority at the moment isn’t about elections.” Asked about his plans to reshuffle Fine Gael ministers, Mr Harris indicated it was too early to consider any changes saying he would wait until the process to elect a new leader had been completed. “We have a very talented parliamentary party. I’m really looking forward to having the opportunity to showcase those talents in the coming days and weeks. That’s for another day.” Earlier the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe declined to say whether he had considered standing for the leadership himself, saying only that he was “very lucky to have two roles [Minister for Public Expenditure and President of the Eurogroup] that I cherish and mean a lot to me, that I do my very best in as a public servant and that’s where my energy and focus are”. He said he had not canvassed support for a leadership bid. Asked if he was keen to continue in Cabinet, he said: “Yes I am but that is a matter for the new Taoiseach . . . Of course I’m eager to continue with my work.” Asked if it was necessary for him to stay in Cabinet to keep his role as head of the Eurogroup, the group of finance ministers whose countries use the signle currency – as is widely assumed in Brussels – Mr Donohoe said he hadn’t “thought that far ahead”. He added however that it has been the practice for the head of the Eurogroup to be a finance minister. “But it’s up to the new Taoiseach to decide who will be in the new Cabinet,” he said.",0,1
2024/3/23,"Labour conference told ‘TikTok taoiseach’ Simon Harris lacks vision Labour party working extra hard to motivate members in advance of the local and European elections Incoming Fine Gael leader and taoiseach Simon Harris has been described as a “yappy dog chasing a tyre” without the vision needed for government. Labour’s Ged Nash hit out at the soon to be appointed leader as he spoke to reporters at his party’s two-day national conference. “I think Simon Harris will be a little bit like the yappy dog who’s chasing the car. If he caught the car, he won’t know what to do with it. I don’t believe that Mr Harris will have the kind of vision that you need to transform the way government is done at the top. We’ve seen no evidence of this in terms of how he has operated as minister over the last few years.” The party’s finance spokesman said “this government seems to think that the only metric of success that matters is economic success. But the Labour Party is very clear that you cannot eat good GDP figures.” Criticising the social media savvy Mr Harris he said “we don’t believe the TikTok taoiseach will transform anything, he will merely tinker around the edges”. He was speaking as the party debated housing, transport and workers’ rights issues. Party leader Ivana Bacik told delegates that “what we have now is a coalition that increasingly does not even believe in itself, with increasing numbers of resignations. When they say a week is a long time in politics, this week, it was never truer than this week. “We see a failing Coalition, a coasting Government, clinging to office even while it jettisons members, terrified of change. And that’s not the politics we so desperately need now, whether that’s in the council chamber in Government buildings or in the European parliament. “Those politics isolate us. When the far-right burn buildings or cities, those politics look the other way.” She added that “we have a once in a lifetime opportunity with the elections that we’re facing into over the year ahead to create a liveable planet a thriving community, homes for all.” She claimed the Government was “tinkering” with issues and “not for transformation, and that’s wrong”. In Labour, we say what we mean and we mean what we say. We’re not beholden to beholden to vested interests. We do not ditch our core principles for populism. And we’re not under any other party’s thumb. She again paid tribute to late former minister of state Emmet Stagg who as housing minister “was steadfast in his commitment to deliver public housing on public land”. When Mr Nash was questioned about Labour’s capacity to compete with Mr Harris’s social media capacity to connect with young people Mr Nash said the there were really “impressive younger members who are responding to Labour’s message” adding that people are tired of Fine Gael who had been in office for 13 years and since 2016 had not managed to turn Ireland’s economic success into the kind of social progress we’ve seen across the EU” and Mr Harris had to take his fair share of responsibility for that. He insisted that Labour was at much more than the 3 per cent to 5 per cent various polls put them at and would be “extremely competitive” in 15 to 17 constituencies in the general election. He said they have a strong team of 55 councillors and hopeful of at least one European parliament seat. And on competition with the Social Democrats perceived to be occupying the same left-wing ground, he said most sitting TDs in both parties were not running in the same constituencies and in many ways the two parties “complement” each other. He believed the “shine” was coming off Sinn Féin who had a broad coalition of different interests and there was “confusion” in the party on a number of issues including immigration and decriminalisation of drugs. Labour will be working extra hard this weekend to motivate members in advance of the local and European elections on June 7th and a general election within a year. Labour has selected close to the 110 candidates it hopes to field in the local elections, the same number as last time around in 2019, and hoping to increase the number of local authority members from 55 currently. And the party is confident that it has the organisational capacity across the country that other left leaning parties such as the Social Democrats do not have. Dublin Bay North TD Aodhán Ó Riordáin is the party’s Dublin European election candidate, whose campaign was officially launched on Friday evening. Limerick sociologist Niamh Hourigan has been selected for Ireland South with its candidate for Midlands-North West yet to be confirmed. The party currently has no MEPs. Almost 90 motions are proposed for across the weekend. They include proposals for improving housing supply, including measures designed to get more people living in city centres, and climate action ideas such as establishing a State retrofitting company to accelerate energy-efficiency improvements for social housing. There is a call for the introduction of a €9 monthly “climate transport ticket” to help shift people away from using cars as Ireland seeks to meet climate targets.

On the war in Gaza, a wide-ranging motion includes a call on the Government to signal public support for the genocide case being taken by South Africa against Israel in the International Court of Justice. On the eve of the conference party leader Ivana Bacik renewed her call for a general election. “We need to see a radical change in Government. We want a general election now, we’re very clear about that. We’ve seen more disarray in Government today, we don’t see this as the time for a changing of the guard in Fine Gael.” Mr Varadkar’s decision to resign “certainly amounts to a vote of no confidence in his own Government, and we are very sure that now is the time for the people of Ireland not members of Fine Gael to decide who leads the country for the challenges out there”.",0,1
2024/3/23,"Leo Varadkar deserved more in the way of tributes, says former taoiseach Bertie Ahern Mr Ahern said that the Government is ‘goosed’ if Simon Harris pushes Fine Gael’s agenda too much Former taoiseach Bertie Ahern has said that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar deserves huge credit for the manner in which he navigated Brexit and stayed loyal to the Belfast Agreement. In an interview with Brendan O’Connor on RTÉ Radio 1, Mr Ahern said that he would have liked to have heard more in the way of tributes to the Taoiseach following his decision to resign. “He (Varadkar) did a good job. He did good service. I had a lot of dealings with him on Northern Ireland. He fought through the whole campaign – the backstop, the Protocol, the Windsor Agreement .. he stayed loyal to the Good Friday Agreement. He took a lot of pressure on that. And I think he did a very good job on it. “I would have liked to hear more of them (tributes). Particularly on the one (issue) I have a passionate interest in, which is Northern Ireland. He (Varadkar) gave a huge amount of time to making sure we didn’t have a land border. You remember all the battles with the Tories. “All the difficulties he had. He got Boris (Johnson) on side. He also went offside nearly as quick which wasn’t Leo’s fault. We got the institution back up and running. “He (Varadkar) deserves a lot of credit for the time and commitment he put in to that and I am not sure he was getting that during the week.” Mr Ahern also praised Mr Varadkar for his handling of the early stages of the Covid crisis and for his contribution to international issues such as Gaza. The former Fianna Fáil leader said he had presumed that Mr Varadkar would fight the next election “stay around a little while and then go.” “From his point of view he (Varadkar) has given it 15 years. Most of that time he has been in office. He obviously felt he wasn’t the right person for it. It requires a lot of energy. He obviously felt that wasn’t for him.” Mr Ahern admitted to being surprised at how quickly the leadership issue was finalised in favour of Simon Harris. “It was incredible. It was so quick. There seemed to be four or five candidates that I thought all had a lot of credibility. I did not think they would all fall out so quick and effectively by the time ‘Morning Ireland’ ended the following morning the game was over. “People look at the job now and if you haven’t got it in your gut to give it 365 days a year and 18 hours a day ... I am not too sure that many people want to do that. I had the honour and pleasure of doing it but I think people who have been in the Cabinet, and they see what is involved and they see the commitment and they probably see the abuse too, I think a lot of them just didn’t want it.” Meanwhile, Mr Ahern said that Minister Harris has “all the attributes” required to be the next taoiseach. “He (Harris) had all his ducks lined up in a row very quickly. His plan was exactly what Leo did on Simon Coveney a number of years ago. He (Harris) had everything lined up. “Communication is a big (attribute of the job) and he (Harris) is good at that. He also has that attention to the detail and I think you really need that. He doesn’t have the international experience or the experience on the north but Micheál Martin is still there so for the next year at least he doesn’t have to worry about that. “If I was him I wouldn’t take this as a sprint. He is going to be around for ten years. He has time to build it up. “I don’t go with this thing that he has to turn the fortune of Fine Gael around in June in the local elections. I think that is an unreasonable thing to ask him to do.” Mr Ahern said that Mr Harris needs to work very closely with Fianna Fáil’s Micheál Martin and the Green Party’s Eamon Ryan. “If he was to go pushing too much of the Fine Gael line against Micheál Martin, this Government is over. He is going to have with work very closely (with both). He has to continue what Leo was doing. It is that unity of Government. If you don’t do that the Government is goosed. He has all the attributes, but he just has to be careful. Sometimes it can be the small things that can trip you up.” He added that it is his expectation that this Government would go full term, and that the General Election will be pushed out to next year.",0,1

Mr Markey’s decision to withdraw from the Fine Gael selection convention for the constituency comes amid a significant period of change in the party with several sitting politicians announcing they will not contest upcoming elections. In a statement released on Saturday, Mr Markey, a farmer from Co Louth, thanked party members for their support and said he was proud of the work he has done since taking on the role. “I believe the most viable path to winning two seats for Fine Gael in the election in June is with two candidates, and I wish the remaining candidates all the best during their campaigns,” Mr Markey said, adding that he would remain in politics and plans to contest future elections. Mr Markey, who replaced Mairead McGuinness as MEP in 2020 following her appointment as EU Commissioner, previously said he would be seeking re-election this year.

2024/3/23,"Housing crisis is civil rights issue of this generation, Labour leader Ivana Bacik tells party conference Bacik says Labour would transform Land Development Agency into State construction company to build homes The housing crisis is the civil rights issue of this generation, Labour leader Ivana Bacik has told her party’s annual conference as she pledged that a government with Labour in it would transform the Land Development Agency into a State construction company to build homes. She said her party would protect renters by reinstating a ban on no fault evictions, provide dedicated housing for older people and people with disabilities and introduce a new fair deal scheme to support older people to remain living at home. “And we commit to recognise the true value of care work through decent pay and conditions for carers.” Stressing that building homes would be the party’s number one priority in government she reiterated Labour’s pledge of one million homes over a decade with 50,000 new builds and 50,000 retrofits a year. In her leader’s address to some 600 delegates at the Helix in DCU, Ms Bacik insisted that “we will never solve the supply and affordability crisis with subsidies to developers. It’s time for stronger State action”. She said to applause that “people want radical change, not cosmetic change”. On health she pledged to “complete the roll-out of free GP care that we started, lift the HSE recruitment embargo, and reverse the privatisation of healthcare”. Labour would legislate for assisted dying, would implement its policy of community model of policing with more gardaí on the streets. Her party would provide a “truly free” education system with separation of Church and State and school places for all children. In planning for a united Ireland, a Labour government would have a “dedicated Department to undertake the necessary detailed work of reconciliation, integration, and unity planning”. It would introduce a new bill of disability rights and would “ensure social protection payments are automatically increased in line with inflation”. Labour would “end Direct Provision and deliver a fair and effective policy on migration” in contrast to the Government whose treatment of refugees left them “out in the cold, while vacant buildings lie empty”. In a speech laced with references to the need for more State involvement, she claimed “the Government has made a pyramid scheme of our basic needs. They are giving people a trickle of their taxes back to pay for non-existent services they should have provided in the first place.” The problem, she said is “we have government parties which do not believe in the power of the State; Ministers who are out of touch, have lost control, or have left their jobs. “Focused on internal leadership contests, they want to do anything but govern.” In a conference overshadowed by the Fine Gael leadership change the party’s seven TDs aimed to enthuse their members to campaign for the local and European elections, in a bid to increase their councillor numbers from 56 and win at least one European Parliament seat. Ms Bacik said too many young people were still living with their parents, “stuck in a rental trap, paying off someone else’s mortgage” or delaying having children. This was the reality of modern Ireland with “no security, no certainty – a new precariat.” The Dublin Bay South TD highlighted Ireland’s sense of solidarity and “strong voice in condemning Israel’s genocide in Gaza,” as she renewed her call for the State “to break diplomatic and trade links with Israel”. She also renewed her party’s opposition to the reappointment of Ursula von der Leyen as EU Commission president, claiming she “tacitly endorses the apartheid policies of Netanyahu’s government”. And in a swipe at Sinn Féin she said the party’s group in the EU parliament is voting “against nature restoration laws and tacitly endorse Putin’s brutal regime in Russia”. She pledged her party’s focus to cut electricity bills and save families up to €700 a year, through the State ramping up renewable energy and retrofitting grants so people could afford to upgrade their homes. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s resignation “is the ultimate vote of no confidence in his own Government”. She wished Simon Harris well but challenged the “new temporary taoiseach” and said that “if he has confidence in this Government he should call a general election now.

2024/3/24,"Maria Walsh and former jockey Nina Carberry nominated to run for Fine Gael in European elections Pair to run in Midlands-North West constituency as Welsh seeks second term in European Parliament Fine Gael MEP Maria Walsh and former jockey Nina Carberry have been formally nominated to run for the party in the forthcoming European elections. The two were nominated to run in the Midlands-North West constituency for the European Parliament at a convention in Athlone on Sunday. Ms Walsh told the convention she sought re-election as someone with a proven track record as a sitting MEP. She said she had campaigned day in and day out to put mental health on the European political agenda. She said she was confident that there would soon be a first ever EU-wide mental health strategy which would seek to end the horrific loss of life from suicide. Ms Walsh said she had also put focus on protecting Ireland’s tax regime and had voted against all EU legislation “that threatens our competitive advantage”. Ms Carberry said the ups downs of politics did not faze her. She said in 2005 as a 20-year-old jockey with her first ride at the Cheltenham Festival she became the first woman to win in 18 years. She said the next day she was unseated on the favourite at the start. “That was the beginning of a lifelong lesson in perseverance.” She said, if elected, she would like to see the voice of all the farmers in the region heard in Europe. Ms Carberry also said she would like to provide more educational opportunities for young people through the development of a cross-European apprenticeship scheme. At the weekend, another sitting Fine Gael MEP Colm Markey announced he would not be contesting this year’s European elections. “I have informed Fine Gael that I will be withdrawing my name from the MEP selection convention for Midlands-North West constituency,” he said. “My focus will return to my home county of Louth and in particular Drogheda which has faced particular challenges in recent months and years.” Speaking on Sunday, Fine Gael director of elections Simon Coveney said Mr Markey had a future in the party and suggested that he might run for the Dáil in the Louth constituency. “I have spent a lot of time with Colm over the last number of weeks. We have talked through how we can give the party the best possible shot of winning two seats out of five in this huge constituency,” he said.  “Colm has been remarkably helpful through that process. His only objective was to try to make sure that whatever final decisions we made collectively this week would maximise our chances of winning two seats.” “We have two really, really fantastic candidates here that I think can do that. And Colm felt it in the best interests of the party, that if he stood back, and in particular allowed Nina to really gain momentum along the east coast in this big constituency to try to counterbalance what, what Maria is already achieving on the West coast, that that we would give this party a real fighting chance of winning two seats.”",0,1
2024/3/25,"Simon Harris rules out early election after taking over as Fine Gael leader ‘I would like to see this Government going full term,’ says presumptive taoiseach, ‘that is my intention’ New Fine Gael leader and presumptive taoiseach Simon Harris has signalled no snap general election and that the Government will run its full term until early next year. Speaking following the formal announcement of his unopposed election at a party convention in Athlone, Mr Harris said he would meet Fine Gael Ministers in the Cabinet to set priorities for what can be delivered in their areas in the lifetime of the Government. In a speech to party activists and members following his election on Sunday, Mr Harris said that under his leadership, Fine Gael would stand for supporting businesses, especially small businesses and for making work pay. He also said the party “stands for law and order, on the side of An Garda Síochána, where our streets are safe and crime is never allowed go unchecked”. He also said that he would seek “to move from an emergency response to the migration crisis to a more planned, sustainable model, to a fair and firm system when it comes to migration” Speaking later to reporters he said people in Ireland were compassionate but also wanted to know that the immigration system worked. “We need to move beyond the emergency response to telling Irish people, what’s the plan for migration and accommodation policy,” he said. People who came to Ireland to seek asylum should “get a yes/no answer quicker”, he said. “People who have a right to stay should be welcomed, should be integrated. People who don’t have a right to stay should be asked to leave.” Mr Harris’s move to scotch speculation of a general election this year by insisting that the Government will run its full term to the spring of 2025 will please his Coalition partners in Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, who were against the rumoured preference of Leo Varadkar for an election later this year. “I would like to see this Government going full term,” said Mr Harris. “That is my intention”. He also said that he had spoken to the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan by phone earlier and looked forward to meeting them in the coming days. He said he wanted to establish a relationship of trust with the two men. “Trust and mutual respect is key for this Government,” he said. Mr Harris also dismissed suggestions that the Dáil — which is in recess for two weeks for the Easter holidays — should be recalled earlier to facilitate his election as Taoiseach. He will attend the Fine Gael ardfheis the weekend after Easter and the Dáil will meet the following Tuesday, April 9th, when he is expected to be elected Taoiseach. Mr Harris will also have to pick his ministerial team before the Dáil reconvenes, already a subject of intense speculation in political circles. Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney said on Sunday he would be contesting the next general election, reducing the chances of a demotion for him. Mr Harris said that he would outline in more detail policy priorities when he delivers his keynote ardfheis address, but speculation is already mounting that the legislation on hate speech and hate crime, stalled in the Seanad, could be amended significantly. One of the party’s senior backbenchers, Michael Ring, said on Sunday that the legislation should be scrapped and the party should return to its “core values”.",0,1
2024/3/25,"Abuse of politicians could lead to ‘wrong type of people’ seeking office, says Donohoe Minister fears ‘deeper trouble and dark days’ if narrative on abuse diminishes people’s interest in becoming politicians Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has warned the “wrong type of people” could enter politics if the abuse of politicians continues. Mr Donohoe admitted he receives a “large amount” of abuse, the majority of which is online. “Most of it is on social media. Occasionally, and only very occasionally, it’s to my face,” he said. He was speaking as a guest at a live recording of British political podcast For the Many at the Laughter Lounge in Dublin on Sunday night. “The moment we begin to talk about politics in such a way that diminishes the interest in becoming politicians, we have even deeper trouble ahead and dark days. “If the narrative becomes completely focused on the abuse by a minority, they’ll win and they’ll really win when the number of people who want to become politicians begins to dwindle or even worse, the wrong kind of people want to become politicians,” he said. Mr Donohoe stressed the majority of people across the country are respectful of the work that politicians do. He said there are also broader questions concerning the media’s role in the tone surrounding politics and politicians that are “worthy of debate.” “I have a lot of respect for journalists who do their work and interrogate me and hold me to account, but I do think we need to take a step back and just think about the tone around politics and the role that others play in it as opposed to just politicians,” he said. “Irish people have a very high level of interest in politics and current affairs, and there is definitely an aptitude for a more discursive, little less confrontational tone regarding how we talk about politics,” he said. Mr Donohoe, who reiterated his intention to run in the next general election, said the abuse faced by politicians was not a factor in the uncontested leadership bid for Fine Gael. Although it was something he “tested and interrogated” throughout the week, the Minister said he has never wanted to become taoiseach, adding he hopes the election of Simon Harris as leader will reverse the decline in public support for the party. Following Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s announcement that he would step down, Mr Donohoe said he could retrospectively see “some signs” adding he has seen the impact the position takes on the holder. “I knew a moment like this was going to come, but I did not see it coming on Wednesday morning,” he said. Having worked under three separate taoisigh, Mr Donohoe said he has seen the “toll” the position can take on someone. “For lots of different reasons, public life and political life is getting more and more demanding,” he said adding that the role of taoiseach is at the “apex” of it.",0,1
2024/3/25,"Core issues of referendums, housing and immigration to the fore among electorate Participants in snapshot poll unimpressed by how Coalition handled campaign on Family and Care referendums Grabbing the public’s attention, according to the latest Irish Times/Ipsos B&A Snapshot poll, are the Family and Care referendums and how these campaigns were managed by the Government. When participants in the snapshot poll were asked what they had seen or heard from Government recently that suggested the country is going in the right or wrong direction, 23 per cent cited or remarked on the Family and Care referendums. The sudden appearance of referendums in the latest poll has not reduced the potency of housing (mentioned by 16 per cent, up one point), highlighting how entrenched it is as an issue of public concern. Immigration remains topical (14 per cent of mentions), although somewhat overshadowed by the referendums this month (down eight points). Fieldwork for the latest snapshot poll was carried out between March 1st and March 13th, covering both pre- and post-referendum periods, and was completed before Leo Varadkar announced his resignation. Each snapshot poll is conducted among a random national sample of 1,000 Irish adults aged 15 years and upwards. Women were significantly more cognisant of the March 8th referendums (mentioned by 30 per cent) than men (mentioned by 16 per cent). Also highly engaged was the most progressive generation — the 15- to 24-year-olds — among whom 36 per cent of verbatims referenced the referendums. The referendum results themselves are evidence that the Government did not capitalise on the opportunity. Today’s snapshot findings provide some insight into where it went wrong. Comments made about the Government’s referendum performance were broadly unfavourable, with 81 per cent of verbatims on the topic classified as negative. While all age cohorts viewed the referendums unfavourably, the 35- to 54-year-old age group was particularly unimpressed, with 94 per cent of comments from this cohort categorised as negative. Both women (79 per cent negative) and men (85 per cent negative) gave the Government the thumbs down on how the referendums were handled. Referendum negativity overwhelmingly focused on a lack of information and understanding. Verbatim comments were peppered with references to complexity, confusion and a general lack of information. Some respondents were unhappy with the wording, with ambiguity leading them to question whether changing the Constitution would actually enhance the status and protections given to women and carers. The need to hold the referendums in the first instance was queried by some respondents, with reference made on occasion to the costs involved. Over time, the housing crisis has proven to be a thorn in the side of the Government, refusing to slip down the list of issues on which the Government is judged, no matter what else is going on. For housing it is business as usual in March, mentioned by 16 per cent of all respondents, increasing to 21 per cent among 25- to 34-year-olds. Immigration completes the triumvirate of meta-narratives shaping opinion, attracting 14 per cent of comments this month. Among the least affluent socio-economic grouping, immigration remains the lens through which the Government is most likely scrutinised, accounting for 24 per cent of comments. When Government opinion is under the gravitational pull of three core issues — referendums, housing and immigration — other concerns struggle to feature prominently. Less salient in March were issues such as Israel-Palestine, crime-gardaí and climate change-sustainability. Next month’s snapshot poll will no doubt tell a different story. The referendums will be old news, replaced perhaps by a leadership contest and the fallout from Varadkar’s resignation. A month is a very long time in politics.",0,1
2024/3/25,"Ireland’s neutrality no excuse for complacency on defence, says Harris Biden calls Leo Varadkar to ‘recognise his years of service as a leader of Ireland’ Ireland cannot and should not fear being part of discussions on defence, Fine Gael leader and taoiseach-in-waiting Simon Harris has said. In a speech on the future of Europe at the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin on Monday night he said Ireland would remain a neutral country but that did not excuse any complacency on defence and security issues. He said there were significant threats facing democracy in Europe and there were “powerful forces attempting to play on people’s fears, exploiting issues such as immigration for their own purposes”. Politicians should be “willing to debate and engage with citizens on issues of concern, and when it comes to migration we need to have systems that are both fair and firm”, he said. Greater resources needed to be provided to the Defence Forces, he added. He spoke of working in partnership with tech companies “to identify and neutralise foreign interference in democratic debates”. “We need to find ways to shatter the walls of misinformation that are encircling us.” Mr Harris said in the battle against misinformation, “education is our most potent weapon”. “We need to develop critical media literacy programmes to empower our citizens to discern truth from falsehood, neutralising the impact of disinformation campaigns. The enemies of democracy are ambitious, so we need to match their ambition.” The Fine Gael leader also said it was important “we protect the independence of our judiciary”, the integrity of electoral processes, and foster a vibrant civil society. “Our Defence Forces have played a vital role not only in defending our country – but in spreading peace to other parts of the world. As our country matures and grows we will need to resource them to deal with modern challenges our country’s founders could have never imagined. Protecting our borders in an age of increased maritime and haulage smuggling, the threat of terrorism which now extends worldwide and responding on a national level to incidents that affect the entire nation as we saw a few short years ago.” He said as powerful forces attempted to play on the fears of people and to exploit issues such as immigration, not enough had been done in the past to counter these issues. “Unfortunately, we have not always done enough to combat these fears. We have not always communicated with our citizens about what we are doing and why it is the right thing to do. We need to listen to people and try to answer their concerns and alleviate their fears. We need to be better at communicating and defending our values. We also need to be willing to debate and engage with citizens on issues of concern, and when it comes to migration, we need to have systems that are both fair and firm. “The enemies of democracy deploy misinformation to manipulate and confuse, all the time hiding their true intentions, which are to sow division and reap discord,” he added. Meanwhile, US president Joe Biden has called Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to “recognise his years of service as a leader of Ireland” and “the good relationship they have developed”, the White House said. The call came as Mr Varadkar prepares to step down as Taoiseach in two weeks’ time. Fine Gael leader Mr Harris is expected to be elected to the role by the Dáil on April 9th. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a briefing on Monday: “Having recently celebrated St Patrick’s Day at the White House, the leaders reflected on their co-operation over the years on shared priorities, particularly deepening US-Ireland ties between our people and our economies.” She said the pair “noted recent progress in Northern Ireland with the restoration of its Executive and Assembly reaffirming the critical role these institutions play in preserving the gains of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement”. Ms Jean-Pierre added: “The president conveyed that he looks forward to continuing to build a vibrant future for US-Irish relations with the new taoiseach once elected by the Irish parliament.” A spokesman for Mr Varadkar said the Taoiseach thanked Mr Biden for his good wishes and wished Mr Biden “the best of luck in November”. The Taoiseach also took the opportunity to brief the US President on the upcoming meeting of the North South Ministerial Council, which will take place on April 8th, which he said “will mark another important step forward in restoring the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement.” Mr Harris met Mr Varadkar on Monday amid preparations for the upcoming transition of power. Mr Harris was officially announced as Fine Gael leader at a party event in Athlone on Sunday. A spokesman for Mr Varadkar said on Monday: “Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met Fine Gael leader Simon Harris this morning for well over an hour. The Taoiseach briefed the Fine Gael leader on upcoming national and international issues.” Mr Harris is expected to meet the other Coalition leaders, Micheál Martin of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party’s Eamon Ryan, in the coming days. He said at the weekend he wanted to establish a relationship of trust with the two men.",0,1
2024/3/25,"Departing Fine Gael TD Brendan Griffin will not reconsider after Varadkar departure Charlie Flanagan also pushed back against speculation that he might return Kerry Fine Gael TD Brendan Griffin has not changed his mind about running for re-election, he said on Monday, speaking at a sod-turning ceremony at the Kerry Technology Park in Tralee. “I set out my stall on Thursday and nothing has changed since,” the TD said, referring to remarks on Radio Kerry that a change of leadership in Fine Gael would not mean a change of mind. New leader of Fine Gael Simon Harris had not asked him to return in the wake of Leo Varadkar’s surprise resignation, he also confirmed. “There’s been no offers made,” he said. He described speculation in the media about a possible decision to remain in politics as flattering, but he was happy with his decision. In a letter to party members and councillors in January 2023, Mr Griffin explained his decision not to seek re-election to the seat he has held since 2011. “The [reason] for this is a straightforward one. I have two young sons and I want to be around them more for the remaining years of their childhood,” he wrote. “Politics demands absolute commitment and is an extremely time and attention consuming profession.” Mr Griffin was critical of the social agenda of Fine Gael under Mr Varadkar’s stewardship. He endorsed Mr Harris on Thursday, with some conjecture that he could reconsider his decision to step away from politics. Mr Griffin was attending an event at a development by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas in Tralee, where it is building a €330m plant. It will be up and running in late 2027. Meanwhile, the attendance by Laois-Offaly TD Charlie Flanagan at the event in Athlone where Mr Harris was named as Fine Gael’s new leader prompted speculation that he might reconsider his decision not to contest the next general election. The gathering in Athlone was originally due to be a selection convention for the Midlands North-West European Parliament constituency but it was also used by Fine Gael to announce Mr Harris as party leader. Mr Flanagan told The Irish Times: “I wouldn’t read anything into my being in Athlone.” He added: “People are engaged in frenzied speculation since Leo Varadkar stepped down. “I was in Athlone yesterday supporting the MEP candidates because it was my duty as TD for the constituency of Laois-Offaly which is in the Midlands North-West constituency.”",0,1
2024/3/26,"Team Harris: who will be the Cabinet and political adviser loyalists around the new Fine Gael leader? Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney’s position central to options available to Fine Gael leader As the dust settles on the uncontested selection of Simon Harris as Fine Gael leader and presumptive taoiseach, political minds are turning to what is likely to be much more contested ground – the battle for seats at Cabinet and within Harris’s team of advisers in government buildings. In the first instance, the main question is how many spaces can be created around the Cabinet table: with one space to fill, the permutations arising from a second – or even third – space are Byzantine. Lateral moves between portfolios, elevations, demotions (not to mention sideways moves that could be deemed as moves up or down the food chain) are dominating discussions among the political class. Final decisions are not imminent, but the central role of Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Simon Coveney to matters is clear. The former tánaiste was said to be in ebullient form at the Fine Gael selection convention where Harris was elevated on Sunday, wholeheartedly committing to running again in the next general election. The reality is that while endless strategising is under way, the first task is assembling a kitchen cabinet of advisers for Harris, who is building up to the big job with a skeleton staff relative to the platoon of aides that will work in his office after April 9th. Joanne Lonergan, formerly Harris’s adviser in the Department of Health and a former assistant government press secretary, is being heavily linked with a return to Government Buildings. While specific roles have not been identified, it is expected that Lonergan would hold parity with Harris’s current adviser Sarah Bardon, the former Irish Times political journalist who joined him in 2018. Bardon and Lonergan would likely form the core of Harris’s adviser team, with the remaining faces and roles being built out from there. Max Murphy, Harris’s other adviser alongside Bardon, is likely to join him, while it is thought a heavyweight economics adviser is also being lined up. This would mark the return of a dedicated role filled in the Enda Kenny era by Andrew McDowell, who was not replaced when Leo Varadkar took over. The expectation is that someone with an established profile in academia, business or finance would come on board in a similar manner to that employed by Tánaiste Micheál Martin, who is advised on a part-time basis by Alan Ahearne, professor in economics at the University of Galway. This brief is being envisaged as a “fundamental part of the team”, according to one person involved in discussions. Stephen Kinsella, professor of economics at the University of Limerick, and John McHale, professor of economics at the University of Galway and a former chair of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, are names that have been discussed. Harris, who has served under three taoisigh, all of whom had different approaches to staffing their back-room operations, is thought to still be finalising the exact structure of his team – whether advisers are handed specific policy areas or whether they will share oversight of policy in different departments. The return of the economics advisory brief may not be matched with a similar position dedicated to Anglo-Irish or Northern Irish matters, as Varadkar had in his office with former Senator Jim D’Arcy. However, there is an expectation that some of Varadkar’s team may be asked to remain on, either in temporary roles or as permanent fixtures – with a desire for continuity, especially at this late stage in the electoral cycle. Clare Mungovan is seen as one such person, but some who had been fixtures of Varadkar’s tenure, such as Government press secretary Nick Miller, are seen as less likely to remain.",0,1
2024/3/26,"New measures to support struggling businesses could come before Budget - McGrath Simon Harris under pressure from party to emphasise supports for enterprise in coming months Minister for Finance Michael McGrath has indicated that measures could be introduced before the next Budget to assist businesses facing difficulty. Mr McGrath told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland that a report that Minister for Trade, Enterprise and Employment Simon Coveney brought forward, which examined the impact of the various policy measures that the Government had introduced to improve working conditions, had identified the necessity “in particular improving rates of pay, minimum wage and, improving certain leave entitlements and so on”. “There is a cost to business, arising from the combined effect of all of those measures,” Mr McGrath said. “And as a result of that, we have already indicated a number of moves that we are prepared to make.” The new Fine Gael leader and presumptive next Taoiseach Simon Harris signalled on Sunday that support for small businesses would be a key Fine Gael priority for his Government. In recent months, there has been much grumbling among Fine Gael backbenchers about increased costs for business, reflecting grassroots unease on the issue. “The energy efficiency grant for businesses is being increased. In relation to employer PRSI we have identified the consequence of the step effect that is there in respect of the low rate of employer PRSI, associated with low levels of income,” Mr McGrath, a Fianna Fáil minister, said. “And we are committed to examining what we can do in that space before the Budget. We discussed this a number of weeks ago at Cabinet committee level. And Minister Coveney brought forward a proposal to develop options paper to Cabinet recently. So that work is advancing through the Department of Social Protection. That is what I support. And that is a move that I would support, as soon as it has been completed. “And then we want to see the roll-out of the quarter of €1 billion grant to businesses over the coming weeks that we announced in the Budget.” When asked about the possibility of a transfer pact between himself, Tánaiste Micheál Martin and Simon Coveney in Cork South-Central, where all are running, Mr McGrath said there would be no transfer pact. He said, however, that he “very much respected” Mr Coveney’s approach to work and that they worked well together at constituency level, national level and around the Cabinet table. Mr McGrath also congratulated Simon Harris on his “impending elevation to the office of Taoiseach. It’s a very proud day for him and his family.” “We’ve worked closely with Simon around the Cabinet table for the last four years, and, I’ve been impressed with his work as a minister. Clearly, his colleagues in Fine Gael, fully support him, and he will be elected as Taoiseach of the country in two weeks time.” Mr McGrath said he knew that Mr Harris recognised the importance and value of a good relationship at leader level. “We have three parties in this Government. And while we will all seek to have our own individual identity as parties while continuing to serve in Government, the most important thing here is the stability of the Government that we offer certainty for our economy, for people who are creating and sustaining jobs in Ireland, and that we use the resources that we are generating wisely to build homes, to invest in public services. And that’s what the Government will do.”",0,1
2024/3/27,"Ireland to intervene in South Africa’s genocide case against Israel over Gaza invasion South Africa has accused Israel of breaching convention but International Court of Justice proceedings expected to last years Tánaiste Micheál Martin has confirmed that Ireland will intervene in the case initiated by South Africa against Israel under the Genocide Convention at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, and is calling for an end to its military operation there. Proceedings in the case are expected to last for years. Mr Martin has directed officials to commence work on a Declaration of Intervention under Article 63 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice and Cabinet was briefed on the plans on Wednesday. The Irish Times understands that the planned declaration will not allege that genocide is being committed. The motivation instead is to encourage the court to take an interpretation of the convention in a way that prioritises the protection of civilians. When completed the draft declaration must be approved by Government before it can be filed with the ICJ in The Hague. In January, the Government confirmed its intention to urgently consider filing a declaration of intervention in the case, based on a legal analysis of the Genocide Convention and consultation with partners, including South Africa. “That analysis and consultation has now concluded. Ireland will be intervening,” Mr Martin said in a statement on Wednesday. “It is for the court to determine whether genocide is being committed. But I want to be clear in reiterating what I have said many times in the last few months; what we saw on October 7th in Israel, and what we are seeing in Gaza now, represents the blatant violation of international humanitarian law on a mass scale. “The taking of hostages. The purposeful withholding of humanitarian assistance to civilians. The targeting of civilians and of civilian infrastructure. The indiscriminate use of explosive weapons in populated areas. The use of civilian objects for military purposes. The collective punishment of an entire population,” he said. “The list goes on. It has to stop. The view of the international community is clear. Enough is enough. The UN Security Council has demanded an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of hostages and the lifting of all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale. The European Council has echoed this call.” Mr Martin said intervention as a third party in a case before the International Court of Justice is a “complex matter and is relatively rare”, noting that since 1948, just four other interstate cases have been initiated under the Genocide Convention before the International Court of Justice. “Ireland intervened in one of these – Ukraine v Russia case – and, after a rigorous and comprehensive process of analysis and consultation over the last six weeks, we have determined that we will do so again in the South Africa v Israel case,” he said. Mr Martin said the situation in Palestine “could not be more stark”, adding that half the population of Gaza face imminent famine and 100 per cent of the population face acute food insecurity. “As the UN secretary general said as he inspected long lines of blocked relief trucks waiting to enter Gaza during his visit to Rafah at the weekend; ‘it is time to truly flood Gaza with life-saving aid. The choice is clear: surge or starvation’. I echo his words today,” he said. Once it receives Government approval, the declaration will be filed after South Africa has filed its memorial in the coming months. Mr Martin said Ireland will liaise with a number of partners who have also confirmed their intention to intervene.",0,1
2024/3/27,"Dart+, social housing and hospital beds to benefit from additional €2.25bn for National Development Plan Minister says some projects hit by construction cost inflation but denies announcement linked general election timing An additional €2.25 billion has been earmarked for projects in the National Development Plan (NDP) up to the end of 2026 as the Cabinet approved funding, in part, to help offset the impact of construction cost inflation. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe denied the allocation of the funding was linked to the timing of the next general election. The Government said the funding will facilitate the progression of important projects and enable more rapid development of key Coalition commitments like delivering on the Climate Action Plan and providing more housing and schools. Transport projects to be supported with the funds include Dart+, BusConnects and Cork commuter rail. There is to be additional investment in social and affordable housing programmes and more hospital beds. Updated capital spending ceilings for 2024 (€13 billion, up €250 million), 2025 (€14.35 billion, up €750 million) and 2026 (€15.45 billion, up €1.25 billion) were published. The increased funding comes after a Government review of the NDP, with Mr Donohoe saying he worked closely with ministers to reach agreement on the best way to distribute the funds. At a press conference, he denied the announcement was linked to the timing of the next general election which must take place by March 2025 at the latest. He said: “you can’t read anything into this”, adding that the work to allocate additional funding for the NDP was announced on Budget day last year and it “doesn’t make any difference to whenever the election is going to be”. Mr Donohoe said: “We have a whole variety of important projects over the country that were going to be more difficult to move ahead because of the rising cost of construction due to inflation. “We also have a number of other projects that we have to deliver for example, new school buildings, progress in building more hospital beds. “This project had to be completed to allow that to go ahead. “We brought it to conclusion today.”",0,1
2024/3/28,"Chris Donoghue leaves role as Coveney adviser to become Government press secretary under Harris Former Newstalk reporter and presenter became Simon Coveney’s media adviser in 2017 Government Buildings has poached a key adviser from Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment Simon Coveney. Chris Donoghue, formerly a reporter and presenter with Newstalk who joined Mr Coveney as his media adviser in 2017, will become Government press secretary when the new Fine Gael leader Simon Harris takes over from Leo Varadkar as Taoiseach on April 9th. Mr Donoghue’s move will intensify speculation about Mr Coveney’s future, although sources in his camp insisted there was no implication to be inferred from his adviser’s move to the Department of the Taoiseach. Mr Donoghue will join Sarah Bardon and Max Murphy as a member of Mr Harris’s core adviser team, while Joanne Lonergan, a former adviser to Mr Harris in the Department of Health and a Government Buildings veteran, is also expected to rejoin the team. There is an expectation that an economics adviser will also be recruited, while some of Mr Varadkar’s current team will be retained either permanently or on an interim basis. The promotion of Mr Donoghue is expected to come with a significant pay increase for the journalist-turned-political adviser. Mr Donoghue’s salary in his new role has not yet been decided. Nick Miller, the current Government press secretary, was paid on a scale equivalent to an assistant secretary general in the Civil Service, ranging from €156,000 to €178,000. Mr Donoghue, a former presenter and a breakfast radio co-host of former Fine Gael minister-turned-broadcaster Ivan Yates, is currently paid a salary of €114,347, a principal officer grade. He first joined Mr Coveney when the Fine Gael TD was minister for foreign affairs, working as an adviser around the difficult negotiations between the EU and UK on Brexit and the accompanying tensions that arose between the Irish and British governments. He was also very active as an adviser to the Minister at Iveagh House when Ireland won one of the temporary seats on the United Nations Security Council in June 2020, the first time the State sat on the 15-member body in two decades. Mr Donoghue dealt with the political fallout arising from the controversy over Mr Coveney’s ill-fated attempt to appoint former Independent minister Katherine Zappone as special envoy to the UN in 2021. He stayed on as the Minister’s press adviser after the December 2022 reshuffle in which the Cork TD became Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.",0,1
2024/3/29,"Does the Belfast Agreement need reforming, and can this be done now that Stormont is back? The agreement, now more than 25 years old, is showing signs of age. So how can it be reformed, if at all? Mark Hennessy, Ireland and Britain Editor, seeks the views of experts Nearly two decades ago, Sinn Féin’s Martin McGuinness and the Democratic Unionist Party’s Dr Ian Paisley created optimism when their first and deputy first minister double-act at the head of Northern Ireland’s government became known as “the Chuckle Brothers”. Today, Sinn Féin First Minister Michelle O’Neill and DUP Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly appear to have developed a similar working relationship – lightly called “the Chuckle Sisters” – but nicknames are never as good second time around, and this one has yet to stick. Despite the positive imagery, the 1998 Belfast Agreement – better known as the Good Friday Agreement – is showing signs of age, with reforms badly needed but difficult to bring about, while the Stormont government has failed to deliver good governance consistently, or at all. For years, there have been calls for reform. A quick Google search offers up 23,000 such references. However, the changes most easily made are the ones least likely to bring about improvement, while the ones that might do so seem impossible to bring about. Deeply involved as a Northern Ireland Office official in the 1990s negotiations that led to the 1998 peace deal, Alan Whysall today maintains a strong interest from a vantage point in University College London. In some ways, the agreement “is falling apart”, says Whysall. “Institutional fixes are not the answer to much of the malaise. We have done quite a bit of tinkering, but whether that has followed through with results on the ground is questionable.” Instead, Stormont needs cultural change, he argues. “Much of the problem is not about structures, but rather culture and momentum. The assumption has been to ‘just get the institutions back up’ and all good will come from that. That’s a mistake,” he says. So, what is needed? First, the Assembly’s rules to elect a speaker must be changed so an election cannot be blocked by either Sinn Féin or the Democratic Unionist Party ever again. If done, it would enable the Assembly to sit, committees to operate and oversight to take place. Most importantly, the election of a speaker and the operation of Stormont would make it less likely that either of the two main parties would again abandon their posts since their exit would not bring down the entire edifice. Currently, such matters require a cross-community vote made up of a majority of MLAs, including a majority of those designated as unionists, or nationalists, or a 60 per cent majority including 40 per cent of both designations. The mechanism was one of many things central to the negotiation of the agreement to deal with mostly nationalist fears then of being outvoted, but it has come to be used a tool by both Sinn Féin and the DUP to get their way. Instead, Lisa Claire Whitten, a research fellow in politics at Queen’s University Belfast, says the increasingly large third category in Northern Ireland – those who refuse to describe themselves as green or orange but are marked as “neither” – must gain greater voice. “We are now in a position where the ‘two-community assumption’ on which the 1998 agreement was based is no longer reflective of our demographics or, more recently, our electoral make-up here,” she said. Under her proposal, the “neither” group would be given equal weight, requiring cross-community votes to have the consent of each group, or a 60 per cent Assembly majority, with a minimum level of support from each designation. In addition, the use of the petition of concern – where 30 MLAs from two parties can block actions – should be amended to require parties to show that the issue deeply affects people in Northern Ireland and “that it is likely to persist”. However, Sean Haughey, a lecturer in politics and Irish studies at the University of Liverpool, argues that though non-aligned voters have been “for the last couple of years” the largest single group, that is not yet reflected in the make-up of the 90-seat Assembly, even allowing the growth of the Alliance Party. “Neithers are statistically the least likely to vote, so that’s why the system that prioritises two identities, even though they have lost a bit of salience over the last 25 years, is able to survive for as long as it has,” he says. “If the system prioritised the two identities a bit less, then you might get more buy-in from people who are neither unionist nor nationalist. That would be a healthy thing and would be good for democracy.” However, changes to designation rules would upset some outside Stormont, too, with the Orange Order warning that alterations would “be a fundamental departure from the architecture of the Belfast Agreement and would have profound political and legal repercussions”. Some “micro” changes would help, including better resources for Stormont’s committees, which are staffed by officials who have performed well in the face of extraordinary challenges and now must examine almost unmanageable volumes of European Union paperwork. For months before Stormont’s institutions were restored in February, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin argued that reform should come after restoration, and not before. “The issues are best looked at from a position of stability,” he said. However, reforms – even seemingly opaque procedural ones to Stormont’s rules – reduce the power of both Sinn Féin and the the DUP, who are now back in charge. So why should the two parties agree to changes that would affect them? “To be honest, I think we were closer to [reform] before the Assembly was restored. London was increasingly willing to pass changes. In a way the moment has passed. If we were going to do it, we should have done it before now,” says Whitten. Changes in voting patterns in Northern Ireland have been slower to come than they might have been because older people think that “yes, it’s not great, but it’s not what it was”, and that cultivates a level of tolerance that would be seen as surprising elsewhere, he says. There is appetite, Haughey believes, for changing the rules around the election of the Stormont Assembly’s speaker, which prevented the elevation of the SDLP’s Patsy McGlone in the past, even though he enjoyed a majority in the chamber. However, the rules governing the election of the First and Deputy First Minister, which now require Sinn Féin and the DUP separately to nominate candidates, will be harder to fix because both parties “do not want to modify this at all”, says the academic. “Privately, you will hear them saying that it doesn’t make sense for them to give up a very powerful veto that both of them have been able to use in the past to their advantage when the time has necessitated it,” says Haughey. In truth, though Sinn Féin’s fears of being excluded are greater, it is more likely that it would be the DUP which would find itself on the outside if reforms were made “because they have least in common with all of the other parties”. In a report last year, the House of Commons’ Northern Ireland Affairs Committee urged that the agreement should be independently reviewed, but that the work should be complemented by a citizens’ assembly. Besides ensuring the election of a speaker, the committee proposed, too, that the First and Deputy First Ministers should be retitled as “Joint First Ministers”, and that they would be elected by a weighted majority to prevent a veto by either main party. The DUP opposed the report, with its committee members publishing a minority paper. Just as significantly, Sinn Féin declined to give evidence. Later, it said that the institutions should be reviewed by Stormont’s Assembly and Executive Review Committee. This body has a majority of Sinn Féin and DUP members, an outcome that was not accidental. “That’s why I despair when SF suggests sending the reform proposals there since that is where ideas go to die,” says  Whysall. A Belfast Agreement 2.0 is unrealistic, Haughey believes, because “its original factory settings have strong democratic credentials”, unlike some of the “elitist and secretive” changes made later, such as the St Andrew’s Agreement. That agreement, in 2006, restored the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Stormont government leading to Paisley becoming first minister and McGuinness deputy first minister If a new version of the Belfast Agreement was ever contemplated, the expert view is that it should work alongside citizens’ assemblies to ensure that the pace is set by Northern Ireland society, not just its politicians, but such deliberative democracy was killed off in the past by Sinn Féin and the DUP. Whysall says civic society and business must be louder, though he urges the creation of a strong independent economic body – “something like the Economic and Social Research Institute in the Republic”, but an  enhanced version. “Both [Sinn Féin and the DUP] are very down on new ideas that they haven’t thought of or approved themselves. They don’t like new thinking. And we need new thinking,” he says. “The experience has been that if you say new things, you may displease politicians and that may not be good for you or the organisations that you lead.” He cites two anecdotal examples he knows of where businesspeople met with political displeasure at suggestions made. “Northern Ireland is a very, very small place,” he says. “There aren’t too many Ryanairs who can stick two fingers up to the government.”",0,1
2024/3/3,"Eamon Ryan accused of ‘holding too many portfolios’ amid deepening Coalition row over data centres Environment Minister wants to block future data centres that do not have their own carbon-neutral sources of energy Fianna Fáil politicians have accused Green Party leader Eamon Ryan of “blocking economic activity” and of holding “too many portfolios” in a deepening Coalition row over the future of data centres. The Irish Times on Saturday revealed that disagreements in the Government over the future construction of data centres came to a head during an angry row between Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan and Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney at a Cabinet committee meeting. Mr Ryan is seeking a change in Government policy that would block any future data centres that did not have their own carbon-neutral sources of energy. This was strongly opposed by Mr Coveney, who pointed out forcefully that had not been agreed Government policy at a Cabinet economic committee meeting. Fianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher has now accused Mr Ryan of “making unilateral decisions that have the capacity to undermine our country’s future economic prosperity” while party TD and Midlands North West candidate Barry Cowen said Mr Ryan was holding “too many portfolios” as he called for a Cabinet reshuffle. “Once again Minister Eamon Ryan is making unilateral decisions that have the capacity to undermine our country’s future economic prosperity,” Mr Kelleher said. “No one disagrees with the principle that most data centres should be able to produce their own energy needs using renewables. It is common sense. However, it might not be always possible in every circumstance, or at the very start of the data centre’s lifespan. “If the Minister spent as much time focusing on ramping up our offshore wind energy production as he seems to spend on trying to block economic activity in Ireland, we wouldn’t need to be worrying about how many data centres we have in this country.” “The Minister would be better off finding additional investment for EirGrid to expand grid capacity, for deep port development, and ultimately speeding up our offshore wind generation roll out. It is now 2024, and it is getting less likely by the month that we will hit our 2030-generation target of 5GW. This is serious. Ireland should be a wind energy superpower, but due to lethargy in certain Government departments, it is likely that we will fail to capitalise on our large potential,” Mr Kelleher said. Mr Cowen said Ireland is “sleepwalking” into a “digital recession”. “Ireland is closed for digital business and it will have a consequence for jobs and revenue. Big tech likes to locate near where its data is and pay its taxes in the same place.” “While Minister Ryan shrugs that data centres are not huge employers, the users of them are, plus the economic impact of no more investment in digital in Ireland will be severe affecting productivity, innovation, employment, global competitiveness, education, and healthcare. “The CRU, for some unfathomable reason, has become the custodian of our economic future with only very blunt tools at its disposal. Minister Coveney is right to be taking heated issue with Minister Ryan on it. While energy is a complex issue straddling economic, digital and climate action targets, the current structure of Government, with Minister Ryan holding too many portfolios, does not recognise this. A stand-alone Department of Energy should be part of a reshuffle of Cabinet responsibilities.” “It is ironic that the digital industry which, through investment and usage, will most drive Ireland’s climate action goals, especially on renewable energy targets and emissions, is the one being targeted for mothballing by Minister Ryan,” Mr Cowen said. Data centres use vast quantities of electricity, and now account for as much electricity usage as all urban households in the State, almost a fifth of the total. There have been calls for a moratorium on new data centres, as concerns over the impact on the grid – and the effect on Ireland’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions – grow. A spokeswoman for Mr Ryan said he is not blocking data centres. “He has stated on many occasions that data centres are critical to Ireland’s economic model. However, future data centres have to be zero carbon and part of the climate solution. “This would mean that they are powered by renewables and have backup power sources such as batteries and zero carbon fuels such as biomethane, hydrogenated vegetable oils (HVO) or hydrogen. “Most of the leading data centre companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon have already set themselves a target of 2030 to reach net zero. They can’t do that by opening new data centres that are not zero carbon.” She said data centres with prior or approval will go ahead “as we can’t break legal contracts”. “These will double the 2023 electricity use from 5 billion kWh (18 per cent of demand) to 10 billion kWh. The Irish consumer is spending a very considerable amount of money – which could be near €2Bn already – providing emergency generation to ensure the electricity grid is stable with all this demand growth. It is not clear yet that additional data centres wouldn’t cost consumers even more. “Further increasing the amount of demand needs to be done in a way that ensures we don’t have further electricity or gas security of supply issues. “Minister Ryan wants to ensure that this is the case, and has simply asked for this to be verified.”",0,1
2024/3/30,"Women outperform men in getting senior jobs in Civil Service, report finds  Top Level Appointments Committee concerned at lack of diversity in senior positions Women are outperforming men to secure top posts in the Civil Service, a new report prepared for Government shows. The most recent report of the Top Level Appointments Committee given to Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe in February to cover 2022 says that, over the previous three years, more women were recommended by it for appointment to senior positions than men – even though more men than women had applied for posts. “In 2022, 54 per cent of recommendations were for woman candidates and 46 per cent were for male candidates. For the last three years a higher percentage of women have been appointed at the top grades in the Civil Service.” The committee assesses candidates and makes recommendations to Ministers for posts at secretary general, deputy secretary general and assistant secretary general or equivalent. The report says that, in 2022, of the 486 eligible application, 64 per cent were male and 36 per cent were woman. By the time of the final interview stage, the gender balance was virtually equal – 51 per cent male and 49 per cent woman. However, ultimately of the 28 recommendations to Ministers for appointments to senior management positions, 54 per cent were women and 46 per cent were men. The appointments committee over recent years has expressed concern at a lack of diversity among those seeking and securing top positions. The 2022 report says that it is “desirable that the composition of the Civil Service should broadly reflect the ethnic make-up of the community”. The report for 2021 maintained starkly that there was still no ethnic diversity in the pool of candidates currently coming to preliminary and final interview stage, notwithstanding an “increasingly varied ethnic intake into the workforce”. The 2022 report for the first time provides details of the nationality and ethnicity of those applying for senior posts. About 90 per cent of applicants described themselves as white Irish or declined to reply. Just over 4 per cent said they were white of another background. About 3 per cent described themselves as being of Asian or Asian-Irish ethnicity. There was one candidate of black/black-Irish-African background. The report says while this data regarding the ethnic backgrounds of applicants is quite limited, it represents “a step in the right direction and will set the building blocks for more robust reporting going forward”. The 2022 appointments committee report says that although a greater number of eligible applicants in that year came from outside the Civil Service (58 per cent), the success rate for serving civil servants securing recommendation for appointment to a senior position is greater than for those from the outside the Civil Service. “In 2022, 82 per cent of candidates recommended for appointment were from the Civil Service.” Meanwhile, an analysis carried out by The Irish Times of secretaries generals running Government departments has found that very many were educated in the public system in schools run by Christian Brothers, religious orders of nuns or in community schools. Some joined the Civil Service straight after the Leaving Cert and secured their third-level degrees in night study or later in their careers. However, several have now qualifications from highly acclaimed universities abroad.",0,1
2024/3/30,"Highly paid, but highly scrutinised - the top civil servants at the helm of Government departments Most of the top mandarins running Government departments were educated in public schools, with some attending college at night or later in their careers The working life of a Government department secretary general can be complicated. In one high-profile department, senior figures tell a story of a minister of many years who, following a row with his officials, locked himself in his office and would not come out. The secretary general, the department’s most senior civil servant, made entreaties from outside the door. But the politician was not for budging. The minister, a wealthy man and long since dead, felt he did not have to work with the civil servants assigned to his department and wanted to hire his own staff to deliver the policies he wanted, threatening to consult the attorney general. The storm eventually blew over, but the tale encapsulates the tensions that exist occasionally between Ministers and their top officials. Secretaries general manage the operations of their departments and advise their Ministers, but they are not the only ones giving counsel; each Minister can, under law, hire two advisers. Gary Murphy, politics professor at Dublin City University, says over recent years Ministers have commissioned management consultants in advance of significant policy decisions, though – ultimately – secretaries general are the accounting officers at departments who must appear before Oireachtas committees and explain the implementation of those decisions. Some former senior civil servants maintain that while top civil servants are well remunerated, people at high levels in the private sector can earn considerably more. The counter argument is that it is very rare for a senior civil servant to be fired if things go wrong, unlike in the private sector. Prof Murphy says a recent trend has been for secretaries general to be appointed at a younger age. He says that whereas the late TK Whitaker – one of the State’s most famous civil servants and regarded as the architect of much of Ireland’s modern economic policy – was appointed on merit as the top Department of Finance official at the age of 39 in the 1950s, that was seen as a one-off at a time when most appointments were based on seniority. Appointing individuals in their 40s throws up problems. How long should they remain in post? Will long tenures block promotional opportunities for others? And how should the State compensate those who have to leave in their 50s, particularly if there are restrictions on their future careers under conflict-of-interest rules? Prof Murphy says this is an issue with which the Government is still grappling. In early March the Cabinet agreed new arrangements. In future secretaries general can remain in office for a maximum of nine years. Afterwards they can revert to the lower assistant secretary grade. Alternatively the Government can offer posts elsewhere or a one-year salary payment. So who are the country’s most senior civil servants? There are 18 who run Government departments, of whom five are women. There are four salary levels for secretaries general, ranging from just over €230,000 to close to €300,000. There are other Civil Service roles on similar pay such as the chair of the Revenue Commissioners, director general of the Attorney General’s office, the Chief State Solicitor and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Contrary to a possible view that these so-called top mandarins  attended private schools, many were educated in public schools. Two were actually in the same class in one Christian Brothers school. Some studied for college degrees at night or later in their careers. A minority previously worked in the private sector. The Top Level Appointments Committee (TLAC), which recommends candidates for the three Civil Service highest posts, has identified a drop-off in applications from outside the public system in recent years. Conor Brady, who was a member and later chair of TLAC up to 2022 (as well as a former editor of The Irish Times), says that there has been a trend of more men applying for posts but of more women ultimately being recommended for roles. He drew attention to the need for more appointments from different ethnic backgrounds. The TLAC report for 2021 says bluntly: “There is still no ethnic diversity in the pool of candidates currently coming to preliminary and final interview stage, notwithstanding an increasingly varied ethnic intake into the workforce. It is desirable that the composition of the Civil Service should broadly reflect the ethnic make-up of the community.” Pension arrangements were reformed in 2011 amid controversy over lucrative retirement packages. The then minister for public expenditure Brendan Howlin said in future there would be no added years for pension purposes and pensions would not be paid before minimum retirement age. In July 2012, Howlin gave the Dáil a list of senior officials then in place for whom the previous and more beneficial terms would still apply. Included on Howlin’s list were Robert Watt, who is now running the Department of Health, and Martin Fraser, who is  Ireland’s ambassador in London. The Department of Public Expenditure refused to comment on whether the terms were still in place  in light of the two men’s more recent appointments. While the pay and pensions may seem attractive, there is unease over some issues. The Irish Times understands that some serving senior civil servants believe the Government proposal for secretaries general to revert to assistant secretary level on completion of their term is not feasible. Another issue is the prospect of their pension pots attracting a large tax bill if the pots exceed the current €2 million limit to qualify for tax relief. The Government is reviewing these rules. Scrutiny by both media and politicians is also an issue for some top officials. Some argue that whereas senior figures in the private sector involved in controversies are dealt with in private, top civil servants have to go before politicians in Oireachtas committees in full public view. It is at these moments that their largely private backroom work is cast into a very public spotlight.",0,1
2024/3/31,"Who will be Ireland’s first directly elected mayor and what can they do for the €154,000 salary? Who is running and are there enough powers for the eventual holder of the new €154,000 per year job to be voted on in June? A car horn beeps as Green Party TD Brian Leddin walks through Limerick where voters will soon choose Ireland’s first directly elected mayor. “Go on the Greens. I love you so much,” a driver yells, apparently tongue-in-cheek. “My number one supporter,” Leddin quips. The man continues: “He’s actually one of the better candidates by the way, not that that’s a hotly contested position. I might give you a number 12, Brian.” Leddin laughs. “That might actually count in the end. It’ll all come down to transfers,” he replies. On Friday, June 7th – on the same day voters across the country will elect representatives to local councils and the European Parliament – the people of Limerick will have an additional choice; they will cast votes to select a mayor to lead a council that provides services to almost 210,000 people across the city and county. It comes five years after a plebiscite that saw voters approve the creation of the office of a directly elected mayor. Similar proposals in Cork and Waterford were defeated. The job comes with a salary of just more than €154,000, five staff and a budget of €8 million a year to be spent on mayoral projects and initiatives. The most significant power the mayor will have is proposing the annual budget for Limerick City and County Council. This will still have to be approved by councillors. The sums involved are considerable. The council’s draft budget for 2024 included €249 million for day-to-day services and €460 million for capital projects including housing and roads. The new mayor will also propose the five-year Local Development Plan and will have access to Cabinet Ministers with a set number of meetings each year. What they will not be is a North American-style mayor with major powers in areas such as policing or running public transport and schools. Local Sinn Féin TD Maurice Quinlivan claimed last year that the legislation underpinning the office was “very disappointing for most people in Limerick”. He said the mayor should have sufficient powers to ensure it “would not just be a ribbon-cutting position”. Sinn Féin has not yet selected a candidate; nor has Fine Gael or Labour. Leddin (44) defends the role and believes it can have clout in two of the big issues facing Limerick: health and housing. He says the “crisis” in the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick could be raised directly with the Minister by the mayor who will have an “incredibly strong mandate”. Leddin  says any Minister would be “very foolish” to ignore someone representing 210,000 people as there would be “blowback” for them and their party. On housing, he  says the mayor will be able to propose changes to the development plan to “zone for more houses in the right places”. He  says there needs to be a lot more people living in the city centre and more broadly Leddin believes Limerick can grow to be a “counterweight” to Dublin. As he sees it, the mayoral office offers the opportunity to plan for that. The role of mayor is also a work in progress: it will be reviewed after three years to see how it is working and if more power can be devolved. People Before Profit’s candidate Ruairí Fahy is sceptical of the powers the mayor will have in housing. He believes the Government “set it [the office] up to fail”. Fahy (32) highlights how the new Local Development Plan will not be brought in for another four years and  says any proposals on zoning would have to be aligned with national policy. Limitations of the office notwithstanding, one of the main priorities for Fahy, who  says he would take the average industrial wage if elected, would be to “build up trade union rights”. He suggests companies that work with unions should be given preferential treatment when it comes to council contracts. “I want to rebuild like the spirit of the Limerick Soviet in 1919,” he  says. Perhaps the most high-profile candidate in the race is former Department of Finance secretary general John Moran who is running as an Independent. The Irish Times meets him in an office attached to a 19th-century Presbyterian church he bought during the pandemic to “save the building”. One potential use he sees for it is as a home for his RHH institute, a think tank that would look at national issues “from outside the bubble in Dublin”. He says working on the building was “a bit of a chemo project”. Moran got the “all-clear” last year after being diagnosed with cancer in 2022. Why does he want to be mayor? “There is no place I’d like to make a difference than here in Limerick. It’s home. It’s been very good to me,” he  says. Moran (58) adds he does not want the new office to fail as it could offer an example for other places to follow to “break the centralisation of Government” in Ireland. He says the budgetary powers are “very significant” and they would be proposed in line with what the people wanted when they selected a mayor: “So it’s politics and finance coming together at a local authority level in ways we’ve never seen before.” He says his career in public policy and financing means “I know I can make a difference in bringing all of that to bear on this role”. In 2022 there was controversy over lobbying Moran carried out for US cab-hailing company Uber, as reported by The Irish Times. He argues it was a “sideshow” connected to an international story. Moran  says he would not be doing consulting work if elected mayor. He has stepped away from boards of charities in receipt of council funding and is resigning from the boards of Shannon Airport and the Limerick Economic Forum. Fianna Fáil’s candidate Dee Ryan, who is departing as Limerick Chamber chief executive to run for mayor, says health, housing and economic development are the big issues. She concedes there is no direct function in some of those areas but says the mayor can be “a critical convener” and “advocate” for the delivery of all Government services. Ryan (48) suggests there should be new powers in education, saying she would like to see all secondary students in the county learn to drive, sew and cook before they leave school. Ryan, formerly a member of the Labour Party and before that Fine Gael, made the headlines recently when years-old social media posts emerged in which she had criticised Fianna Fáil and party leader Micheál Martin. She says her views have changed and Fianna Fáil is “absolutely the right fit for me” and it was Martin’s time as taoiseach during the pandemic that “caused me to look at the party differently”. Another candidate from a Fine Gael gene pool is Helen O’Donnell who was married to the late TD, minister and MEP, Tom O’Donnell. She is running as an Independent despite her seconding of current MEP Seán Kelly to stand for Fine Gael just weeks ago. O’Donnell (63) describes Kelly as a friend and he knew she would be launching her non-party mayoral campaign the following day. On why she is not running for Fine Gael, she  says she believes the role of mayor should be “above party politics”. “If you go into a council with 40 councillors . . . and you’re aligned to one party, I think you will not have the same strength,” she  says. O’Donnell ran a catering business in Limerick for decades, is active in the Tidy Towns and previously chaired the board of all-island body Safe Food. She  says she would bring such experience to the role of mayor and Limerick is “crying out for leadership, vision and direction”. In recent days two more candidates have entered the race: Sarah Beasley of Aontú, who has been praised by party leader Peadar Tóibín for her outreach work with homeless people, and public health scientist Dr Laura Keyes who is running for Green Left party Rabharta. Another candidate, Social Democrats councillor Elisa O’Donovan (41) grew up in London with Irish parents. Her family moved back to Limerick when she was a teenager but she has faced some online abuse over her accent. O’Donovan has previously clashed with mayoral race rival Leddin. He previously apologised after derogatory remarks he made about O’Donovan in a WhatsApp group emerged in 2021. She did not accept the apology at the time. Both candidates focused on what their priorities would be as mayor in their interviews with The Irish Times rather than on their old dispute. O’Donovan  says safety within communities was a significant issue in Limerick, as is a lack of public amenities such as swimming pools and these areas would be priorities for her as mayor. She believes there should be more supports, including social workers and advocates, within the council for people seeking to access housing. Rejecting criticisms of the limitations to the mayoral powers, she insisted that greater democracy was “a good thing”. Her first ever vote aged 18 was for Ken Livingstone, the first directly mayor in London, she  says. “I remember exactly the same arguments coming up then and the mayor made that position what they wanted to make it.”",0,1
2024/3/31,"Donaldson resignation: Heaton-Harris welcomes pledges to ensure stability of Stormont Jeffrey Donaldson’s resignation letter to DUP said he intends to contest charges, it has been reported Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has welcomed pledges by Stormont leaders to ensure the stability of the power-sharing institutions in light of the “shocking news” relating to Jeffrey Donaldson’s resignation as DUP leader. In a statement released on Easter Sunday, Mr Heaton-Harris also welcomed the appointment of Gavin Robinson as the DUP’s interim leader. Mr Donaldson (61), who remains the Lagan Valley MP, stood down on Friday after being charged with sexual offences, a development which Mr Robinson described as a “devastating revelation” for the party. It has been reported that in his resignation letter to ruling party officers, Mr Donaldson wrote that he intends to strenuously contest the “historical” charges. First Minister Michelle O’Neill confirmed on Saturday that she has spoken with the other party leaders in the Stormont Executive – including Mr Robinson – since Mr Donaldson’s departure and they were in agreement there was no threat to the devolved Government. Speaking at a 1916 Rising commemoration event in Dublin on Sunday, she said her priority is “stability and cohesion”. Ms O’Neill said the parties now had to “knuckle down” and “do the business of Government”. Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly, who is joint head of Government in Northern Ireland, also called for stability and said she would “work closely” with Mr Robinson. Mr Heaton-Harris noted that it is now two months since the restoration of the Stormont Assembly following a two-year boycott by the DUP over post-Brexit trading arrangements. “In that time we have seen how the political parties of Northern Ireland can work together with the first and deputy First Ministers demonstrating in word and deed their commitment to making Stormont work for everyone in Northern Ireland,” Mr Heaton-Harris said on Sunday. “Following the shocking news of Friday morning, I welcome their commitment to ensure this great work continues and can guarantee the UK government will continue to work with all the political parties to build strongly on this progress. “We will continue to work alongside the Executive to make NI a great place to live, work and invest.” In an email message to party members on Saturday, Mr Robinson said the DUP was “not about any one individual”. “We are a party of MPs, MLAs, councillors, and scores of dedicated members across all parts of Northern Ireland,” Mr Robinson said. He said “the police service and courts must be allowed to complete their processes without interference”, adding that “nothing that any of us say or do must in any way compromise that process”. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) released two statements over the weekend saying it was “aware of ongoing commentary on social media platforms” and in the media, and warning of the need to protect the integrity of a live investigation. On Sunday, the PSNI said it was aware of the reporting of its investigation “timeline”, adding that it wanted to remind local communities and the media that speculation was “unhelpful, inaccurate and may ultimately have a negative effect on the criminal justice process”. In Dublin, presumptive taoiseach Simon Harris, who is due to be elected to the role on April 9th, said his priority was to “continue to support the institutions of the Good Friday agreement” in the wake of Mr Donaldson’s resignation. He promised that North-South engagement, as well as between Dublin and London would be pursued in “every way that we can”. Mr Harris said he was conscious that there is a criminal justice process under way. Senior sources in Dublin sought to downplay any immediate risk to the Stormont Assembly. One senior Coalition source said that they “anticipate the institutions will continue to operate and function notwithstanding recent events”. A second pointed to a planned meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council on April 8th, which will be one of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s final official functions, and argued that the business of relations between Dublin and Belfast was not focused on “personalities”. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said that the message from the political leadership in the North was that “they’re going to provide that stability and continue delivering for the people up north – I think that’s really important”.",0,1
2024/3/31,"Childminders who work in own homes will be able to take advantage of subsidies from September Incoming taoiseach Simon Harris is understood to be planning to fast track the move Childminders who work in their own homes will be able to take advantage of subsidies from September, under plans being progressed by the Government. Incoming taoiseach Simon Harris is understood to be planning to fast track the move, which had been planned already, with legislation before the Dáil breaks for the summer The legislation would allow childminders – and the parents whose children are cared for by them – to take advantage of the higher rates of subsidies introduced by Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman in the budget last year, which are due to take effect in September. They had previously only applied to those using childcare settings such as creches. On Sunday, Mr Harris said that housing remains the “biggest overriding priority” for the Government after he faced accusations of ignoring the area in speeches after he became Fine Gael leader. Speaking at an event in Dublin to commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising, Mr Harris outlined a range of policy areas to receive specific attention after he enters office. “I’m very conscious of the challenges being felt by small businesses at the moment, and very conscious around the cost of doing business in Ireland, particularly for small business,” Mr Harris said, adding that he would also focus on crime and public safety and that housing “remains the biggest overriding priority for Government”. Last week, Sinn Féin targeted Mr Harris for what it said was “radio silence” on housing in his speeches after becoming leader of Fine Gael, saying he “does not care” about people suffering due to the housing crisis. Mr Harris is preparing to become taoiseach on April 9th and is understood to be prioritising a range of areas, including the cost of education, in the limited time available to him in the role before the next election. He is set to announce that students will be able to earn €7,925 while working without impacting any grants. The new limit for earnings outside term-time, which replaces an old threshold of €6,552, is being introduced to reflect increases in the old-age pension and the national minimum wage. The income threshold for the special rate of maintenance grant has also increased from €25,000 to €26,200 for the same reason. Mr Harris said he was working on developing policy areas but that he was “very committed” to the programme for Government. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said at the same event that the three party leaders – himself, Mr Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin – met last week and said that the Government’s mandate should be seen out through to early next year. He said priorities were always being re-examined. Susi, the body that administers grant aid for students, will this week open applications for student grant funding for the 2024/2025 academic year. Already-announced measures in the budget provided for an increase in grant rates by up to €615, as well as increasing the income threshold for a 100 per cent student contribution grant to €55,924, and changes to income thresholds for maintenance grants. Mr Harris will also focus on law and order, planning to seek additional supports for An Garda Síochána and the roll out of body-worn cameras and moves on tougher sentencing. He has held meetings with party colleagues across the country as he prepares to become taoiseach. Mr Harris is set to meet the Fine Gael agriculture and business committees next week, and will be asking for proposals in policy areas within the first six weeks in office. A source said there will be a focus on farming and businesses as two areas which need significant support for the remainder of the year.",0,1
2024/3/4,"Referendum results ‘in the balance’ and turnout will matter, Varadkar says Fine Gael leader said ‘decisions are made by those who turn up’ as he appealed for voters to say ‘all families are equal’ The results of this Friday’s referendums on family and care are “in the balance” and good turnout is “really important”, according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.

In next Friday’s referendums, the Government proposes – in two votes – expanding the definition of family in the Constitution to recognise “durable relationships”, such as cohabiting couples and their children, and replacing the language around women’s “duties in the home” with language recognising care within families. Mr Varadkar said: “I’m certainly not taking the results of the referendum for granted. I do think it’s in the balance. “A lot of people are really getting around to thinking about how they’re voting now. “I’m appealing for a good turnout. “Decisions are made by those who turn up and it’s really important that we have a good turnout.” He said it is a referendum “that does matter” adding: “If there’s a No vote on Saturday morning, hundreds of thousands of children in Ireland will wake up to hear that Irish society has decided that their family isn’t a constitutional family, isn’t an equal family just because the parents aren’t married; and that’s not right. “If there’s a Yes vote we’ll be saying as a society that all families are equal and that the marital status of their parents shouldn’t affect that.” He said if there is a No vote in the care referendum “we will have very outdated language in our Constitution that will be there for the foreseeable future and we’ll be deciding not to recognise family care in our Constitution and I think that would be really unfortunate”. Some on the No side have criticised the new language on care is not going far enough. It was put to Mr Varadkar that some campaign groups for people with disabilities are concerned that the wording of the care referendum is focused on care within families and that the State has previously fallen short on obligations to support care. Mr Varadkar said the referendum is “about recognising the role and importance of family carers in our constitution for the first time and putting an obligation on the state to strive to support that care. That’s what it’s about.” “It’s also about deleting some very old-fashioned, very sexist language about women. “That’s why I’m encouraging people to vote Yes on that.” He said organisations like as Family Carers Ireland and the National Women’s Council support a Yes vote. Mr Varadkar added: “I appreciate that there are some people making the argument that if there’s a No vote, that a future government can come back with different wording at a different time. “There’s no guarantee that a future government will rerun the referendum, no guarantee that they’ll come up with wording that’s more acceptable to more people, no guarantee that that referendum would even pass. “The only guarantee is that if there’s a No vote, the sexist language about women in our Constitution will be reaffirmed and the Irish people will have voted not to recognise the special position of family care in the Constitution. “And I think that would be a retrograde step.”",0,1
2024/3/5,"Government spends nearly €460,000 hiring private jets for overseas travel in nine months Hiring private jet for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s overseas travel cost €300,000 over nine months The Government has spent more than €450,000 hiring private jets for overseas trips taken by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Micheál Martin in the last nine months, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show. Plans to spend €45 million purchasing a new jet were announced by the Coalition last year given the plane previously used for official travel, a Learjet 45, has in recent years been deemed unreliable and prone to breaking down. Figures show the cost of hiring private jets for Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin’s travel in the last nine months has been €459,000, with €300,000 of that spent on five overseas trips taken by the Fine Gael leader. The spend included €110,014 to hire a private jet for a two-day trip to the west Balkans in January. Mr Varadkar visited Kosovo, North Macedonia and Montenegro. A further €72,000 was spent hiring a jet to travel to Chișinău, the Moldovan capital, last May for a meeting of European leaders. Trips to Brussels last October and December cost €94,429, the Department of Defence figures show. Private jet travel by Mr Varadkar to Copenhagen, Denmark last November cost €24,700. The Government spent €158,000 hiring a private plane for a visit to Israel and Egypt last November by Mr Martin, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The department previously told the Air Corps that it had lost “all confidence” in the Learjet after it was unable to take off due to a fault when Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris was due to fly to Brussels last December. Following the incident, department secretary general Jacqui McCrum told Defence Forces Chief-of-Staff Seán Clancy she believed the plane should be taken out of service. In a statement, the Department of the Taoiseach said the cost of hiring private planes for official travel would be “reasonably comparable with the annual cost of purchasing and operating a replacement aircraft for the existing Government jet”. The travel, which included trips to international meetings, was vital and the Learjet was “often unavailable and is reaching the end of its working life,” it said. “When no other suitable Air Corps aircraft is available as a replacement, it is necessary to use an air taxi service,” it said. “Non-commercial air travel is critical for many international meetings and other occasions which frequently run over schedule, or where Ministers may have to return from abroad urgently for Dáil business.” Officials said Mr Varadkar also travelled by commercial flight on occasion, often on trips outside Europe. “Doing so for travel within Europe which is very frequent would entail being regularly absent from Cabinet meetings, Cabinet committee meetings and the Dáil, as travel that can be done by non-commercial air travel in a half-day can require a full day and an overnight when done using commercial airlines,” it said. The Department of Defence is in the process of purchasing a new mid-sized jet, which will be used for official travel, air ambulance patient transfers and helping Irish citizens abroad out of difficult situations.",0,1
2024/3/5,"RTÉ must now show it is no longer the same organisation outlined in the PAC report Report’s real value is in holding the massive amount of evidence on RTÉ scandal in single document The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has released its report on the RTÉ controversy – containing some 21 recommendations, including the headline finding that the broadcaster should be returned to the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG). This step now seems a foregone conclusion – supported by both the Government and Opposition, and it will give the PAC a standing role invigilating RTÉ. So, while its current role examining the controversy now appears to be drawing to a close, the broadcaster can expect close marking from the committee going forward. Expect those meetings to become a fixture of the political calendar. In truth, many of the report’s recommendations are not earth-shattering – but as several committee members pointed out during Tuesday’s launch, that in and of itself is an indictment of previous practices at the broadcaster. Labour TD Alan Kelly pointed to recommendation four, which says that all invoices issued by RTÉ should be clearly and accurately labelled as to the goods and services in respect of which they are issued – after a payment to Ryan Tubridy was incorrectly labelled as “consultancy services”. He asked: “What level are we starting at here?”, saying many of the recommendations are “fairly baseline”. Cormac Devlin, the Fianna Fáil TD for Dun Laoighaire said the same recommendation was “very basic – Anne and Barry-like, almost”. In truth, much of the most meaningful language in the PAC report is contained in its conclusions, rather than the recommendations, where the committee was less constrained in what it could say. It is in the conclusions where the report finds that a vital note of a meeting which ultimately approved the payments to Mr Tubridy suggests “an attempt to circumvent normal regulations and procedures on the part of RTÉ and to conceal the purported underwriting of the contact and payments to Mr Tubridy”. The report also concludes that the note “appears to refer to a commitment by then Director General Dee Forbes to guarantee certain payments to Mr Tubridy”. Ms Forbes has so far been unable to counter this assessment as she has not come before the committee, nor the Oireachtas Media Committee. Arising from the inaccurate publication of Mr Tubridy’s earnings, the report questions whether RTÉ may have deliberately misrepresented its list of top earners, which was always a lightning rod for criticism of the broadcaster. It takes the opportunity to assert in the conclusions that the use of the barter account matches the dictionary definition of a “slush fund”, and gives voice to its clear frustrations around the failure of Breda O’Keeffe, the former chief financial officer who left with a package of €450,000, to appear before it, saying: “The Committee is of the belief that Ms O’Keeffe’s refusal to attend frustrated the work of the Committee in resolving certain conflicts of evidence presented to it.” The report has real value in gathering a huge amount of evidence relating to the diffuse threads of the scandal, and compiling it into the a single document – including detailed timelines and a compendium of relevant source materials. However, it is up to the broadcaster to show it has transformed itself from the organisation described in the report, and one that is ready for tighter oversight that will last for years.",0,1
2024/3/5,"A third of measures in Government climate action plan to cut emissions not completed in 2023 Coalition plan commits to halving Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050 A third of the measures in the Government’s climate action plan for 2023 were not completed, according to the latest update on efforts to reduce Ireland’s carbon emissions. The Cabinet agreed to publish the fourth progress report for the plan which shows an implementation rate of 65 per cent with 35 per cent of actions not yet completed. In total some 188 of 290 actions were completed in 2023. “High impact” measures completed in the last quarter of the year included accelerating the delivery of rural public transport services and providing what has been described as a “record budget allocation for Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) retrofit schemes”. A Government spokesman said: “The report emphasises the need to focus more on project management and the need to focus on all sectors in the year ahead in order to meet the EU commitments [on reducing carbon emissions].” The programme for government commits to halving Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. Asked about the completion rate for measures in the action plan, a Green Party spokesman said there were “a number of smaller steps that weren’t completed and issues of bureaucratic delays in the system”. He said that overall “the trajectory emissions is very, very positive”, that they were down 1.9 per cent in 2022 and it looks like the reduction for 2023 “could be between 4 and 5 per cent”, though official statistics have not yet been finalised. Separately, Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney got Cabinet approval for draft legislation that would allow companies to hold general meetings via hybrid or virtual meetings. The general scheme – or outline – of the Companies (Corporate Governance, Enforcement and Regulatory Provisions) Bill 2024 also extends powers to the Corporate Enforcement Authority as a body with the statutory remit to investigate economic crime or corruption. Another draft law brought to Cabinet by Mr Coveney, the general scheme of the Employment (Restriction of Certain Mandatory Retirement Ages) Bill 2023, is to go to the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise for pre-legislative scrutiny. This is aimed at ensuring that a company which has set a mandatory retirement age below the State pension age cannot enforce this without the consent of the employee. Meanwhile, Tánaiste and Minister for Defence Micheál Martin got approval to formally nominate Defence Forces chief of staff Lieutenant General Seán Clancy as a candidate for election to the position of chair of the European Union Military Committee (EUMC). The EUMC is a forum for military consultation and co-operation between the EU member states in the areas of conflict prevention and crisis management. It is currently chaired by a senior military figure from Austria, another neutral country. The chair of the EUMC is selected by secret vote by the chiefs of defence of the EU member states. The vote will take place on May 15th, and appointment will take effect for three years from May 2025. If elected Lieut Gen Clancy will be in the chair of the EUMC during the period that Ireland will hold the presidency of the EU Council, the second half of 2026. He would be joined by eight to 10 Defence Forces members as support staff. Lieut Gen Clancy would relinquish his current role as chief of staff of the Defence Forces before taking up the EU role.",0,1
2024/3/6,"Proposal to deport EU migrants to third countries is not same as UK Rwanda plan - Varadkar The European People’s Party, a group including Fine Gael, has said it wants deals with non-EU countries for processing A proposed asylum policy by a group of European parties to deport irregular migrants to “safe” third countries is not the European equivalent of the UK’s Rwanda policy, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. The European People’s Party (EPP), an umbrella group representing centre-right political parties, including Fine Gael, has said it wants a series of deals with non-EU countries for asylum processing. People applying for asylum in the bloc could be transferred to a safe third country and undergo the asylum process there, according to the EPP’s draft manifesto. Speaking to reporters in advance of attending the EPP conference in Romania on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar denied suggestions that this proposal could be feeding into a far-right agenda or anti-immigrant sentiment. “What we’re saying very strictly is that anything that’s done – and we’ve been part of making sure this language was included in the manifesto – is that anything that’s done has to be in line with Geneva conventions and also the European Convention on Human Rights,” he said. “So it’s not the European version of what the UK is proposing in Rwanda in my view, it’d be something very different. But you know, for example, we know Italy has made an agreement recently with Albania that people seeking asylum could be processed there. And we have an EU arrangement with Tunisia which I’m not a huge fan of, but it’s more in that space.” Mr Varadkar said there was a need to “make a distinction” between those migrating legally, and those not abiding by the law. “We also need to be more firm [with] people who try to come to Ireland illegally as economic migrants when we have a work permit system that can be used,” he added. Fine Gael MEPs were also supportive of the proposal. Seán Kelly MEP said the pact will cover migration at a European level “for the first time”. “It is very important to have controlled migration, as opposed to irregular,” he said. “There will be some who wouldn’t be [entitled to asylum] and if they get into Europe, it’s very difficult to get them out and they are replacing people who are worse off than them or who are more entitled to it.” Deirdre Clune MEP said people seeking asylum need to be handled in a “fair and even manner”. “Not everybody can come to Europe for economic reasons,” she said.",0,1
2024/3/6,"Inclusion of ‘durable relationships’ in Constitution would result in ‘solicitors’ paradise’, says Aontú Party leader Peadar Tóibín appeals for ‘No-No’ vote in Friday’s referendums Recognising “durable relationships” in the Constitution would result in a “solicitors’ paradise”, according to Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín. Mr Tóibín, whose party is advocating a “No-No” vote in the two referendums, also argued that the amendment proposed in the second vote on care was an “empty husk”. In Friday’s referendums the Government proposes – in two votes – expanding the definition of family in the Constitution to recognise “durable relationships”, such as cohabiting couples and their children, and replacing the language around women’s “duties in the home” with language recognising care within families. Mr Tóibín was joined by Aontú local election candidates as the party held its final referendum campaign press conference in Dublin. He described the wording on “durable relationships” as a “definition-free phrase”, and suggested its inclusion in the Constitution would have “major implications” when it came to issues such as succession, taxation, social welfare, immigration and family law. He added: “We have enormous confusion over that particular definition, and that confusion will be a solicitor’s paradise. It will give the opportunity for many, many people to go to court to try to achieve their rights. And that’s not what democracy is about. Democracy is about either the legislature or the people understanding exactly what they’re putting into the Constitution and then the courts deciding in each individual case and how that law works out.” In the care referendum the Government is proposing to recognise care within families and insert further new wording that the State “shall strive to support such provision”. Many on the No side have argued this wording does not go far enough in placing an obligation on the State to support care, and criticised how it does not recognise care in wider society. Mr Tóibín said: “It seems to me that the care amendment was actually created by the Department of Finance” as he argued that “the objective of the care amendment is actually to put a ceiling on the rights of people to access care”. He accused the Government of “insulating themselves from any responsibility to carers or people in need of care in terms of their rights”. Mr Tóibín said he had seen “a very strong shift and move towards the No vote” as he had been canvassing. “People as they get to know more about the craziness of these particular amendments are definitely more likely to reject it.”",0,1
2024/3/7,"‘It has become too complicated and too confusing’: Voters’ referendums apathy spooks canvassers Behind the scenes the mood among Government TDs has soured in a hard-to-read vote Are the family and care referendums going to pass? This was the question on the lips of politicians  on the Yes and No side in Leinster House on Wednesday as both camps held their final press conferences, doubling down on their pitches to the electorate. An early sense of the picture will likely emerge from tallies in count centres on Saturday. We can expect to have a good idea of what the country has decided by around lunchtime on Saturday unless the margins are tight. Both sides were putting a professional face on it on Wednesday, but behind the scenes the mood among Government TDs has soured somewhat. Ministers and TDs from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have assembled canvassing teams that have fanned out in estates around the country, and what they have heard back has left many of them uncertain about the result. The first four politicians approached by The Irish Times on entering Leinster House on Wednesday all privately said they do not believe the care referendum – informally known among some as the “women-in-the-home” referendum – will pass. All are from different parties and all of them have been canvassing in recent weeks. “No,” said one TD bluntly when asked if the care referendum would be successful. “I can’t see it, but if it does pass it’ll be by the squeakiest of margins,” said another. A third TD offered this assessment: “The doors I’ve knocked on – some people don’t even know that there is a referendum coming up. Others know it is happening but haven’t a clue what it’s about. It has become too complicated and too confusing.” Fianna Fáil TD Paul McAuliffe said he had heard similar things from voters when out canvassing in the last week. “It is a complex matter, and a lot of people are struggling with that. Some people are taking that complexity and applying it to what is happening in their own life. They are asking, ‘what if my partner had an affair and went off with someone else?’. The worry now is that this complexity puts people off and they simply disengage.” McAuliffe was referring to the proposed family amendment, which would widen the definition of family to include families based on marriage but also other families based on other durable relationships. Questions have been posed by the No side around how many durable relationships a person could be in at one given time, and what impact that could have on people’s financial affairs. On the care amendment, which seeks to replace language that references a woman’s life and mother’s duties within the home with a text that recognises care between family members, McAuliffe said he has been surprised by the response of some women. “There are women who feel strongly about the proposal to remove these outdated references to a woman’s life in the home but there are also a lot of women who have said to me that their life has been in the home, and they feel that the State is somehow invalidating that choice that they made.” He predicts it will be “a very closely run referendum” and says there are a large number of people who still have not made up their mind. A broadcasting moratorium takes effect from 2pm on Thursday  and won’t be lifted until polling stations close.",0,1
2024/3/7,"Use of private emergency accommodation for children in care should be re-examined, says Martin Tánaiste tells Dáil it would take ‘considerable length of time’ to develop new capacity The current model of using private providers to run emergency accommodation for children in State care should be examined, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said. He told the Dáil on Thursday he did favour the idea of a stronger State involvement in providing such care, and said a “very alarming situation” had arisen at a private provider. However, Mr Martin said there should be “no illusion” that it would take “a considerable length of time” to develop both the physical capacity and multidisciplinary capacities that would be required. The Fianna Fáil leader was responding to People Before Profit TD Gino Kenny, who said there had been “startling stories” about emergency accommodation for young people in care in recent weeks. The Irish Times revealed last month that Tusla, the child and family agency, stopped placing children in care into emergency accommodation run by Ideal Care Services, after it identified serious concerns with the company. It was deemed to have put young people at risk by failing to carry out proper background checks on staff, having “fabricated” pre-employment screenings and altered Garda vetting files. Ideal Care, which is owned and run by Jossy Akwuobi (45) from Tyrrelstown, Dublin, was paid nearly €9 million by Tusla in the past two years, before the agency cut ties with the company. An internal July 2023 report said the standard of checks carried out on prospective care staff were “grossly inadequate to safeguard vulnerable young people”. Ten private companies were paid €58 million between them to run emergency accommodation for children in State care in 2023, according to Tusla. One company was paid nearly €13 million to accommodate children taken into State care in unregulated placements, known as special emergency arrangements. More than 180 vulnerable children are living in these emergency arrangements, which are often in bed and breakfasts or rental properties run by care staff from private companies. Mr Kenny said it was time to re-examine the current model and asked why should services be outsourced and could the HSE or Department of Health not run them instead. In response, Mr Martin said there was an investigation under way in relation to Ideal Care Services and added the current model should be examined. “I think we should be under no illusion that it would take a considerable length of time to develop both the physical capacity and multidisciplinary capacities that would be required to deal with vulnerable children,” he said. “But I think on balance, I do favour the idea of a stronger State involvement than just merely privately outsourcing. “It doesn’t mean that all privately outsourced facilities are bad or poor but certainly a very alarming situation and issue has arisen so we do need to examine the model.”",0,1
2024/3/7,"State sector facing increased competition to secure staff for top level positions, says Donohoe Minister defends establishment of new body but accepts it is ‘a sensitive topic’ The Government’s move to commission a new pay review for the chief executives of commercial state companies is due to increasing competition to secure individuals for these posts, the Minister for Public Expenditure has suggested. Speaking on Thursday Paschal Donohoe said there was a recognition within Government that there were “a small number of posts within our commercial and semi state sector that are really important to the delivery of very important projects within our country”. The Minister pointed to top-level roles in companies in the energy sector. He suggested that filling such top level positions was now taking place “in an increasingly highly-competitive context”. Mr Donohoe also said that “the competitive context for remuneration for some of those posts has changed”. “I appreciate this as a sensitive topic. But this is why I think it is (of) value to have an evidence based approach ... and this is why I think the process that we are putting in place is an important and timely one.” Earlier this week the Cabinet agreed to the establishment of a new body – to be known as the Senior Posts Remuneration Committee – which will assess the pay of top level personnel in the public sector. Mr Donohoe said on Tuesday that the first review to be carried out by the new committee will be of the pay of chief executives of commercial state bodies. This is expected to include an examination of remuneration of senior executives in organisations such as RTÉ, the ESB, VHI Healthcare and State-owned transport firms. The new committee could subsequently look at the pay of other groups in the public service. Last year an independent panel recommended to Government that a new pay body should look at remuneration provided to senior civil servants, judges, high-level gardaí and military personnel as well as hospital consultants.",0,1
2024/3/7,"Russia’s invasion will not stop at Ukraine and Europe must be defended - Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he does not believe Putin’s ambitions will stop at Ukraine Russia’s invasion will not stop at Ukraine and Europe must be defended, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. Mr Varadkar was speaking at the European People’s Party (EPP) conference in Bucharest, Romania on Thursday. The EPP is an umbrella group of centre-right political parties, including Fine Gael. In his speech to the congress, he said for more than two years, the world has “witnessed the brutal Russian assault on the people of Ukraine”. “I do not believe that Putin’s ambitions will stop at Ukraine. This is our war too and it’s not just happening on Ukraine’s territory. It’s happening all around us, in our seas, and in the form of physical and cyber attacks,” he said. “As one of my forebears said, a Europe worth building is a Europe with defending.” Mr Varadkar said this should be done by developing Pesco, a programme that seeks to raise co-operation on defence among participating EU Member States. “The EPP’s message must be that we stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes. Our message to the Kremlin is that Russia cannot win this war and we will do more to help Ukraine in the coming months and years. That involves military assistance, finance, humanitarian and political support,” he said. “The people in Ukraine are fighting, sacrificing their lives for European values. Fighting for democracy, liberty and the rule of law. The least we can do is provide them with the tools they need to defend their country and their homes – and progress EU accession negotiations as quickly as possible.” Mr Varadkar reiterated his call for a ceasefire in Gaza, stating the EEP shares the “outrage of the Israeli people” over the Hamas attacks on October 7th. “We have since then seen appalling violence inflicted by the Israeli Government on the people of Gaza. Palestinian civilians are not responsible for the crimes of Hamas and should not be subject to collective punishment,” he said. “We need a ceasefire, so food and medicine can get into Gaza, and we need the immediate release of all of the hostages. We also need the European Union to engage in the fight for a permanent peace between Israel and Palestine and Arab countries.” Mr Varadkar said as Europeans, they have a “duty” to bring the conflict to an end.",0,1
2024/3/8,"Sinn Féin proposals banning State investment in companies operating in Israeli settlements may be unconstitutional, Minister says Government privately accused of trying to slow the Bill down as bitter row breaks out over procedure The Minister for Finance has warned that laws proposed by Sinn Féin banning the State from investing in companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements may be unconstitutional. In a letter sent this week to the Dáil’s business committee – which itself is now embroiled in an internal row over the proposed Bill – Michael McGrath warned of a raft of issues with the proposed legislation brought forward by Sinn Féin’s foreign affairs spokesman John Brady. “I am concerned that in its current form the Bill raises significant constitutional and operational issues,” he wrote to Seán Ó Fearghaíl, the Ceann Comhairle and chair of the Oireachtas business committee. The Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill 2023 would force the National Treasury Management Agency and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to sell off any interests they hold in companies on a UN human rights database of companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. “The State has a duty to ensure that constitutional rights are adequately protected, and it does not appear that placing unconditional reliance on the UN list can adequately protect entities affected, or insulate the State from legal challenge,” Mr McGrath wrote. “I am concerned that the legislation may not sufficiently protect the constitutional right to fair procedures, and the property rights and reputational rights of affected parties may be adversely impacted for similar reasons,” he wrote. Despite the concerns emanating from the Department of Finance, the Oireachtas finance committee – chaired by Mr McGrath’s party colleague and Fianna Fáil backbench rebel John McGuinness – has accepted a request from Sinn Féin to waive pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, a step that would speed up its progress through the Oireachtas. But now a bitter row has broken out on the business committee, which must approve the decision to waive scrutiny, with opposition members privately accusing the Government of trying to slow the Bill down, arguing this is usually a rubber-stamping process. The notice to waive pre-legislative scrutiny originally came before the business committee last week, and it was decided to consider the request at this week’s meeting on Thursday. However, no decision was made due to the Ceann Comhairle not being present. He is on official business in Wales. This sparked a backlash from the opposition TDs on the committee, who privately argue that the situation is extremely unusual as requests like this are usually approved without discussion. Mr McGrath has said that scrutiny is vital and that further amendments to the Bill would be needed to make it constitutionally robust and compliant with European law. While some members downplayed the split on the committee, others said it was a “big row” and “bitter and heated”. One said the situation was “unprecedented” and “hot and heavy” while another described it as “outrageous”. The opposition members sought an emergency meeting of the business committee, which is now due to take place on Friday, with concerns that too much of a delay would mean the finance committee would be forced to begin the pre-legislative scrutiny process. Last year, the Government kicked the proposed legislation to touch with a timed amendment that stalled its progress from May last year to February this year. During that time, Mr McGrath sought the views of the foreign affairs committee on the legislation, which expressed a range of views on the proposed laws and suggested that the finance committee was better placed to advise on it. It is understood that Fine Gael TD Charlie Flanagan, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, was unhappy from the outset that the Bill was referred to his group as he felt there were competency issues. “We considered the matter and we informed Minister McGrath that we felt the foreign affairs and defence committee was not the appropriate committee to take it further,” Mr Flanagan said on Thursday. In his letter, Mr McGrath argues that no country has formally adopted the UN list in domestic law and “to do so would be a significant policy change for the State ... and for its relations with other states”.",0,1
2024/3/8,"Family and care referendums: Polls close with low turnout Around a quarter of voters cast a ballot in Dublin city but elsewhere in the capital turnout was as low as 16 per cent as of Friday afternoon Turnout in the referendums on family and care has been low in many parts of country, with polls having closed at 10pm. Almost 86,000 people have been added to the register since the start of the year, meaning some 3.5 million people were eligible to vote in today’s referendum. Around a quarter of voters cast a ballot in Dublin city but elsewhere in the capital turnout was as low as 16 per cent. Elsewhere just one in five voters had turned out in Galway by 4pm and average turnout in Cork’s rural constituencies was just over 22 per cent. The low turnout will be of concern to Government, and most of the Opposition parties which have backed ‘Yes-Yes’ votes in the referendums. The “family” referendum proposes to amend article 41.1 of the Constitution to expand State recognition of the family as founded not only on marriage but also on “other durable relationships”. The “care” referendum proposes to delete article 41.2, which recognises the contribution of a woman’s life within the home to the common good and provides the State shall “endeavour” to ensure mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to work outside the home. Across Dublin city constituencies turnout stood at just under 25 per cent at 4:45 this afternoon. This ranged from 20.7 per cent in Dublin Bay South to 28.6 per cent in Dublin South Central. Elsewhere in Dublin turnout in Blanchardstown was between 16 per cent and 22 per cent with Castleknock at 28 per cent. Clondalkin was around 22 per cent while Tallaght was at 19 per cent. Turnout picked up in in Dun Laoghaire and other areas by 8pm. Shankill St Anne’s turnout was 42 per cent and Shankill Scoil Mhuire turnout was 40 per cent. Dalkey turnout reached 40 per cent, while Sallynoggin reached 46 per cent by 9pm. Further north, Rush was on 27 per cent and Skerries had 29 per cent turnout. At around 7.30pm, the percentage was averaging around 42 per cent in Wicklow, Arklow. Turnout at 8pm over the combined Bray Greystones area in Wicklow late in the evening was 47.9 per cent. At 4:30pm some 22 per cent of voters had turnout out in both the rural hinterlands of Athlone and Mullingar, though in the two towns it stood at 19 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. Granard in Co Longford was reporting 18 per cent turnout around the same time. As of 5pm Cork county had an average turnout across its three constituencies of 22.3 per cent. In the last general election turnout there at the same time was 43.5 percent; it was 27.2 per cent in the 2019 European Elections and 34 per cent for the referendum n repealing the 8thAmendmnet in 2018. In Kerry turnout was 28.4 per cent in Killarney, 28 per cent in both Tralee and Kilgarvan, and 20 per cent in Listowel as of late Friday afternoon. Turnout in Galway was 20 per cent as of 4pm ranging from 14 per cent in Castlegar to 22 per cent in Kinvara. In Mayo 17.6 per cent of the electorate had cast a ballot in the Ballina/Foxford rural area though as many as 25.5 per cent had turned out in Westport. In Wexford turnout ranged from 19.4 per cent in New Ross to 22.4 per cent in Gorey and 23.2 per cent in Ballyfad. Turnout across Tipperary was just over 20 per cent, with Clonmel standing at 22 per cent. The “family” referendum proposes to amend article 41.1 of the Constitution to expand State recognition of the family as founded not only on marriage but also on “other durable relationships”. The “care” referendum proposes to delete article 41.2, which recognises the contribution of a woman’s life within the home to the common good and provides the State shall “endeavour” to ensure mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to work outside the home. A proposed new article 42B provides the State “shall strive to support” the provision of care “by members of a family to one another by reason of the bonds that exist among them”. President Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina Higgins cast their vote at St Mary’s Hospital, Phoenix Park, mid-morning. It was the President’s first outing in public since he was released from hospital on Thursday. He spent a week in St James’s, having been taken there on February 29th after complaining of feeling unwell. He was taken to hospital as a precaution on foot of medical advice and remained there for an extra few days for tests and in order to monitor his blood pressure. President Higgins was assisted while walking into the polling station, but posed for photographs after casting his ballot. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar earlier cast his vote at Scoil Treasa Naofa on Donore Avenue in Dublin, while Tánaiste Micheál Martin voted at St Anthony’s Boys National School in Co Cork. Voters should ideally bring their polling card but should also bring a form of identification to the polling station. If a person is on the register but their polling card has not arrived, they can still vote but must have valid ID, which includes documents such as a passport, driving licence, student card or public services card. Upon arrival, voters will be asked to give their name and address and then will be given a stamped ballot paper to take into the booth. The ballot paper will contain short instructions on how to vote and details of the referendum proposal. It asks whether voters approve of the proposal. They should “X” in either the “yes” or the “no” box on the paper, then fold it and place it in a sealed ballot box. The first question deals with Article 41.1.1 and Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution – the family proposals. This will be on a white coloured piece of paper. The second ballot paper – the 40th amendment relates to the care referendum. This will be on a green coloured piece of paper. Voters are reminded that they cannot take any photos or “selfies” in the polling station as it may compromise the secrecy of the ballot. Also, do not write anything else on the ballot paper as it could ultimately be deemed as a spoilt vote. Canvassing within 50m of the polling station is also prohibited.",0,1
2024/3/9,"Amid all the finger-pointing, it’d be unwise to overlook central thrust of referendum results Governments will likely be more cautious about making constitutional changes in future The fears of Government, Opposition parties and the army of non-governmental organisations that made up the broad Yes-Yes campaign for referendums that never grabbed the public’s attention – and when they did, antagonised many of them – were realised spectacularly on Saturday as soon as votes began tumbling out of the ballot boxes. With propositions that were confusing and unconvincing, and a campaign that was lacklustre and unenthusiastic, few had expressed any confidence in recent days that the referendums would be passed. But even if it was not a surprise, it was still a shock, in a way. When veteran Labour figure Kevin Humphreys tweeted a picture of a tally sheet before 9.30am with a more than 12 to one lead for the No side, the message flew around political and media circles: it’s going down. As tallies from around the country began to arrive in a trickle and then a flood, all bearing the same message, any room for doubt quickly evaporated; the rejection of the Government’s proposition was complete and overwhelming. By the afternoon the Taoiseach was down in Dublin Castle, acknowledging defeat and trying to put a brave face on it. Not easy; it’s a helluva defeat for his Government. It wasn’t just the Coalition’s proposition, of course; it was supported by almost all the Opposition parties, with the important exception of Peadar Tóibín’s Aontú. It was also backed by trade unions and the Government-funded NGO sector – including groups like the National Women’s Council of Ireland – which made much of the running throughout the campaign. Many of those who purport to speak for workers, women and people with disabilities supported the proposals – but very many workers and women and people with disabilities did not. Obvious questions now present themselves for these groups. On this question, the NGOs seemed to speak principally for themselves. This Government and probably future ones are likely to take note of that. There was a predictable rash of finger-pointing at the Government – the campaign was anaemic, the wording unclear, the polling date gimmicky, the process first too long drawn out, and then rushed; all true. Reasons for the extraordinary result abound; they are always plentiful. But amid all the clamour on Saturday evening to blame the Government for how it arrived at and then supported these proposed constitutional changes, it would be unwise to overlook the central thrust of what has just happened. Asked to change the constitutional references to the family, voters overwhelmingly rejected that option. Sure, there were people who might vote Yes for a slightly different amendment, or a stronger proposed change, enshrining the rights of disabled people to care; but the fact of this result stands. People were offered a reasonably understandable change, and they said no thanks – by an enormous margin. That reverses the trend of several recent referendums. It does not mean that general trend of society has lurched permanently to a conservative one. But it definitely means that future governments will not assume that similar constitutional changes are a foregone conclusion. For one example, the proposed addition of justiciable social and economic rights in the Constitution, a campaigning goal of some NGOs, maybe looks a bit different now. Future governments will tread these steps with more caution. One obvious lesson is that you shouldn’t run a referendum unless you’re sure it’s on something that people definitely want. There was an unavoidable sense of people being taken for granted in this. Unwise. The Taoiseach’s insistence – and it was, apparently, his – on holding the referendums on International Women’s Day was a hammy gesture that may have ended up antagonising some voters – especially women who found that their children’s school was closed because it was being used as a polling station. It might not be the end of gesture politics, but it will certainly give would-be gesturers pause for thought in future. As the result unfolded, some senior Government figures were wondering quietly about the future of the hate speech legislation. The look on the faces of those Ministers brave enough to go to Dublin Castle told enough about the scale of the Government’s embarrassment. But does it have any lasting political consequences? That’s uncertain. Governments have lost referendums and gone on to prosper. On on other occasions, however, a losing referendum has been a portent of electoral doom. The key thing for the Coalition is to ensure that the mistakes that gave rise to a proposition found so unconvincing by voters, and a lacklustre campaign by the politicians, are understood, addressed and not repeated. But there is little confidence around that they will be. As the time for big political decisions comes ever closer, doubts about the judgment of the Government’s leaders are now plain for everyone to see. This is clearly a Government that has not done politics well of late. It does not have long to turn that around.",0,1
2024/3/9,"Growing anxiety in Government over results of referendums after voters stay home   Just 25% of electorate had cast a ballot in Dublin city as of last night  There was growing anxiety within Government over the results of the referendums on family and care as voters stayed home in their droves after a campaign that failed to ignite widespread public interest. Reports of slow voting across the country throughout Friday led to scepticism among some in Government circles that turnout would reach 40 per cent. There was also a level of pessimism at the likely result with sources conceding that one or both of the referendums could fail on a very low turnout. As of early Friday evening, just 25 per cent of voters had cast a ballot in Dublin city, but in Galway by 8.30pm turnout was reported as being between 29 per cent and 41 per cent. By late Friday evening reports of turnout in different parts of the Dún Laoghaire constituency ranged between 37 per cent and 46 per cent. At around 7.30pm, the percentage was averaging around 42 per cent in Wicklow-Arklow, while turnout in the combined Bray-Greystones area in Co Wicklow late in the evening was 47.9 per cent. There were two referendums on Friday. A Yes vote in the first one would expand the definition of family in the Constitution to recognise “durable relationships”, such as cohabiting couples and their children. The proposal before the people in the second vote was to replace the language around women’s duties “in the home” with language recognising care within families. Counting of the votes begins at 9am on Saturday and there is to be two separate declarations of the results expected later in the day. Confusion over the propositions being put to the people as well as the perception that the campaign failed to capture the public’s attention were cited by Government sources concerned that No votes could be returned when the results roll in. One source said: “We’re not conceding defeat, but it’s not looking good”. Another said it was “definitely possible to lose”, while adding “no one can call it.” Green Senator Pauline O’Reilly, who ran her party’s campaign, said on Friday evening “there’s a way to go yet but obviously turnout is a concern”. She highlighted how all of the major political parties backed Yes-Yes votes as did “a huge amount of civil society”. “On the face of that you would have to think that it should pass but it really is about whether people got their voters out or not,” she added. Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik said she hoped to see more people turning out after work on Friday evening and she said she was hearing “many saying they have swung back to a Yes-Yes over the last day or so.” However, she added: “It will be very tight.” Campaigners for a No vote in the family referendum have highlighted uncertainty over the meaning of the phrase “durable relationships” and argued that introducing the wording into the Constitution could have implications in areas like succession, immigration and taxation law. In the care referendum many on the No side have criticised the lack of recognition of care in the wider community in the proposed amendment and many argued that the Government’s wording does not place enough obligation on the State to support care. Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín, whose party campaigned for a No-No vote, said his sense was that turnout will not be at “the very bottom of the expectations”. He said that while he was “cautious” he sensed “momentum” for the No side adding: “My own hunch is the care amendment is most likely to fail and the other one will be tight.” A previous referendum with low turnout – the vote on children’s rights which saw 33.5 per cent of voters turn up to the polls – passed by 57.4 per cent, a lower support level than expected. Turnout on Friday will not reach anywhere near the 60.5 per cent of the electorate that voted in the referendum on same sex marriage or 64.1 per who turned up for the referendum on repealing the Eighth Amendment on abortion.",0,1
2024/4/1,"ATMs must dispense notes smaller than €50, Oireachtas committee urges Draft report calls for greater availability of €20 notes to facilitate those on low income or social welfare as well as review of accessibility of withdrawal machines   The Government should mandate banks and other ATM operators to ensure notes lower than €50 are available to customers, an Oireachtas committee has found. A report by the Oireachtas finance committee, which has been examining the Coalition’s Access to Cash Bill, recommends that an obligation be inserted into the legislation to make denominations of cash lower than €50 available. The report highlights a submission made to the committee during its hearings by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (Mabs) which stated that the amount of €20 is regularly unavailable for withdrawal. This, the report states, has the effect of “forcing a minimum withdrawal of €50 and that the consumer may not have this amount in funds available to them, especially if they are low-income and/or in receipt of social welfare”. The committee also recommended that access to public transport, as well as geographic factors and the demographics of the population in an area are given “special consideration” when an assessment is being made of any potential local deficiency. The report also welcomes a provision in the legislation that allows the Minister for Finance to prohibit or cap the charging of access fees for the use of ATMs. Committee chair John McGuinness said that access to cash must be accommodated for people who want to continue using it. “Whatever the future of banking is, the Government must insist that banks provide cash facilities and without customers being penalised,” he said. The committee has also recommended that it be a prescribed requirement that ATM operators provide accessible machines which have a headphone socket and a text-to-speech functionality to assist those with visual impairment, and that a review be conducted on the accessibility of the existing network with a view to updating the stock if it is required.",0,1
2024/4/1,"Government seeks pre-election pact with tech giants amid ‘supercharged’ disinformation threats Threats ‘deeply corrosive to our democratic discourse’ are focus of EU and domestic leglislation  The Government will seek a pre-election pact with technology giants to counter disinformation in the face of “supercharged” threats in advance of local, European and general elections to be held in the next 12 months. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien and Minister of State Malcolm Noonan have written to the lobby group for some of the largest tech multinationals operating in Ireland, asking them to talks later this month, warning of threats that are “deeply corrosive to our democratic discourse”. The companies will be asked to sign up to a new Irish Election Integrity Accord on the eve of elections that come after the longest period in the history of the State without a nationwide party political contest being held, the Ministers wrote to Technology Ireland. A range of EU and domestic laws have been passed or are in train to attempt to counter the threats of disinformation and misinformation interfering online in the electoral process. The Government, however, has yet to commence parts of the Electoral Reform Act, which are seen as of key importance as they introduce new obligations on online platforms and buyers of advertising. The accord will consist of a “set of principles for the sector”, they wrote, which will cover both political advertising transparency and disinformation in line with the Electoral Reform Act passed by the Government in 2022, as well as EU requirements and a “reaffirmation” of existing codes of practice. A summit of the companies with the Department of Housing, which is in charge of matters pertaining to elections, has been proposed for April 24th in the Mansion House. The development of the accord is to be led by An Coimisiún Toghcháin – the Electoral Commission. The Ministers wrote that the years since the last nationwide elections in Ireland have seen “a number of disinformation threats to our democracy become supercharged”. “Domestic bad faith actors and foreign interference operations are now potentially empowered and emboldened by the expansion of generative AI [Artificial Intelligence] models and a fragmented social media landscape,” they wrote. In a separate letter to An Coimisiún Toghcháin, the Ministers wrote that their goal would be the agreement of a “set of principles for the sector and the State to work by to safeguard our democracy over these crucial next few months”. In response to a parliamentary question to Green Party TD Marc Ó Cathasaigh last December, about why parts four and five of the Electoral Reform Act had not been commenced, Mr O’Brien said that the European Commission had raised a concern that a number of provisions in part four were incompatible with parts of the EU’s ecommerce directive. Part four mandates that an online platform has to label the text of an advert as a political advert and link to a transparency notice including information about the buyer, and confirmation of whether micro-targeting of an individual was involved in purchasing the ad, along with a range of other information. Online platforms will have to keep an archive of political advertisements for at least seven years, and also apply measures to verify the identity of a buyer, alongside other obligations which will fall on the buyer themselves. In December, Mr O’Brien said it would be necessary to bring part four into line with a proposal from the EU on transparency and targeting of political advertisements, which was expected to be formally adopted early this year, and after which he said his department would give further consideration to any necessary adjustments to the uncommenced parts of the Irish Act.",0,1
2024/4/10,"Harris holds first call with Sunak as Taoiseach but Troubles Legacy Act not discussed Leaders of both countries hold ‘very good call’ before Taoiseach spoke to North’s First Minister and Deputy First Minister Taoiseach Simon Harris and British prime minister Rishi Sunak discussed Northern Ireland but not the UK government’s controversial Legacy Act in their first phone call since the new Fine Gael leader took office. The Government is challenging the British legislation in the European Court of Human Rights. The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 will also halt future civil cases and legacy inquests. The UK government’s laws are opposed by many victims groups in Northern Ireland and all the main Stormont parties. A Government spokesman confirmed that Mr Harris did not raise the Legacy Act with Mr Sunak saying it is a matter before the courts and that there will be a “more substantive bilateral meeting in person” in the future. Asked if the pair discussed the upheaval in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) the spokesman said “not in any great depth”. Jeffrey Donaldson resigned as DUP leader last month after being charged with sexual offences. It is understood that he intends to contest the allegations strenuously. The  Government spokesman said Mr Harris and Mr Sunak “didn’t get into any matters that are before the courts”. East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson has been appointed as the DUP’s interim leader. Mr Sunak is said to have asked Mr Harris for an update on the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) which met on Monday and which the new Taoiseach attended while he was still Minister for Higher Education. It was the first meeting of the NSMC in years as the engagements had been stopped during the collapse in powersharing due to the DUP’s concerns over post-Brexit trading arrangements. The  Government spokesman said: “Prime minister Sunak was clear that we have the platform now with the progress that’s been made on Brexit and Stormont he wanted to use it.” The spokesman said the two leaders discussed the situation in the Middle East and both agreed that a ceasefire is needed in Gaza along with access for humanitarian aid. Mr Sunak congratulated Mr Harris on his election as Taoiseach and the 20-minute conversation was described as “a very good call”. The Government later confirmed that Mr Harris also spoke by phone with First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly. A statement said: “The Taoiseach spoke of the importance he attaches to his role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, including today the 26th anniversary of its signing. “With this week’s re-establishment of the North South Ministerial Council, the Taoiseach and the First Minister and Deputy First Minister looked forward to renewed, positive North-South engagement in the months ahead,” it added. Mr Harris also spoke by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A Government statement said they “discussed the current situation on the ground in Ukraine as the country continues to resist Russian aggression” and “what more Ireland, the EU and wider global community can do to support Ukraine and President Zelenskiy’s peace plan”. After the call Mr Harris said: “I felt that it was important that in my first full day as Taoiseach I spoke with President Zelenskiy “I took the opportunity to reassure him of Ireland’s unwavering support of Ukraine and its brave people as they continue to defend their country against the imperialist aggression of President Putin and to restore their sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Mr Harris added: “Russia is posing a grave threat to all of Europe and the people of Ukraine are not only fighting for their freedom but are also defending our shared values as Europeans.” He said he told Mr Zelenskiy that Ireland “will continue to assist his country in any way we can and for as long as it takes. Russia cannot and must not prevail”. Mr Harris said the two leaders “welcomed the recent decision by the European Council to open EU accession negations with Ukraine and I offered any assistance Ireland can provide in supporting their efforts to achieve EU membership as soon as possible”. He also said he told the Ukrainian president that will advocate for support for Ukraine’s peace plan with “global partners” with whom Ireland has a close relationship, including African countries. Mr Harris said he stressed that Ireland will continue to work both in the EU and the UN “to hold Russia accountable, including through supporting further sanctions against Russia”. He said: “I expressed my pride in the Irish people and the warm welcome they have extended to over 105,000 Ukrainians fleeing the war and thanked them for the valuable contribution they are making to Irish society. We will continue to offer refuge to those seeking safety from this devastating conflict.”",0,1
2024/4/11,"Harris rejects Israeli criticism that he failed to mention hostages in Dáil speech Taoiseach’s spokesman said Ireland has repeatedly condemned  Hamas attack on October 7th The Government has rejected a denunciation of Simon Harris by the Israeli foreign ministry over his first speech to the Dáil as Taoiseach for not specifically mentioning Israeli hostages held in Gaza. The ministry also expressed “fury” over the intention of the Irish Government to give formal recognition, along with several other EU countries and Norway, to a Palestinian State. The foreign ministry issued a statement on Thursday in which it contended Mr Harris neglected to mention the Israeli hostages captured by Hamas on October 7th during his maiden speech to the Dáil as Taoiseach. A spokesman for Mr Harris told The Irish Times on Thursday that the Taoiseach has been even-handed at all times in his response to the conflict, and that included condemning the taking of the hostages and calling for their release. “By any fair analysis Ireland has always condemned the atrocity Hamas committed on October 7th and called for hostages to be released. The Taoiseach has repeatedly said it,” said the spokesman. During a brief reference to Gaza during his maiden speech as Taoiseach on Tuesday, Mr Harris condemned the Hamas attack of October 7th, which resulted in some 1,170 deaths, according to Israeli figures, and also condemned the “disproportionate” military retaliation by Israel, which has resulted in over 33,000 deaths according to the Hamas-run Ministry for Health in Gaza. Mr Harris said: “In Gaza, we are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe and seeing innocent children, women and men being starved and slaughtered. We have not been silent on the unforgivable terrorist actions of Hamas on 7th October, nor can we be silent on the disproportionate reaction of the Israeli Government. As a country, we will play our part in helping bring about a ceasefire and a lasting peace. Later this week I will travel to Brussels and deliver those messages to Europe on behalf of the Irish people.” In its statement, the Israeli foreign ministry claimed Harris “forgot” to “mention the 133 Israeli hostages who have been rotting in Hamas tunnels for the past six months”. It continued: “After the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, there are those in Ireland who persist on being on the wrong side of history.” The denunciation of Ireland was one of a number made by Israeli in recent days, possibly as a response of an initiative, involving Spain, Ireland, Malta, Belgium, Slovenia and Norway to give formal recognition to a Palestinian State within months. Israel also issued a statement this week berating Norway for allegedly ignoring the fate of the hostages. The Taoiseach is currently in Brussels and is expected to raise the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and repeat Ireland’s call for an immediate ceasefire when he meets senior EU leaders. Mr Harris will meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola in Brussels today.",0,1
2024/4/11,"Ireland one of six EU countries willing to recognise Palestinian state Idea has gathered momentum since Tánaiste hosted dinner of like-minded foreign affairs ministers in Brussels last month Last month in Brussels, Tánaiste Micheál Martin hosted a dinner on the margins of the EU meeting of foreign ministers. Ministers from Spain, Belgium, Slovenia and Malta attended the dinner. The subject matter was the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza and what these five like-minded EU countries could do to help the peace initiative talks in the Middle East progress to  achieve a ceasefire. There was another item that was to the forefront of the politicians’ minds at the dinner, and one which Martin wanted to push. That was to act in concert to push for formal EU recognition of the State of Palestine. The formal EU position is that it will recognise the Palestinian state when it is established as part of the two-state settlement set out by the Oslo Accord three decades ago. This would provide for two states within the territory, with the borders being those that were there pre-1967, the year Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza during the Six-Day War. However, this group of EU countries is now of the view that they can no longer wait for the Oslo Accord to be implemented and that Palestinian statehood should be recognised even in the absence of a two-state solution. That view is beginning to gather pace within the European Union and the European Economic Area. In what turned out to be co-ordinated moves on Tuesday, Mr Martin told the Dáil that further delays in recognising the Palestinian state was “not credible or tenable any longer”. He said he would bring proposals to Government on this matter soon. “But be in no doubt recognition of a Palestinian state will happen,” he said. At around the same time, the Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez announced that he would hold separate discussions this week with Norway, Ireland, Portugal, Slovenia and Belgium to try to recognise Palestine. He said he wanted recognition for Palestine by July. The Tánaiste’s disclosure of these moves effectively stole some of the thunder from Simon Harris’ big day on Tuesday but needed to be done on that day. He also said that the talks on this specific change have been ongoing for about six months. There have been signs for some months that this will happen. At the Summit meeting in March, the leaders of Ireland, Malta and Spain said they “stood ready” to recognise Palestinian statehood. Their argument was that the recognition of the State was necessary for any future peace process.  A month earlier then taoiseach Leo Varadkar had confirmed that a group of member states were in talks to give formal recognition to Palestine. He said that with Palestine having the status of a state, it would allow “a more equal negotiation to happen”. In a wider context, this forms part of participation by some of these countries in the overall peace initiative in the Middle East designed to bring the conflict in Gaza to an end. Ireland’s engagement began with its efforts to get Irish citizens trapped in Gaza through the Rafah Crossing. The Tánaiste has met senior Government figures in Jordan, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar in recent months and he and the department have contributed to the wider peace efforts. Martin told the Dáil last month that Ireland was actively engaged with regional partners on the finalisation of a peace plan currently being developed by a core group of Arab states. “I discussed this with the Jordanian and Palestinian foreign ministers in the Munich security conference and senior officials from my department have travelled to the region in recent weeks at my request to further consult key partners on the details of this plan and how Ireland, with a number of European partners, could support this initiative,” he said. Martin’s move on Tuesday was also giving effect to a Programme for Government commitment to recognise the State of Palestine “as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict, or in advance of that, when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a two-State solution or protect the integrity of Palestinian territory”. Government sources said on Wednesday that Ireland believes it is best to take that step in concert with other countries, and not unilaterally. This group of states will put the matter on the agenda of both the next European Council meeting in April and also on the agenda of the next meeting of foreign ministers. “We want to keep the momentum up. There is a growing determination to do this tied to the peace initiative. We want a concrete proposal [for recognising Palestine] to be put,” said the sources. The sources concede that some EU countries will not be willing to recognise the Palestinian state. Countries like Germany, Austria, Hungary and Greece remain strong supporters of Israel notwithstanding the substantial toll of deaths and casualties caused by its bombardment of Gaza. It is more likely that a subgroup of EU countries will move of their own volition to recognise Palestine by July. The political difficulties caused by this issue within the EU is not evident in most other parts of the world. Of the 193 members of the United Nations, 139 recognise the State of Palestine, while nine of the 27 EU member states already recognise the Palestinian right to statehood.",0,1
2024/4/11,"Pets from Ukraine cost the State up to €1 million a month Martin says this was only one aspect of Ireland’s ‘humane’ response and ‘reflects the best of what we are as a people’ Tánaiste Micheál Martin has defended the State paying up to €1 million a month for the transport and accommodation of pets from Ukraine as a “humanitarian” and “compassionate” response at the time. He said nobody realised at the outset that the war in Ukraine would last more than two years and it was only one aspect of Ireland’s response to the conflict. It was a “decent response that reflected the best of what we are as a people”, he told the Dáil. Mr Martin was replying to Independent TD Michael McNamara who said that “in addition to the moneys being spent by the Department of Agriculture transporting pets from Ukraine, the Department of Integration was paying for their accommodation, up to €20 per pet per night, but it varied from centre to centre”. Mr McNamara highlighted a report in the Irish Daily Mirror that at the peak of provision in November 2022, more than 1,800 cats, dogs and other pets that travelled to Ireland with their Ukrainian refugee owners and were accommodated by the State. Mr McNamara said it was “not possible to establish actually how much money was spent because there is just one invoice covering everything from various accommodation providers, and they do not differentiate between the cost of accommodating pets and accommodating humans, which, obviously, we are required to do under international law”. Ireland, unlike other countries, seemed to have had no policy at the time, he said. “Some had a policy of ‘absolutely no pets - we cannot take your pets’. Others had a policy of ‘Yes, you can take your pets with you, but you pay for them yourself’. “Ireland was paying for them, but we do not know how much money was spent. Based on the number of pets in the country, which was seven times more than the Department of integration knew about, it could have been up to €1 million a month.” He asked if the Tánaiste was happy with “the oversight of spending in that Department when you were Taoiseach and are you happy with the oversight of spending now?” Mr Martin said “we all responded in a humanitarian way at the time. No one believed the war would go on for two years.” He told Mr McNamara that “there is a context to all this. I will always recall, when I was leaving Kyiv, the train station there. There is an exhibition in the train station which recalls the horror facing the population of Ukraine at the time. There were desperate photographs of mothers with their children looking out the windows at their husbands, in-laws, grandparents - frightened children. That was the scene. “We all responded in humanitarian way. At the time, no one believed the war would go on for two years. I didn’t believe that it would go on for two years.” The Tánaiste added that “the essential response we made at the time was to be a humane response”. He said that the Clare TD might two-and-a-half years later “instance one aspect of that response. I just think there was a context at the time in which this country responded. “We can be overly negative about ourselves all the time. I think was a decent response that reflected the best of what we are as a people.”",0,1
2024/4/11,"Sinn Féin is watching the polls and beginning to panic, says Stephen Donnelly Minister for Health suggests party wants early election as it sees Government making progress in key areas Sinn Féin is watching the polls and are beginning to panic, the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said. Sinn Féin has repeatedly called for a general election following the resignation of the previous taoiseach Leo Varadkar. An opinion poll commissioned by broadcaster Newstalk and published on Thursday found that a majority of people believed that a general election should be called now. However, speaking on Thursday, Mr Donnelly argued that Sinn Féin wanted to go to the country now as it could see that the Government was making progress in key areas such as housing and health. He also appeared to suggest that Sinn Féin was concerned that the party was falling back in opinion polls. Mr Donnelly said that five-year parliamentary terms were very clearly set out in legislation. “The Government is seeing through a five-year terms. That is the right thing to do. There is a lot of progress being made. We know the trolley numbers are falling in healthcare; the waiting lists are falling and new services are being rolled out. ” “There is the best part of a year to go [to the next general election].” The Minister said that the focus of the Government was implementing the programme for Government agreed between the three Coalition parties. “We live in a parliamentary democracy and certainly in healthcare I have every intention of working with our healthcare workers all over Ireland to keep the waiting lists going down and the trolley numbers going down and to keep adding more beds and new staff. ” Asked about comments by Sinn Féin that the Newstalk poll showed that the people wanted an early election Mr Donnelly said: “Sinn Féin get elected to Westminister and they take the money but not the seats. That is their choice. They got elected to Stormont but collapsed the assembly in the face of Brexit. Now they do not seem to respect the clear five-year parliamentary terms we have in the Republic. “I think Sinn Féin are watching the polls. I think Sinn Féin are beginning to panic and are calling for a general election. “Sinn Féin can see more houses being built, they can see hospitals being built, they can see more beds being added and [that] waiting lists and trolley numbers falling.” The Newstalk poll, carried out by carried out by Amárach Research following the appointment of Simon Harris as Taoiseach earlier this week, showed younger people more enthusiastic about an early election. It found that 73 per cent of those under 35 years who were polled wanted an immediate general election compared with 40 per cent of those over the age of 55.",0,1
2024/4/11,"Doubt over whether June referendum will go ahead amid fallout from family and care votes ‘Lessons learned’ from heavy defeats in family and care referendums a factor in Coalition’s considerations on vote originally planned for June There is doubt over whether the referendum on the Unified Patent Court (UPC) will go ahead in June as planned amid the continued fallout from the heavily defeated family and care referendums last month. There are strong indications that the vote will be postponed with the Government due to make a final decision on how it will proceed next week. It is understood that “lessons learned” from the unsuccessful referendums have been part of the considerations on whether or not the UPC referendum takes place on the earmarked date of June 7th, the same day as the local and European elections. One source said enthusiasm for holding the referendum is “less than stellar” while another said there is a “reluctance” to go ahead with it in June given the outcome of the referendums in March. Another Government insider said the decision on the UPC referendum proceeding or not has not yet been taken but highlighted how the required legislation has not yet been passed the Oireachtas. It is currently at committee stage in the Seanad. The Cabinet is expected to decide next week on whether or not to proceed with the referendum in June. The UPC is designed to provide a one-stop shop for litigation on patents whose decisions will be binding on participating European Union member states. A Yes vote in a referendum would mean Irish patents would be valid in the 17 EU member states that have signed up to the UPC system. The move has been long called for by business groups and individual sectors of the economy, such as the pharmaceutical trade. In 2013, Ireland signed an agreement providing for the establishment of the UPC between contracting states, but an amendment to the Constitution is needed as it entails a transfer of jurisdiction in patent litigation from the Irish courts to an international court. Newly-appointed Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke will bring a memo to Government next week on “the next steps” according to a statement from his department. It said: “He will outline the Government’s position at that stage.” Fianna Fáil senator Malcolm Byrne said: “It is in Ireland’s competitive interest to join the European unified patents system to make obtaining and protecting inventions much easier for Irish inventors.” Mr Byrne – who has been selected as his party’s director of elections for the UPC referendum – told The Irish Times he hopes it proceeds in June as planned. “This is a very clear referendum. The only implications are whether we move towards a European patent system with a court to determine disputes. It’s only about patents, nothing else. “And for Ireland not to be in membership it’ll be bad news for Irish business and for Irish creators.” He said the issues at stake were “not emotive”, adding: “It’s a very simple question. Do we join the European patent system or not?” He added: “If you’re an Irish inventor or if you’re an Irish business or a spin out from a university and you develop a product you want to make it as easy as possible to make sure that that product is protected and recognised and that’s what the patent courts system is about.” Mr Byrne said he would be “disappointed” if it was postponed, saying: “It’s a bad sign for the new Government if they move in this way.”",0,1
2024/4/11,"Two more candidates enter race to become first directly elected mayor in country Fine Gael and Labour councillors become latest names of list of people hoping to become mayor of Limerick Two more politicians have entered the race to become the first directly elected mayor in Ireland. Councillors from Fine Gael and Labour have announced they are running in the June election for mayor of Limerick. Daniel Butler, a Fine Gael councillor, is seeking his party’s nomination. Taoiseach Simon Harris is due to attend a selection convention in Limerick on Friday evening. Mr Butler is expected to be selected unopposed unless another Fine Gael candidate enters the race. He said the new role of directly elected mayor is “a huge opportunity to drive an agenda that puts Limerick first” an he would “fight for everyone in the city and the county” if he is elected. Former Fine Gael leader, minister and Limerick City TD Michael Noonan endorsed Mr Butler, saying he would “make a fine mayor for all of Limerick”, adding that he has “worked tirelessly” as a councillor since 2014. Mr Butler was previously the mayor of Limerick between 2021 and 2022, though this was the existing ceremonial role, not the new office which has powers in the areas of finances and planning. Meanwhile, Labour councillor Conor Sheehan vowed to be the “mayor for homes” if he is elected as he announced he is seeking his party’s nomination. He said he wants to fight for “a generation of people who are being locked out of the chance to buy or rent affordable housing”. He said that during the campaign he plans to talk to communities about their housing needs and promised to publish a plan on “how I will deliver a future Limerick where everyone has a safe and secure place to call home”. The Labour Party selection convention is on April 22nd. The mayoral election is happening on June 7th, the same day as the local and European elections. The job comes with a salary of just more than €154,000 and a budget of €8 million a year to be spent on projects and initiatives. It is the first office of its kind in Ireland and the most significant power the mayor will have is proposing the annual budget for Limerick City and County Council. This will still have to be approved by councillors. The other declared candidates in the race are: The new mayor will also propose the five-year Local Development Plan and will have access to Cabinet Ministers with a set number of meetings each year.",0,1
2024/4/11,"Dáil told cancer outcomes worsening because of Government underfunding Tánaiste rejects Sinn Féin claims in Dáil that Ireland is a ‘laggard’ in treating disease Tánaiste Micheál Martin has rejected claims that Ireland is a “laggard” in treating cancers after the Government was accused of failing to properly funding services, leading to worse outcomes for patients. Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty told the Dáil that the HSE sought an extra €20 million to fund the national cancer strategy in this year’s budget but received zero. He said that radiation machinery was lying idle in hospitals due to staff shortages, and that surgeries were being cancelled as a consequence. And he pointed to the Oireachtas Health Committee hearing on Wednesday where the Irish Cancer Society told TDs and Senators that cancer services had been underfunded for five of the past seven years, and that health outcomes “may have stagnated or even disimproved”. The Donegal TD said that Taoiseach Simon Harris as minister for health “didn’t properly fund the cancer strategy in any of the years when he was minister and it has been underfunded in most of the years since”. The Government refused the HSE the €20 million extra it sought for cancer services, Mr Doherty said. “You deliberately underfunded the health service with disastrous consequences for patient safety.” But Mr Martin said the Government was entitled to look for value for money, adding that just because somebody asked for additional funding they could not simply agree to it for every agency or undertaking, without efficiencies. He said the Government had made very significant investments in cancer services, with €7.7 billion extra provided to the HSE over the past four years. An additional €40 billion had been provided for new treatments and 148 new cancer drugs had been authorised. He said 65 per cent of people diagnosed with cancer between 2014 and 2018 were still alive five years later, compared to 44 per cent 20 years earlier. “Our mortality rate for all cancers had dropped by 11 per cent over the past decade, with cancer of the trachea and lung down 19 per cent, and breast cancer dropping by 10 per cent.” He said “the success of cancer strategies and the centralisation of cancer services, which many Deputies opposed at the time, are evident”. Mr Martin added that when he was minister for health he had to “fight political battle after political battle across the country when centralisation as oncology services occurred”. But he said that probably was the “most impactful policy evolution” on cancer survival rates. Meanwhile, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has separately said that there had been unprecedented levels of investment in cancer services in recent years. He said the Government had fully funded the national cancer strategy over two-year period. However, he said that this year was “different” and that there “needs to be an additional focus this year on productivity”. He said that “cancer survivorship rates in Ireland are going up and up and up”, that screening services were improving and that he was “having conversations with oncologists who are talking about the eradication of cervical cancer in our country” The Minister said that the Government was increasing college places to fill key posts in cancer and other services and that his department and the HSE were also working on an international recruitment initiative.",0,1
2024/4/12,"Micheál Martin is now arguably as dominant as Bertie Ahern was at party’s helm Despite internal criticism of the Cork TD over the years, the Tánaiste now leads a more settled party.  If you scroll back two years, most TDs in Fianna Fáil would have predicted with a fair degree of accuracy the narrative of the early months of 2024. The party would continue to struggle in opinion polls. There would be a change of leader. A fresh face from a new generation would emerge to revitalise the party in advance of the local and European elections and then lead them into the general election. And it all came to pass. Except it happened for Fine Gael, not Fianna Fáil. The party with seemingly continuous leadership issues since 2010 has persevered with its leader, while the party which seemingly had an anchored structure now has a new leader charged with reversing Fine Gael’s wane. Fianna Fáil will go into this summer’s elections with a leader who has been in situ for 13 years and arguably as dominant as Bertie Ahern was at the party’s helm. All the predictions of Micheál Martin being eased out — that we have heard periodically over the past decade — have come to nothing. By the summer of last year, most Fianna Fáil TDs had come around to the view that not only would Martin not be stepping down any time soon, but he would be leading the party into the next general election. There was no dramatic showdown. It just happened in the way rust happens. Fianna Fáil TDs and Senators might sometimes struggle to distinguish the party from others but it is in a far more settled place than Fine Gael has been. Unlike its Coalition partner which will face into the general election without a third of its sitting TDs, the vast majority of existing Fianna Fáil deputies will be standing for re-election. “We are in a bit of bother,” a Fianna Fáil TD who has experienced the slings and arrows of high office confided several months ago. “But we are in a better place than Fine Gael.” That said, the party’s opinion poll ratings have been mediocre but there is a view in the ranks that there are “silent” Fianna Fáilers and the true level of its support is a little higher. The first true test of that will be the forthcoming local and European elections. This weekend’s ardfheis in the Royal Convention Centre in Dublin is very much focused towards those elections. Ardfheiseanna have long been a vehicle to allow parties to showcase policies, messages and candidates to the public, especially when an election is dawning. The schedule features ministers highlighting all the party’s main policy areas: building more homes; safer streets; rural Ireland; financial stability; and the disability sector. There is no reference to climate change or immigration on the agenda. Indeed the only motions relate to foreign affairs and defence, and the continuing debate within the party on neutrality. Fianna Fáil might have been a little more sure-footed than Fine Gael of late. But Simon Harris’s arrival could change the dynamic, certainly in the short term, for the June elections. In reality, too, both have been lagging well behind Sinn Féin — and Independents for that matter. Fianna Fáil gained 12 council seats in the local elections in 2019 to win 279. It will be hard-pressed to repeat that performance now, especially given the reality that Sinn Féin — which lost half its 160 seats in 2019 — will double its tally, and then some. Expect the focus of Fianna Fáil this weekend to be on the European elections, which have more potential for claiming a win. The choice of Dublin as the location is very much geared towards sitting MEP Barry Andrews, who will be in a dogfight to retain his seat in the capital. Billy Kelleher should be expected to hold his seat. And in Midlands North West, having Barry Cowen on the ticket should give the party its first seat in that constituency for a decade. Getting three MEPs elected would be portrayed as a win, although there are slim hopes that Lisa Chambers or Niall Blaney in Midlands North West or Cynthia Ní Mhurchú in South could pull a rabbit out of a hat. It looks unlikely to be Martin’s last ardfheis. His colleagues now believe he won’t go to Europe and will lead the party into the next election. It’s hard to see the party regaining its once-dominant position in Irish politics but, for now, it’s not slipping into irrelevance. It also needs to be able to show much stronger gains on its two big promises for this Government: building more homes and improving health services. Another big quandary will come when Martin eventually steps down as leader because unlike in Fine Gael, there is no obvious successor. And that could cause problems.",0,1
2024/4/12,"Micheál Martin repeats position Fianna Fáil will not go into Government with Sinn Féin Tánaiste does not rule out possibility of working with party entirely but potential coalition would not be possible with current SF policies Tánaiste Micheál Martin has repeated his position that Fianna Fáil cannot go into Government with Sinn Féin. Mr Martin cited policy differences but did not rule out the possibility completely, saying coalition would be impossible if Sinn Féin maintains the policy positions it holds. The Fianna Fáil leader was speaking in advance of his party’s ardfheis which opened in the Royal Convention Centre in Dublin on Friday night. In his opening address to delegates Mr Martin excoriated Sinn Féin and its record in Government in the North, and in the Oireachtas in the South. “In the three elections which will be held over the next year they are hoping to bulldoze their way to power,” he said. “They hope they can avoid scrutiny, avoid the hard questions everyone else has to answer – but we’ll make sure that they have to answer for the reality of their policies and the terrible impact they would have on Ireland.” Expanding on that theme when speaking to reporters, Mr Martin said Fianna Fáil could not negotiate with Sinn Féin “if it maintains policy positions they’ve been wanting to maintain on Europe, like it’s flip flopping on the whole area around the Middle East, for example, one week, they were not calling for the expulsion of the ambassador and the next week they were.” In his speech, Mr Martin also emphasised education, farming and housing as well as immigration. In a signal of the Government’s toughening policy on this issue, he told delegates. “We also fully understand that the global migration crisis is causing huge pressures, particularly in the European Union. “Our policy has to be firm and fair. In asylum cases we have to respect humanitarian needs, but also join with others in speeding up decisions.” Mr Martin defended the party’s decision not to invite Israeli ambassador Dana Erlich to the ardfheis. He said the reason for not inviting her was that Fianna Fáil was “not satisfied” with what was going on in Gaza. He said that a distinction needed to be made between a political party and a State. He said he believed in diplomacy and did not believe in expelling Ms Erlich. “I was asked 12 months ago to expel the Russian ambassador. I was asked to expel the Iranian embassy,” he said. “I believe in keeping challenge channels of communications between governments open through their diplomats.”",0,1
2024/4/12,"Formal recognition of Palestine coming closer, Harris and Spanish PM say Taoiseach says scenes of ‘hunger, thirst, mutilation, death of innocent children, women, men, the destruction of hospitals, schools’ must stop Taoiseach Simon Harris and the Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez have said the time when a group of six European countries formally recognises Palestine as a state is coming closer. The two leaders held a half-hour meeting in Government Buildings on Friday which was dominated by the war in Gaza. Speaking afterwards, the Taoiseach said a number of EU states agreed last month that they would move to recognise Palestine when the conditions were right. “That point is coming much closer and we would like to move together. The people of Palestine have long sought the dignity of their own country and sovereignty,” he said. “When we move forward, we would like to do so with as many others as possible. And then we send a decision to the people of Israel.” Mr Harris added that the people of Palestine deserved equal respect. “In a region where people of all faiths and traditions came together in peace, I know that is our shared aim.” Mr Sánchez said it was not possible at present to say when the countries would move to recognise the Palestinian state. “As of now, no one can discern clearly the phases or times for the process. We are in unchartered terrain.” He said it was imperative to move forward because if countries stood still the result would be “more suffering, more deaths, more resentment and more conflicts in the region”. Mr Sánchez said he believed Israeli prime minister Binyamin Natanyahu had no clear peace plan. “Therefore, we believe that the international community and countries like Spain and Ireland must be involved and seek to bring solutions to this terrible situation.” Both leaders said they agreed the need for an immediate ceasefire, to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza and to free the hostages that are still being held by Hamas. Mr Sánchez said the solution needed to recognise the coexistence of two states, Palestine and Israel. “The international community will not be able to help Palestine if it doesn’t recognise its existence. That is why our two countries have undertaken together to recognise Palestine as a state as soon as possible when the appropriate conditions are in place and we also undertake to support the recognition of Palestine as a member of the UN with full rights,” he said. “We do this with two clear objectives. The first is to send a message of hope to the millions of Gazans and Palestinians who are suffering in the region. And secondly, to show the world that in Europe there are also countries willing to defend respect for the international order in all cases.” Asked about Israel’s strong criticism of the move, and its claims that it was giving legitimacy to Hamas, Mr Harris said he had condemned the Hamas attack on October 7th and the taking of hostages. “It’s entirely possible to call out the horrors that the state of Israel suffered at the hands of Hamas while also saying that there must be an immediate cessation of violence, that the scenes we’re seeing in Gaza in terms of hunger, thirst, mutilation, death of innocent children, women, men, the destruction of so much civilian infrastructure, hospitals, schools ... that has to stop. The only way forward here is for a political peace process that brings about a two-state solution,” he said.",0,1
2024/4/12,"Simon Harris: ‘new kid on the block’ is seen as an ‘unknown quantity’ in Brussels Whistle-stop series of meetings a dry run for the Taoiseach ahead of EU summit next week As he made the rounds on his first foray on to the international diplomatic stage as Taoiseach, the perception of Simon Harris in Brussels is largely as someone who is seen as an unknown quantity. The new leader met European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday afternoon, before heading to Warsaw to have dinner with a group of other EU leaders. The meeting with Dr von der Leyen was down in the commission president’s diary as a fairly standard introductory sit-down, without a set agenda. Speaking afterwards, Harris said the pair discussed Ireland’s plans to recognise the state of Palestine, a new EU overhaul on toughening the asylum system, agricultural policy, the war in Ukraine and relations with the UK. The two spoke for a little over half an hour in what a commission source described as a “very friendly” meeting. The 37-year-old Fine Gael leader is viewed as an “unknown quantity” by the Brussels bubble, according to several officials. “He is the new kid on the block,” another long-time Irish official said. As a minister, he would have been over and back to the EU institutions for meetings, and when in the health portfolio co-ordinated with counterparts on Covid-19 during the pandemic. The fact that Harris is being advised by Phil Hogan, the former EU trade commissioner who is still well-regarded within the Brussels circuit, is something that has been clocked by observers, one EU official said. During his brief visit, the new Taoiseach also made time to meet Manfred Weber, the German MEP who heads up the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre right grouping that includes Fine Gael. The largest group in the parliament and around the summit table, the EPP will be an important constituency to cultivate connections within. Harris starts at a time when the business of policymaking has slowed down, and the political manoeuvring over the shape of the next commission is starting to ramp up. Von der Leyen is seeking a second term as president and the coming months will see plenty of back room horse-trading over the allocation of EU commissioner portfolios. Not long after the meeting with the commission president, Harris went to the airport for a flight to Warsaw to meet several EU leaders, including European Council president Charles Michel, followed by an informal dinner with the leaders of Poland, Spain, Greece, Finland, Estonia and Luxembourg. The whistle-stop series of engagements served as somewhat of a dry run in advance of the full summit of EU leaders next week, where leaders from other countries will be looking to get the measure of the new Irish leader.",0,1
2024/4/13,"IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva secures second term after Paschal Donohoe links come to nothing Bulgarian returns to role, with Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to ‘continue work in Irish and European politics’ Head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kristalina Georgieva has secured a second term in the role that was hotly tipped for Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe. Ms Georgieva was the sole candidate nominated for the position as managing director, according to the IMF’s executive board and will serve a second five-year term beginning in October 2024 This is despite extensive speculation that Mr Donohoe, who is also the current head of the Eurogroup gathering of EU finance minister, was to be her successor. Ms Georgieva, a Bulgarian native, has been the IMF’s managing director since 2019 and was commended by the board for her “strong and agile” leadership during her term, “navigating a series of major global shocks”. Mr Donohoe’s prospect as the next head of the IMF has followed him closely since financial news agency Bloomberg reported in December that he was in the running to assume the position after Ms Georgieva’s term finished. Since then, Mr Donohoe has repeatedly reiterated his position that his sole interest in public life is in “continuing my work in Irish and European politics”. However, the minister never explicitly ruled himself out, fuelling speculation until last month. Speaking in Brussels last month, Mr Donohoe said his focus was on his existing work, and he did not believe there would be a potential vacancy in the role as head of the IMF. “Kristalina Georgieva has done an excellent job,” he said. On her appointment, Ms Georgieva said she is “deeply grateful” for the trust and support of the board. “In recent years, the IMF has helped our member countries to navigate successive shocks, including the pandemic, war and conflicts, and a cost-of-living crisis. “We also stepped up our work on climate change, fragility and conflict, and the digital transition, in line with their increased significance for macroeconomic and financial stability, growth and employment,” she said. Ms Georgieva added that the IMF has contributed to countries’ capacity to deal with high uncertainty and abrupt shifts in economic conditions. “We are and will remain a transmission line of good policies for our members and will continue to strive to be more effective, incisive and a welcoming place for countries to come together to tackle global challenges,” she said.",0,1

Cynthia Ní Mhurchú (Ireland South) had arrived in election car festooned with her photo. Midlands North-West candidates Senators Lisa Chambers and Niall Blaney are also among the party’s six European election candidates. Fianna Fáil members were enticed to meet the candidates with free coffee, tea and a scone. Behind them on the wall a large banner read “Europe Matters”, an appeal to voters to consider their European election vote as carefully as they would their general and local election candidates. Taoiseach Simon Harris has said he is proud of the decision to hand the Minister of State responsibility for the Gaeltacht to Fianna Fáil. Mr Harris acknowledged that his Irish is not good but he plans to take classes. Asked what she thought of his ambition, native Irish speaker Ms Ní Mhurchú said “feicimid”. Coffee with the candidates is part of the ardfheis focus on the European elections where the party has the potential to claim a win.

Climate change is part of the first debate along with transport but there are no motions on climate change.

By the time party president Micheál Martin stands up to give his keynote speech, the highlight of the ardfheis, at least 1,500 party faithful are expected to be in place. The ardfheis sets the scene for the elections and Mr Martin is expected to rally members to support and canvass for their candidates including those at the local elections.

2024/4/13,"Simon Harris fears patent court referendum would be ‘rushed’ if held on June 7th Asked if hate speech law could be dropped like disability proposals, Taoiseach says Government ‘listening to the Irish people’ The Taoiseach has said preparations for a referendum seeking public approval to have Ireland sign-up to a unified patent court (UPC) with other European countries would be “rushed” if a vote were to take place alongside the local and European elections on June 7th. There are strong indications that the vote will be postponed with Simon Harris saying the Government would make a final decision next week on whether or not to hold it in less than three months’ time. Newly appointed Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke is to bring a proposal on the matter to the Cabinet meeting. The expected delay comes after referendums proposing constitutional changes around care and the family - supported by the Coalition, most Opposition parties and many civil society groups - were resoundingly defeated last month. Asked if those defeats was part of the consideration around the holding of the UPC vote, Mr Harris told reporters in Limerick on Friday night: “I do think it’s really important that Government listens and the Government learns lessons in relation to a referendum. I don’t think we should have any process that is rushed.” The UPC is designed to provide a one-stop shop for litigation on patents whose decisions will be binding on participating European Union member states. A Yes vote in a referendum would mean Irish patents would be valid in the 17 EU member states that have signed up to the UPC system. Ireland’s participation has long been called for by business groups and operators in sectors areas such as pharmaceutical trade. The legislation that would underpin Ireland joining the court is currently at committee stage in the Seanad. The Taoiseach added: “I know this is an issue that has been discussed for many years. But in terms of the actual timeframe to have a referendum campaign to allow the Electoral Commission do its job, I think it’s important that we reflect on that and get that right in terms of the timing. “And I do feel at the moment that it looks to me like it would be it would be rushed in terms of trying to have it on the seventh of June but that will be a matter for government to decide in the days ahead.” Mr Harris was also asked if the Government’s decision to drop a controversial green paper on disablity reform could open the door for other items on the agenda such as hate speech legislation to be set aside. The hate speech law has come in for criticism from inside Government and outside, with some Fine Gael TDs recently calling for it and proposals to extend opening hours for pubs and nightclubs to be scrapped. The Taoiseach said: “I hope what people are seeing from my recent appointment as Taoiseach and working closely with my ministerial colleagues is that we’re listening to the Irish people, whether that’s listening in relation to referenda and making sure there’s an appropriate amount of time for people to consider issues, whether it’s listening to disability groups who said ‘Hang on a second, we have real serious concerns’, and the leadership that my colleague Minister Heather Humphrey showed in taking that decision today,” Mr Harris said. “We’ve now set up a Cabinet Committee on disability I’ll personally chair that that will meet very shortly.”",0,1
2024/4/13,"Europe has ‘abandoned Palestine’ across political spectrum, FF MEP says Few countries have spoken out for Palestinian people, Billy Kelleher said, with action needed long before current tragedies Europe’s approach to Israel and Palestine has been “quite shameful” over recent years, Fianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher has said. Only a few countries and MEPs were speaking out for the Palestinian people, he told reporters at the party’s ardfheis. “The vast majority have abandoned Palestine, in my view, and that’s right across the entirety of the political spectrum”. The Hamas attack on October 7th that sparked the war in Gaza has given a “real urgency to do what we should have been doing for the last number of years way in advance of the tragedies that are unfolding before our eyes”, he said. Mr Kelleher, the party’s Ireland South MEP, visited the West Bank in 2018 and said Fianna Fáil co-sponsored the Occupied Territories Bill at the time. He said that what had to happen now was full recognition of Palestine as a state and a two-state solution as envisaged in the Oslo Accord, which should be implemented. Asked what they were doing as MEPs Dublin MEP Barry Andrews said that they had signed a letter requesting the review of the Israeli association agreements, which privileges Israel in terms of access to the European market, “a very favourable agreement for Israel”. They signed that last year and “we got signatures across the European Parliament”. He said he and Mr Kelleher “have been recognised as really speaking out for Unrwa, Palestinians and access to humanitarian aid”, when funding was being withdrawn over allegations that some personnel in Unrwa the UN humanitarian aid programme for Palestine, were members of Hamas. He said the controversy and Ireland’s support for Unrwa funding left Ireland very isolated. Now it was the mainstream view that the situation in Gaza cannot go on. “We need a ceasefire immediately. To think that we really had to argue for that back in October is really extraordinary, but I think we have a reasonable record to present to the people in that context.” Protests in solidarity with Gaza were scheduled to continue around Ireland on Saturday, with demonstrations outside the US and German embassies in Dublin along with other events planned for Cork, Belfast and many other towns. The Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis unanimously backed a motion that calls for a United Nations military protection force in Gaza, and to exclude both the Israeli army and Hamas from the territory. The motion, tabled by Cathal Brugha of the Dublin Rathdown Comhairle Dáil Ceanntar, also called for a similar action in Ukraine that would exclude Russian forces. Taoiseach Simon Harris said on Friday night that formal recognition of Palestine, announced last week by Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin, was coming closer. Speaking alongside Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez, he said: “When we move forward, we would like to do so with as many others as possible.” Mr Sánchez said Ireland, Spain and others would support recognition of Palestine as a state and its full membership of the United Nations. “We do this with two clear objectives. The first is to send a message of hope to the millions of Gazans and Palestinians who are suffering in the region. And secondly, to show the world that in Europe there are also countries willing to defend respect for the international order in all cases,” he said.",0,1

Arriving at the Fianna Fáil ardfheis where he was mobbed by wellwishers, Mr Ahern said he believed the Government would go its full term. Speaking to the media he said: “If it was my decision the election would be mid-June when it’s warm, it’s bright until 10.30 at night.

But responding to Mr Ahern’s comments, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien said the Tánaiste had been very clear on the election date. “We’ve a lot of work to do in the remaining 11 to 12 months of this Government and we’ll go to seek a renewed mandate early next year.” Minister for Finance Michael McGrath said “there is a certain attraction in canvassing on a day like today”. But he said that looking at his own portfolio “if we went to the country in June we wouldn’t have the Future Ireland Fund set up and we wouldn’t have the Infrastructural, Climate and Nature Fund set up and I don’t trust anybody else to do it quite frankly”. He added: “We have another budget to go and we can make a lot of progress in really important areas”. Mr Ahern also expressed good wishes for Taoiseach Simon Harris’s tenure in office. Asked if he thought Mr Harris at 37 was a bit young to be Taoiseach, he said he became taoiseach at 44. “I was young. Now they actually get younger all the time.” He said Mr Harris had a lot of experience. “He was in health, which is a hard ministry, for four years. He’s in third-level education. He’s been in finance. He was chairman of Wicklow Council. He might be 37 but he’s still put in a lot of years. So I wish him well. It’s hugely important for the country that he does well so I give him my very best.” Before his appointment as Taoiseach Mr Harris served as minister for further and higher education, and before his appointment as minister for health he served as minister of state for finance. Asked what top tip he would give the new Taoiseach, Mr Ahern said “I think it’s take a small number of issues and do the best you can on those issues. “If you try to take too many issues you get spread too thin. It’s very hard. There’s always the unpredictable. The one thing when you’re Taoiseach you get up in the morning and the day never runs as you think it will.” A number of former ministers from Mr Ahern’s cabinets were among those in attendance at the ardfheis, including former education ministers Noel Dempsey and Mary Hanafin. Ms Hanafin, currently a Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Councillor, will not be running for re-election. Former minister for defence Frank Fahey and former minister of state Tony Killeen were also at the ardfheis. Mr Ahern, who spent the morning out canvassing with Dublin local election candidate John Stevens, declined to set a target for the number of councillors Fianna Fáil could win at the election on June 7th. Asked if Fianna Fáil, which has 279 councillors, could maintain that number Mr Ahern said “Do you know what, I don’t even know what seats we had. There was a time I’d know every detail.” “All as I know is this is Saturday,” he quipped. He added that “from what I’ve seen they’re all out working hard and they’re doing their best and they’re trying to deal with the issues. And I think it’s very good reception as well. So it’s a long way to go, six weeks of hard work.” Mr Ahern also reiterated that he had not yet made up his mind whether to run for the presidency. The presidential election takes place in autumn 2025.",0,1
2024/4/13,"‘Get underage children off your apps’, Tánaiste warns social media giants Government will force internet companies if they do not do so voluntarily, Micheál Martin tells Fianna Fáil ardfheis Tánaiste Micheál Martin has issued a warning to social media giants to “get underage children off your apps” or the Government will force them to, in order to deal with the “new public health crisis of our time”. In his keynote address to the Fianna Fáil ardfheis Mr Martin also joined international appeals to Iran to step back from an escalation of the war in the Middle East. And he said that to address the impact of the global migration crisis Ireland needed to work with other European countries. The European Asylum and Migration Pact was an agreement to deliver a “firm but fair response to this profound challenge”. Mr Martin also insisted that “our support for the people of Ukraine must be resolute” against Russia’s relentless war. And he pledged that “we can and we will overcome” the biggest challenges facing the country, including building enough homes, providing for pensioners, protecting jobs, addressing the climate crisis and securing food production. More than 1,500 of the party faithful were in place for Mr Martin’s speech at the Dublin Royal Convention Centre, including a number of ambassadors. Iranian ambassador Masoud Eslami was invited to the ardfheis but Israeli ambassador Dana Erlich was not. The Tánaiste described as the “new public health crisis of our time, the impact on children of social media and being constantly online”. Parents and schools struggle to know what to do, and the Government has sent clear guidance to schools, he said. Similar guidance would be available to parents. He said a joint-initiative would be prepared by the Departments of Health and Education. “Every school will be given funding to support the banning of smartphone use during school time,” he added. “And to the social media companies our message is clear. Take concrete steps to get underage children off your apps or we will impose those steps on you. “Online safety – getting children off their screens and back talking to each other – these are objectives we should all share.” He added that free school books would be provided for all children up to Leaving Certificate level. Mr Martin, who is Minister for Foreign Affairs, condemned “the brutal savagery of Hamas on October 7th” and called for them to “release all hostages and stop their activities, which have brought great misery to the Palestinian people”. As he reiterated his plan to bring proposals to Government shortly on the recognition of the state of Palestine, he said Israel’s war in Gaza had caused an unjustifiable and shocking humanitarian catastrophe. “The evidence shows that war crimes have been committed and the bombardment of the population must be utterly condemned.” Calling for a permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostage and a mass humanitarian relief effort, he expressed concern at the “very worrying developments in tensions between Iran and Israel. “We join with others in appealing to Iran to step back from an escalation which threatens millions more people in the region with conflict,” he said. On migration he said action was needed to reduce numbers and speed up procedures. “That’s why we support the European Asylum and Migration Pact – an agreement to deliver a firm but fair response to this profound challenge.” And expressing Ireland’s “resolute” support for Ukraine, he said Russian president Vladimir Putin was “trying to crush the desire of a nation to have a free, peaceful, democratic and European future”. Mr Martin insisted that a “deep and positive engagement with Europe and the world is absolutely fundamental for Ireland’s future”. He also insisted that there are “real and growing differences between the parties”. In apparent reference to Sinn Féin he said “Fianna Fáil rejects the negative politics of those who claim Ireland has achieved nothing – those who oppose everything and offer empty promises.” His party believed in supporting enterprise, supporting trade and trade agreements and using economic success to support good pensions and social supports. “We believe in sustained action to build more homes and to make homes more affordable to buy and rent. We believe in helping to reduce costs faced by families. On the Northern Ireland peace process he said vital projects were being funded including the A5 to the northwest, developing the University of Ulster and building the Narrow-Water Bridge. “We are funding new research which is exploring both what unites us and where we differ on issues like taxation, health services and helping children to complete school.” “I know we can achieve a lasting reconciliation and unity, and this will always be our commitment.” As the party faces the local and European elections Mr Martin said they needed more MEPs like their two sitting MEPs Barry Andrews and Billy Kelleher, as the party runs six candidates in the June 7th election. And as Fianna Fáil attempts to hold on to its 279 local authority seats, Mr Martin said he wanted to thank the hundreds of candidates “for your commitment to public service – something our country needs as much as ever”.",0,1
2024/4/14,"Micheál Martin criticises ‘absurd’ claims by Israeli ambassador on Irish attitude to Hamas Republic supports two-state solution to legitimise aspirations of Palestinians, and has consistently condemned Hamas, says FF leader  Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has criticised as “absurd” assertions made by Israeli ambassador Dana Erlich regarding the State’s plans for recognising a Palestinian state. Writing in The Irish Times, Ms Erlich said that unilateral recognition of Palestine would send “a dangerous signal to Hamas and its supporters”, since it will be viewed as “rewarding terrorism”. Mr Martin, speaking on RTÉ radio’s News At One, described the claim as an “absurd assertion” and said Israel should respect the democratic views of other countries. “For a long, long time, everybody was on the one page in respect of a two-state solution,” he said. “So how is it in any way rewarding terrorism to say that we recognise a Palestinian state, particularly in the context of moving to a situation where we can get peace? The only way you have peace, I think, in the future, is co-existence between Israelis and a Palestinian state.” Ms Erlich claimed the Government had “scarcely condemned Hamas” or taken action against what she described as its “genocidal jihadi character”. Mr Martin also rejected this characterisation. “I took issue with that and I take serious issue with what the ambassador said there,” he said. “I will be responding to the ambassador because I have condemned Hamas, not just its attack on October 7th. We did resolutely on October 7th and sometimes the Israeli spokespeople try and call that into question. “There has been no question about unequivocal condemnation by the Irish Government on successive occasions in terms of Hamas as an organisation. The European Union has identified them as a terrorist organisation. And we’re members of the European Union. And the idea that we haven’t condemned Hamas – I mean, I’ve said it is jihadist and I said the attack on October 7th was jihadist in terms of the murder of civilians, the rape of civilians, and the killing of children.” Rejecting the suggestion that recognition would legitimise Hamas, he said a two-state solution was required and that moderation should be encouraged once a viable Palestinian state is recognised. “We’re legitimising the aspirations of Palestinians, across Gaza, Palestinians across the West Bank,” he said. Mr Martin also condemned the Iranian attack on Israel on Saturday night as a “flagrant abuse of international law”. He said a wider war in the region would be “ruinous and devastating” for civilians and urged restraint.",0,1
2024/4/14,"Fianna Fáil grassroots ‘optimistic’ about outdoing Sinn Féin in local elections Party members express views on targets, party leaders and potential coalition partners The upcoming local elections loomed large at the Fianna Fáil ardfheis, with a special “candidates’ corner”, reserved for seminars offering top tips as the party attempts to hold on to its 279 seats. Discussions included topics such as “Social Media for the Locals: The Final Push”, a canvassing workshop and a strategy session on “Engaging Local Media”. But can Fianna Fáil remain the party with the largest number of local authority seats? Leanne Mallon from Kildare South is campaigning for Cillian Keane, the youngest candidate in the Athenry/Oranmore electoral area. “I think that realistically we should aim for the 200 mark,” she said. The party is not doing well nationally in opinion polls “but I think a lot of our local candidates have a really strong local vote” and that could see them re-elected. I think Sinn Féin will continue to win some seats but if you look at Sinn Féin in Galway County Council they only have one seat in the Ballinasloe area whereas I would say they will look to gain maybe up to five seats.” John Morgan from Dublin Fingal and president of the Malahide Cricket Club believes “we’ll be lucky to get 240. I hope we hold the whole lot but if you’re going to lose some, you’re going to lose at least 10 per cent.” Sinn Féin did so badly in the 2019 elections — they lost 79, held 82 — that “naturally enough they are going to swallow up some seats”. But “they mightn’t do as well as they think. I think people are starting to ask some questions now” about Sinn Féin, particularly on housing. “If we could build 50,000 houses we’d have builders,” he says. “I mean who are they going to get to build them?” Brenda Clifford of Dublin West is more optimistic. “We will be aiming for the same if not more, always good to be motivated, always good to build up.” The former county councillor, who served Dublin West from 2004 and 2009,  said Sinn Féin is “the party that doesn’t seem to be able to make up its mind what it wants, what stance it’s actually taking. So I’m hoping people will be realistic and vote for the dependable party.” In Fianna Fáil there is a generally positive view towards Fine Gael and its new leader Simon Harris and the potential for an election pact. “I think Simon has wonderful energy, he has great ideas,” said Martina Kealy from Castleknock in Dublin West. “I’d love to see Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael get in again. I think it’s a question of trust and I think at the end of the day people do trust a large party like Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together.” She is also enthusiastic about her party leader. “Micheál Martin has always been a safe bet. He’s always been there. He’s very well-spoken, he’s extremely good at putting things into practice and he really does his best.” “Well I thought the leader of Fine Gael before that was pretty fantastic. I sat with him in the council in 2004,” said Ms Clifford of former taoiseach Leo Varadkar. A pact “might be a good idea but that depends on the two party leaders”. On potential coalition with Sinn Féin, Mr Morgan said: “I would say no, but the powers that be will probably say yes. I would be against it. I don’t trust them because of their history. I never liked the way they did things and I can’t just forget what they did up the North, it’s awful.” Ms Mallen said: “I think that Fianna Fáil want to be a party in power because a party in power can be a party for change and you have to be in government to implement change.” “From my perspective, absolutely not,” said Ms Clifford,",0,1
2024/4/14,"Fianna Fáil pledges welfare and pension increases in next budget Tánaiste also promises to ban children using smartphones during school hours Fianna Fáil has used its ardfheis weekend to make a series of pledges on tax reductions and welfare increases six months before budget day in October. In a series of speeches, briefings and interviews over the weekend, the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and his Ministers made clear they expected further tax cuts in this year’s budget as well as specific welfare increases of €10 to child benefit, €12 to the old age pension and potentially a further round of energy credits. The move is in stark contrast to last year, when Fianna Fáil was highly critical of pre-budget demands from Fine Gael for tax cuts and other budget measures. Mr Martin told his party’s ardfheis that tax changes would favour “families on low and average incomes” and that above-inflation increases to the old age pension would continue. But in a series of interviews over the weekend he went into greater detail, saying he wanted to see a €10 increase in child benefit, €12 increase in pensions and further energy supports. Asked about the budget plans on Sunday, Mr Martin told RTÉ Radio: “That’s something we’re going to push very strongly for and I believe that there will be receptive response to that.” Mr Martin also used his ardfheis speech to promise to a “joint initiative” by the Department of Health and the Department of Education to ban the use of smartphones by schoolchildren during school hours. “Clear, accessible guidance will be available to every parent on what to do concerning your child and the online world,” Mr Martin told delegates at the Fianna Fáil gathering in Dublin. “Every school will be given funding to support the banning of smartphone use during school time.” But sources in health and education said the plans were at an early stage. “The Tánaiste has laid out the intention and we will have to work our how to do it,” said one source. “A lot of it will be up to schools.” It is expected schools will be offered funding to supply pouches – already in use by some schools – in which pupils’ phones are locked away for the day and can only be opened by the school authorities. Sources with knowledge of the discussions, however, said it would be some time before the arrangements are in place, though some were optimistic the measure could be implemented in time for the new school year in September. All schools are currently advised to have acceptable use policies that set out rules over smartphone use. In practice, many either ban or restrict smartphones during school time due to the potential for disruption and distraction, unless they are needed for classroom purposes. At primary level, where smartphones are typically not permitted during the school day, the Department of Education has issued voluntary guidelines to support schools and parents’ associations to ban smartphones altogether. It follows an initiative in Greystones, Co Wicklow – home of both Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly and Taoiseach Simon Harris – where all eight primary schools and parents’ associations agreed to a “no smartphone voluntary code” until children start secondary school.",0,1
2024/4/14,"Fianna Fáil rolls dice in the budget flyer game at weekend ardfheis Leader and Minister for Finance trail raft of fiscal initiatives months in advance of what is likely to be a crucial general election budget    One of the familiar refrains for Fianna Fáil in recent years has been complaining about former Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar’s budget “flyers”. Last year, Fianna Fáilers were especially annoyed at what they saw as Varadkar’s attempt to bounce them into middle-class tax cuts in the budget for which he would then try to take credit. The trigger on that occasion was a newspaper article by three Ministers of State in May advocating tax cuts for the “squeezed middle”. Fianna Fáilers tut-tutted at this blatant attempt to roll the pitch for the budget to Fine Gael’s political advantage. Not helpful, they complained, for a budget that had to be agreed by three parties. Not collegiate. Not conducive to heathly Coalition relations. Not on. That was then, this is now. With a new Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach in place, Fianna Fáil has decided to take the initiative itself on the budget flyer issue, lest Simon Harris beat them to it. As the party gathered for its ardfheis in Dublin at the weekend, Tánaiste Micheál Martin outlined several budget priorities for his party six months before the budget is due. In his ardfheis speech to delegates, Martin avoided any specific commitments on tax and welfare. But in media interviews he was clear about what he would be seeking in the budget. He told the Business Post that tax credits could be increased, mirroring and surpassing last year’s level. “That would mean in effect that for every employee, pensioner, self-employed person, the first €20,000 of their income would be exempt from income tax,” he said. “That’s new, it’s something we’ve worked on as a party and it’s something we’ll be bringing to the table,” added Martin. In the Sunday Times, he declared his support for welfare increases, a €10 increase in child benefit, further cuts to childcare costs, further energy credit and a €12 increase in the old-age pension. Not to be outdone, Minister for Finance Michael McGrath was using the ardfheis weekend to assure workers he wanted them “to keep as much of their hard-earned money as possible”, in terms very similar to those used by the Tánaiste. So one of the messages of the ardfheis was: get ready for another big giveaway budget, with the Government parties jostling to claim credit for it. Fianna Fáil also defended the Government’s record on housing, echoing similar messages from the Fine Gael ardfheis last weekend and the week’s ceremonials at Leinster House. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael may get few votes from those who still feel locked out of the housing market but they reckon that 100,000 new homeowners since 2020 might have a more benign view of the Government’s performance. It is also noticeable that Fianna Fáil was talking about homeownership, rather than just housing. Martin also used his speech to announce an initiative on smartphone use in schools. “Every school will be given funding to support the banning of smartphone use during school time,” he said. “And to the social media companies, our message is clear — take concrete steps to get underage children off your apps or we will impose those steps on you.” But while work is apparently under way on a package of proposals, there is no sign of a clear commitment that students’ phones will be banned when the new school year gets under way in September. The appeal of such a move to parents would be immense. Martin’s announcement over the weekend – when he likened it to the smoking ban – means that if it happens, the credit will be his and his party’s. But if he doesn’t, it will be another unfulfilled promise. And with elections now dominating every aspect of politics, the stakes for success or failure of such initiatives are higher than ever.",0,1
2024/4/15,"Taoiseach says abortion legislation review requires ‘careful consideration’ Women’s doctors and human rights groups say women still being ‘forced to travel’ for abortions despite legislation Reviewing Ireland’s current abortion legislation requires “careful consideration”, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. Mr Harris said he was awaiting proposals from the Minister for Health and in his new role as Taoiseach didn’t intend to “wade straight in”. Speaking to reporters on Monday, the Fine Gael leader would not disclose whether he was in favour of scrapping the three-day waiting period for an abortion. In an open letter to the Taoiseach, a coalition of women’s doctors and human rights groups said women with crisis pregnancies were still being “forced to travel” for abortions abroad despite legislation being introduced here. They have called for “urgent action by Government” to ensure the recommendations in a report, published last year, by barrister Marie O’Shea – who reviewed the operation of the 2018 Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act – are implemented. The report recommended widespread changes, including the decriminalisation of doctors, the removal of the mandatory three-day waiting period to access termination medication, new guidelines on conscientious objection and the reconsideration of the rules around accessing an abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality. The Oireachtas Health Committee examined the proposed legislative changes and has produced its own report with recommendations. “In relation to the review of abortion services, of course I have personal views, but I’m not here personally, I’m here as the Taoiseach of a country of 5.3 million people,” Mr Harris said. “I want to await the views of the Minister for Health and his department when they come forward to Cabinet and I also want to try to approach this issue in terms of trying to respect the diversity of views and bring forward consensus insofar as possible.” Mr Harris said he was also very conscious that commitments made by politicians before the electorate mattered. “We had a very significant debate in this country, unlike other referenda, we published legislation. We told the Irish people if you vote yes, this is what it will mean,” he said. “Of course we also put in, and I was the minister who put this in the legislation, a review clause for this very reason so that people will continue to check their services [are] working as planned, you know, are things going as was intended. “I do think they need to be given consideration but that is the balance. The Irish people were given the assurance that if they vote for this, this is legislation you will get and then obviously there’s a review alongside that so I think this requires careful consideration.” RTÉ Investigates is due to air a programme on the State’s provision of abortion services on Monday evening. In an interview with the programme, Ms O’Shea has called on Government to prioritise ongoing issues with the legislation, saying vulnerable women who continue to be forced abroad for terminations were being treated like “criminals”. When questioned, Mr Harris said he would watch the programme and that “of course” he didn’t want women to feel like criminals. The Termination of Pregnancy Act, which came into effect on January 1st, 2019, provides abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks’ gestation, subject to a three-day waiting period. Terminations are also permitted after 12 weeks if there is a risk to the life or health of the mother or in cases where it is judged the foetus will die before, or within, 28 days of birth.",0,1
2024/4/15,"Fine Gael leadership asked to investigate ‘entirely irregular’ motion against ex-TD Senior party member indicated action and remedy to party leader in wake of no-confidence motion in former Waterford deputy John Deasy  A Fine Gael TD and party vice-president told then party leader Leo Varadkar the circumstances surrounding a motion of no-confidence in former Waterford deputy John Deasy five years ago should be investigated and, subject to the findings, the organisation should apologise to him, his staff and supporters. John Paul Phelan, a TD for Carlow-Kilkenny and a member of Fine Gael’s executive council, wrote to Mr Varadkar and John Carroll, party secretary general, last October describing the successful motion against Mr Deasy in June 2019 as “entirely irregular”. Mr Phelan said “approximately 20 to 25 emails and letters” alleging “bullying and intimidation” in Waterford that were sent to Mr Varadkar, Mr Carroll and Simon Coveney, when he was the deputy leader, had gone unanswered. “The idea that a cabal of disgruntled members can undermine an elected reps (sic) entire career and also bring reams of unfavourable local media coverage down on the party is unacceptable and frankly wildly outside the existing rules of the party,” noted Mr Phelan in the letter dated October 10th, 2023. A former junior minister at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, he said the next ardfheis needed to amend party rules governing motions of no-confidence in TDs, senators, MEPs and local councillors. The motion of no-confidence in Mr Deasy, who was a sitting TD and the government’s envoy to the US Congress at the time, was proposed by Eoin Coffey, a brother of then senator Paudie Coffey, at a meeting in Dungarvan in June 2019. There was no advance notice of the motion and some members complained that their objections to it were “shouted down”. Mr Deasy, who had informed Mr Varadkar the previous March that he would not be contesting the next general election in 2020, was not present. After the motion of no confidence in him was passed, Mr Deasy made a complaint of bullying to Fine Gael headquarters. In September 2019, then secretary general Tom Curran told a meeting in Dungarvan the allegations had been investigated and no evidence was found to support them. Seven members whose claims in writing were not responded to have withdrawn from active participation in the party. Waterford’s selection convention for Fine Gael’s next Dáil elections takes place tonight in the city’s Granville Hotel. The two candidates seeking selection are Senator John Cummins, who failed to take Mr Deasy’s seat in 2020, and Cllr Declan Doocey. The 2019 meeting had been called to discuss Fine Gael’s poor local election results in Waterford the previous month. Mr Phelan had been the national director of those elections. “I’ve nothing to say on the Waterford issue,” said Mr Phelan when contacted by The Irish Times. This month’s Fine Gael ardfheis approved a resolution tabled by the executive council to change the rules for motions of no confidence in its elected members, restricting them to “exceptional circumstances” and requiring “appropriate notice”. Under the new rules, only a constituency executive will be permitted to move such a motion. Asked if the rule-change arose from the motion relating to Mr Deasy, a Fine Gael spokesman replied: “Following the 2020 general election, there was a review of a number of meetings held in advance of the same election. It was established there were no procedures for dealing with motions of no confidence or similar tabled in public representatives. Subsequently, a motion was proposed at this month’s Fine Gael ardfheis and agreed by it that no-confidence motions could only be moved by a constituency executive and only in line with procedures set down by the Fine Gael executive council. “Those procedures shall have regard to the fact that such motions should only be moved in exceptional circumstances and shall set down, amongst other matters, the requirements in terms of moving such a motion, the threshold for the passage of such a motion [and] the appropriate notice.” Mr Deasy, who was a Waterford TD for 18 years, declined to comment.",0,1
2024/4/15,"Harris says people of his generation more familiar with Berlin and Paris than Derry and Belfast  Taoiseach tells British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly Ireland is facing period of ‘extraordinary geopolitical uncertainty’ Taoiseach Simon Harris has said people of his generation are more familiar with European capitals like Berlin and Paris than they are with Derry and Belfast. Speaking at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in his home constituency of Wicklow on Monday, he said “we really have to challenge ourselves” to build interpersonal relationships on the island. “Probably people of my generation are familiar now with London, and Berlin, and Paris than they might be with Belfast or Derry,” Mr Harris said. He pointed out that he was too young to vote in the referendum on the Belfast Agreement and that younger voters would not have been born when it was signed. The Taoiseach said that Britain and Ireland face a period of “extraordinary geopolitical uncertainty”. Speaking at the plenary session of the British Irish parliamentary association in Wicklow on Monday, Mr Harris referenced meetings he had held with European leaders last week following his election as Taoiseach. He said that paradoxically, it was “certain that in the coming years, we’re going to have to navigate the same geopolitical uncertainty whichever part of this island or these islands we live on”. Speaking against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Israeli onslaught in Gaza and heightened tensions between Jerusalem and Tehran, Mr Harris said: “The global context is more relevant to our relations than it has been in generations.” He said previous political generations had gifted the peace process to current leaders. “If we are to be self critical, we are yet to see the full benefits of it – we’ve seen the peace element, we are yet to see the prosperity element,” he told the meeting. The peace, he said, had been described to him as a “frosty” one which he said there was some truth to. “The challenge for all of us now is to warm things up,” he said, adding that he felt more hopeful and optimistic about relations on and between the islands since the restoration of the executive. Minister for Sport Thomas Byrne told the conference that tourism – the focus of the plenary session – is “deeply rooted in the fabric of Irish society” and one of the country’s most important indigenous sectors. However, he admitted there were concerns about a British plan to introduce a requirement for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for tourists visiting Northern Ireland from Ireland, which was raised by multiple speakers at the conference. The requirement is due to come in later this year, the conference was told, with those who transgress facing the possibility of fines and criminal sanctions. Responding to a question from the floor, he said: “This is a concern for the Irish Government” and that the Coalition and officials are continuing on the issue. Martin Fraser, the Irish ambassador in London, told the meeting that in a rapidly changing world, there was a risk that relationships could become “diluted” between the UK and Ireland as the forums they partake in as part of their international engagements were different. Offering the example of Ireland being in the EU and the UK being in Nato, he said that “some of our principle fora for international engagement are different”. Mr Fraser, who was formerly the secretary general to the Government before taking up his current role, remarked that generational change brought different perspectives and were sometimes “less worried” about historical issues in the relationship between Britain and Ireland and that it was incumbent on older generations to bring their experience to bear while also listening to younger voices. He said within British politics and public life, the group of people with direct experience of Northern Ireland was diminishing. He said migration was going to be a “massive challenge” that would only grow, later saying that the migration challenges of tomorrow would be totally different in scale. He argued that multiplying challenges also represented a “shared agenda”, saying he would struggle to think of any significant issue where Britain and Ireland would want different things. UK Ambassador to Ireland Paul Johnston said that the relationship between the governments had come “a long way” in the last couple of years with the agreement of the Windsor Framework and the resumption of the Northern Irish assembly. He said a call between the Taoiseach Simon Harris and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last Wednesday was “positive and substantial”. The UK ambassador drew attention to European security challenges in relation to Ukraine and the challenge of combating illegal immigration at source as areas for co-operation between Ireland, Britain and Europe.",0,1
2024/4/16,"‘Never been as much investment’ in cancer services, says Donnelly, as specialists call for more Open letter from clinicians warns target waiting times not being met and surgeries ‘frequently delayed’ due to staff and bed shortages Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said he would like more funding to go towards the National Cancer Strategy and will advocate for it in the next Budget. However, defending the Government’s record, he said there had “never been as much investment” in cancer services. He told reporters on Tuesday that it had to be ensured oncologists and cancer specialists had access to diagnostics, operating theatres and outpatient clinics at weekends. The Minister’s comments come after some of the country’s leading specialists warned target waiting times for cancer tests are not being met and surgeries are “frequently delayed” due to shortages in staffing, beds and theatre space. In an open letter to Taoiseach Simon Harris, the clinicians pointed out that dedicated funding for Ireland’s National Cancer Strategy had been delivered in only two of the last seven budgets. Mr Harris, who was minister for health when the 2017 strategy was published, has been urged to reverse what they describe as a decision to “provide no new recurrent funding” to the National Cancer Control Programme in 2024. Setting out various shortfalls, they point to insufficient investment in infrastructure despite rising cancer cases, and radiotherapy services operating “significantly below” capacity. Mr Donnelly said there had never been as much investment in cancer services and “we don’t unfortunately see those letters get written”. “The reality is, over three of the four years in Government, there’s been very substantial investment into the National Cancer Strategy. In fact, I funded them in the first two years to the tune of €14 million, they weren’t able to spend that money in the first two years and so that continued to roll on into the third year.” The Fianna Fáil TD later added that the National Cancer Strategy was an important funding stream and like doctors, he wanted “more funding in there”. “Obviously, that’s something I will advocate for going into the next budget for 2025,” he said. Mr Donnelly said it was important to recognise that “things are getting better for patients” and he would continue to strive to get urgent patients quick access to referral services. “I can understand frustration from surgeons when they are seeing surgeries pushed because of pressures from people coming in through the emergency department, unscheduled care,” he said. “One of the things we have to make sure we do is that we are using our operating theatres seven days a week, that we’re using them in the early mornings, that we’re using them in the evenings. “We need to make sure that our cancer healthcare professionals or oncologists have access to diagnostics at the weekends, have access to theatre at the weekends, have access to outpatient clinics at the weekends as well and that really is what the new public only consultant contract is about, moving from a scheduled nine to six Monday to Friday hospital service to seven days a week including mornings and evenings as well.” Separately, Mr Donnelly said it had to be ensured the State was “getting value for money” from public nursing homes and an audit into them was being conducted to see if there were cases whereby “staffing ratios could be looked at”. “When we see such a big disparity in the cost base between the private homes and the public homes, I think it’s important that we do an audit in order to see if there is money that can be saved,” he said. The Minister added that he wouldn’t make “any judgments” ahead of the audit and that the disparity between public and private nursing homes in terms of costs could be “completely legitimate”. “If it is [the case], it won’t be touched, but maybe we will be able to find areas where some of the public nursing homes for example, are doing better than some of the others and we can learn from them.”",0,1
2024/4/17,"Taoiseach leads tribute to ‘consummate political tactician’ Gerard Murphy, who died aged 73 Former Fine Gael TD for Cork North-West constituency was ‘dedicated public servant’, Simon Harris says Taoiseach Simon Harris has led the tributes to former Cork North West Fine Gael TD Gerard Murphy, who died on Monday aged 73, describing him as “a dedicated public servant”. Colleagues remembered Mr Murphy, a sitting councillor, as a “consummate political tactician” who was a key figure in Fine Gael’s successes in Cork North-West for over four decades. A native of Newmarket in North Cork, Mr Murphy, a postmaster, was elected as a TD for Cork North-West in 2002, taking the seat of his running mate, Michael Creed. He was a member of Cork County Council for almost three decades. He was noted as a political strategist and regarded as being key to Fine Gael taking and holding two seats in the three-seat constituency throughout the 1980s and 1990s and into the 2000s. Mr Harris expressed his condolences to Mr Murphy’s widow, Marian, his daughter Trish and son Donnacha. “Gerard was a dedicated public representative who loved his local areas of Kanturk and Newmarket, serving them with great loyalty, hard work, and distinction. Solving problems and finding solutions for the people he represented was at the heart of everything he did.” Mr Harris recalled how Mr Murphy was first elected to Cork County Council for the Kanturk Electoral Area in 1992 and subsequently to Dáil Éireann in 2002. Cork North-West TD Michael Creed said Mr Murphy had been a friend over many years and a key figure in the Fine Gael organisation in the constituency. “An architect of the many successes in Cork North-West, Gerard was a consummate political tactician. He was driven by the pursuit of progress for his constituents, both at a personal and community level, and leaves a legacy of achievement that is widely recognised,” Mr Creed said. The mayor of Cork County, Cllr Frank O’Flynn of Fianna Fáil, and council chief executive Valerie O’Sullivan issued a joint statement paying tribute to Mr Murphy. They said he was one of the longest-serving public representatives in Cork county and a lifelong community activist. “ “Cllr Murphy will be deeply missed by the Elected Members of Kanturk Mallow Municipal District and Cork County Council, the Executive and Staff of Cork County Council as well as all those who had the pleasure of collaborating with him,” they said.",0,1
2024/4/17,"Simon Harris to make his debut at European Council summit The meeting will be the Taoiseach’s chance to make a favourable first impression and build relationships with other EU leaders New Taoiseach Simon Harris will travel to Brussels on Wednesday afternoon for his first meeting of the European Council, the EU’s highest decision-making body. The Council comprises all the heads of EU member state governments and its decisions set the direction and substance of the EU’s policy, both internally and externally. And where its members cannot agree – as has been repeatedly the case on the Middle East in the past six months – that too is immediately visible. The group is convened by the President of European Council, currently the former Belgian prime minister Charles Michel. But really, the role is more that of a chairman than an executive role; while the leaders of the big member states and traditional “engines” of the EU in France and Germany play outsize roles on the body, so alliances of the smaller states can also wield significant influence. Harris will be familiar with meetings of the Council of Ministers – where all the health ministers, or all the transport ministers, or whatever, all gather to discuss matters of common interest and agree common measures where the EU treaties provide for it. But the European Council is a different beast. For one thing, its remit runs across the full gamut of governments’ activities. Just as Harris is now responsible for the Irish Government as a whole, so the European Council must decide policy in all those areas where the EU treaties give the bloc a role. But the European Council also runs differently to the Council of Ministers, where ministers are accompanied by senior officials and conclusions are typically agreed in advance. At the European Council, only the leaders are permitted in the room. Discussions can sometimes continue late into the night over dinner and sometimes well beyond that as they wrangle over the wording of conclusions. Essentially, they are trying to agree a common position that everyone can sign up to; sometimes that isn’t possible, and in those cases the failure is very evident. Every EU leader will have received a briefing on Ireland’s new leader from their embassies in Dublin, but this will be Harris’s chance to make a favourable first impression, and building relationships with other EU leaders will be an important part of his work in the coming days. He has, of course, met the Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez in Dublin last week, and a number of other PMs in Warsaw last week. But this is his debut on the big stage, and the others will be forming judgments about him from the get-go. The two-day summit will be overshadowed by events in the Middle East and in particular by the dangers of an escalation of hostilities between Iran and Israel. The situation in Gaza will also be discussed, but EU states remain starkly divided on the issue, with leaders at the last summit only able to agree on a call for “an immediate humanitarian pause leading to a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza” and “the unconditional release of all hostages and the provision of humanitarian assistance”. There is a clear division between the more pro-Israel states (Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and others) and the more pro-Palestinian lobby, which includes Ireland and Spain. Harris is likely to seek support for the initiative to recognise the State of Palestine, currently being discussed by several EU states, including Ireland. The leaders will also discuss the war in Ukraine, relations with Turkey, and the future of the EU single market, on which a new report has been drafted by Enrico Letta, the former Italian prime minister and president of the Jacques Delors Institute. The summit concludes on Thursday evening.",0,1
2024/4/17,"Driver test waiting times down to 10 weeks by mid-year, says Minister  Delays down from 30 weeks last August to 15 by end of March, Minister of State at the Department of Transport Jack Chambers tells Dáil   Waiting times for driving tests will be reduced to 10 weeks by the middle of the year according to the Road Safety Authority (RSA). Following controversy over chronic delays in waiting times, Minister of State Jack Chambers told the Dáil they had reduced from 30 weeks last August to 15 weeks by the end of March. The Minister was speaking during a wide-ranging debate on road safety in the wake of the rising death toll on the roads. Mr Chambers said that, as of Wednesday morning, there have been 63 fatalities on the roads this year, an increase of 14 on this time last year and it “puts us on course for more than 220 fatalities for the year in total”, compared to 188 deaths last year. Drink and drug driving are among the main causes of road deaths and the Minister said that in the first three months of this year, 2,588 drivers have already tested positive for at least one drug “with cannabis accounting for more than half of those positives and over 30 per cent found positive for cocaine”. He said the Road Traffic Bill, which he hoped the President would sign this week, introduces mandatory drug testing at the scene of a collision, on the same basis as alcohol testing, and he would commence this provision in the coming weeks. He said the RSA had informed him that since the appointment of an additional 75 driving testers, waiting times had steadily reduced and that a waiting time of 10 weeks “will be restored by the middle of the year”. “That will help address the wider backlog and ensure the resources are there to tackle the issue of multiple learner permits.” Labour TD Aodhán Ó Riordáin described the backlog in driving tests as “outrageous” and said that “more than 86,000 people are waiting to book or take a driving test, including 31,000 in Dublin”. This delay was encouraging people to drive illegally on learner permits and for young drivers to pick up general bad habits and he pointed to the figures that “up to 30,000 people on their third or subsequent provisional licence have never sat a driving test. In some cases, learners have been driving for 30 years without ever holding a full licence.” Green Party TD Marc Ó Cathasaigh said there was a lot of focus on drivers but many of the people who have died on Irish roads are pedestrians or cyclists and road safety should include all people. He also criticised the RSA for spending €240,000 last November on personal protective equipment for visibility. “I want to see the cost-benefit analysis on that type of expenditure” and the “underpinning research which shows that road safety is significantly improved in some meaningful way from that kind of investment”, he said. Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said the State should look at engaging with the insurance companies “on insisting on speed suppressors in cars driven by learner drivers and young people”.",0,1
2024/4/18,"Ireland seeking to abandon ‘triple lock’ restriction on troop deployment  ‘Absurd that Russia would effectively have veto’ on Irish peacekeeping deployments, Taoiseach says Taoiseach Simon Harris has reiterated the Government’s intention to abandon the “triple lock” under which Irish troops can only be committed abroad if there is a decision of the Government, a vote in the Dáil and a UN resolution. The Government has argued that the requirement for a UN resolution effectively gives the permanent members of the UN security council – the US, Russia, France, the UK and China – a veto over the deployment of Irish peacekeepers. Speaking in Brussels on the second day of the summit of EU leaders, Mr Harris said it was “absurd that Russia would effectively have a veto on where we can send peacekeeping troops”. He said that Tánaiste Micheál Martin intended to bring forward legislation to change the triple lock, adding, “I hope that’s something that can be done in the lifetime of this Government.” “That is not to say – and this is distorted time and time again at home – in any manner of means a move away from military neutrality, which Ireland is intends to absolutely keep,” he said. The summit has so far been dominated by international affairs with leaders discussing the Middle East and the increasingly gloomy situation in Ukraine. The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke to the leaders via video-link last light, repeating requests for further military aid. Mr Martin announced plans to scrap the triple lock in November. The Government also held a consultative forum on international security policy last year. Mr Martin said he wanted Ireland to be able to respond to crises without waiting for approval from the UN Security Council, which has not authorised a new peacekeeping mission since 2014. Under the Triple Lock system, 12 or more Defence Forces troops cannot be deployed on an active overseas mission without approval from the Dáil, the Government and authorisation from the UN.",0,1
2024/4/18,"Wars loom large over EU summit as Simon Harris makes Brussels debut as Taoiseach Gaza, Iran, Israel and Ukraine clear focus of European agenda along with reform of capital markets. Like young Lochinvar come out of the West, Simon Harris breezed into Brussels for his first EU summit as Taoiseach on Wednesday, the youngest member of Europe’s most exclusive club. Harris was one of three newbies at the summit; it was also the debut of the Portuguese prime minister, Luis Montenegro, and Bulgaria’s Dimitar Glavchev. At Europe’s top table, the dinner guests change regularly – the democratic facility to sack their leaders is one that the voters of Europe are fond of exercising. All the leaders know that, someday, their number will be up; nobody gets too comfortable. Their acquaintance is inevitably temporary. But there were welcomes, all the same, from around the room. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had – pictures from inside the council chamber showed – a warm continental kiss for Harris (though only a frosty-looking handshake from von der Leyenfor her compatriot, the German chancellor Olaf Scholz), as the Taoiseach buzzed around the room amid handshakes, nods and smiles. Asked by a reporter about his relative lack of experience at this level, Harris was having none of it: “Well I’ve been Taoiseach for just over a week, and it’s my second time in Brussels, I’ve had meetings with six European prime ministers, and I’ve met the three presidents of the European institutions. I’ve been a minister or minister of state for 10 years, I’ve sat around the Cabinet table for eight years, so I think I do bring a fair depth of governmental experience to this role. But of course, attending your first European Council meeting is a first – it has to be a first for everybody at some point.” Someone’s got their big boy pants on. Earlier, the leaders were received by the king of the Belgians at his palace, with Harris’s briefing notes (presumably) making clear that Phillipe is king of the Belgians, rather than king of Belgium. When the world was a simpler place, there were only a couple of summits a year. But as the scope and size of the EU has grown, so the number of summits has proliferated. Now there are four a year scheduled, one each in March, June, October and December, but in reality there can be twice as many, as events in an increasingly uncertain and threatening world demand discussion, decisions and co-ordination among the 27 leaders. We are not yet at the end of the fourth month of the year and this was the third summit. Good news for the hoteliers of Brussels and for cops looking for overtime. Bad for the leaders’ carbon footprints. Wars dominated the Wednesday night discussion. War in Gaza, possible war between Israel and Iran, war in Ukraine. Most of the time was spent talking about Ukraine – which dominates the thoughts of the central and eastern European countries in a way that is both understandable and yet entirely unappreciated in Ireland. There is a growing fear of a Ukrainian defeat, and a realisation that this would prompt another wave of refugees heading west in the EU. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the leaders via video-link, telling them what he needed: “Weapons for our soldiers. Shells for artillery. Vehicles. Drones. Everything that helps to hold the frontline.” On Gaza, Harris proclaimed himself pleased that the EU had unambiguously called for an “immediate ceasefire”, a strengthening of its position since last month. Though quite what they think this will achieve is not clear. On Thursday, attention moved to internal EU matters, and the perennial question of reforming the EU’s capital markets. The oversimplified version is about making the EU’s trillions of euro of savings work to create investment, jobs and growth. But Ireland and other countries are nervous about a French smash and grab on their financial services sectors, and there is also concern in Dublin about tax harmonisation elements to the plans. And so Harris in his first summit followed the path of several of his predecessors: defending the economic advantages of Europe’s most pro-EU country against EU plans which might threaten them. The next summit is in June – actually, there are two that month – when the EU’s leaders will turn to the great Brussels parlour game of who gets the EU’s top jobs for the next five years. Harris will not be in the reckoning. He has the job he wanted.",0,1
2024/4/2,"Simon Coveney: Cork merchant prince served long spell on political front line, from horse meat to Brexit Long-serving minister replaced his father in 1998 and has been a player in national picture for much of last 26 years Simon Coveney (51) has been at the front line of Irish politics for 26 years with half of that time spent at the Cabinet table. The Cork politician has confirmed he is not putting his name forward to stay in Cabinet ahead of new Fine Gael leader Simon Harris’s expected election as taoiseach next week. Insisting on Tuesday that he is “as energised by politics as I’ve always been” it remains to be seen if Coveney will seek re-election to the seat he first won in 1998 after the death of his father, Fine Gael TD Hugh Coveney. Simon Coveney has been re-elected every time the country went to the polls ever since. From Cork’s so-called ‘merchant class’, Coveney, a father of three, is a sailing and rugby fan. His only break from the Dáil was the three years he spent as an MEP between 2004 and 2007. In 2010 he backed Richard Bruton in the ill-fated heave against then party leader Enda Kenny. Despite this, Kenny appointed Coveney to Cabinet as minister for agriculture in 2011. The horse meat crisis of 2013 was an early test for the new minister. Coveney is seen as having steadied the ship during the food scandal that shook the industry. The defence brief was added to his responsibilities in 2014. His time at the department saw the deployment of Naval Service vessels to the Mediterranean to help rescue refugees making the dangerous crossing to Europe. He was appointed as minister for housing at the start of the Fine Gael led-minority government in 2016. Coveney launched his “Rebuilding Ireland” action plan and over-promised in a pledge to end the practice of homeless families being housed in hotels and B&Bs by the middle of 2017. This did not happen. He lost out to Leo Varadkar in the Fine Gael leadership contest in 2017, winning a majority of grassroots members but not enough crucial votes among TDs and senators who have more weight under Fine Gael’s system for electing a leader. Varadkar appointed him as Fine Gael deputy leader and minister for foreign affairs and Coveney also later assumed the role of tánaiste. He spearheaded Ireland’s successful bid to win a United Nations Security Council seat and has been widely praised for his stout defence of Ireland’s interests during Brexit. Coveney stayed in the foreign affairs brief at the start of the current Coalition. He blundered in a controversial attempt to appoint former minister Katherine Zappone as a special envoy to the UN. However, he recovered politically and was among the first foreign politicians to visit Ukraine after the Russian invasion. The December 2022 reshuffle saw Coveney moved to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Though there have been job losses in the tech industry during this time, Ireland is effectively in a period of full employment. Coveney told RTÉ radio on Tuesday: “I entered politics under a sort of a sad cloud in a byelection but since then I’ve never regretted entering politics. “It’s been a fascinating life for me, hugely rewarding.” He said he is “not going to rush” a decision on whether or not he will seek re-election in Cork Couth Central.",0,1
2024/4/21,"‘I think there’s actually a lot more of an appetite for Green politics than people let on’ Green Party members give their views on its chances in local, European elections and coalition after the next general election Anna Murphy joined the Green Party just two weeks ago because she is involved in the all-island campaign for the rights of nature which came out of the Citizens’ Assembly. From Galway, she is concerned that their message may not be getting across. “It’s difficult to know, especially where we’re from – it’s farming people who are already under a lot of pressure. “The whole idea around a just transition, it’s possible for farmers to start returning some of the land to nature and restoring it but they need support to do that because they’re already struggling trying to make a living as it is.” She says the Greens have a very strong message and farmers understand the need for a just transition but “I’m not sure it’s getting out there” and “I don’t think the farmers feel supported”. But in towns and cities it appears to be a different situation. Michael Kennedy is a local election candidate in Drogheda. “I think there’s actually a lot more of an appetite for Green politics than people maybe let on, particularly when it comes to social media.” People want a future for young people and families, and the Green Party is delivering improvement in their day-to-day lives and “people genuinely do see that”. He acknowledges concerns about immigration are among the difficult issues. “There’s been a deliberate attempt by far-right agitators to mainstream that and make it a more pressing topic for the parties. “But overall I’ve been quite proud that the Green Party hasn’t fallen into that trap and has made sure that it stands alongside and in solidarity with anyone seeking safety.” Andrew Holt, a student in Dublin Bay South believes that “in general the smaller parties are going to do better than the people expect and the larger parties are going to do worse than the people expect”. He believes party leader and Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan is “doing very well on a policy perspective. Things are improving so public transport fares got halved and there are cycle lanes coming in so I’m using those more now, it’s very good.” Dún Laoghaire constituency member Danielle Byrne is confident the party will do well in the local elections. “I think we’ll do better than the naysayers believe,” she says. We’re canvassing hard through Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock and Killiney Shankill. And we’re getting a very good reception on the doors.” Some people might say there is some negativity towards the party “but there is a lot of positivity and enough positive to carry us through the local elections”. And she’s confident the party will do well in the European elections as well. “We’d be very confident about Ciarán Cuffe. He’s a very good and communicative MEP, but I’m a townie and I wouldn’t know about outside Dublin.” Ms Murphy said “we really need Green people there if we want to change what’s happening to the planet with the drive towards growth and extractive industries”. She pointed to the shift to the right across the EU and despite all the hard work done on the nature restoration law “and it looked like it was going to win and then it was rowed back on”. Paola Serrano, a PhD student in sustainability and advocacy, who joined the party a year ago and got involved in University of Galway voter registration rallies “because the important thing is to boost participation. “This is the first election I am involved in, in Ireland but I’ve seen a rising concern with climate and sustainability and actions that we need to take to avoid climate disaster – more than we’re already in.” As for post general election possibilities “for a coalition with too many parties the Green Party will be the one upholding the climate. Other parties like Labour would put more emphasis on climate but a coalition with them may not be in the works currently.” Mr Holt said a Greens-Social Democrats coalition “is my preferred option, but that’s obviously not realistic. I guess Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil Greens, that could be realistic.” Ms Murphy said she would look at coalition through a rights of nature lens. “To be honest with the rights of nature Fianna Fáil came out quite strongly in support of it. And Sinn Féin. And Fine Gael seemed much more conservative on the idea of rights of nature, although there were some supporters amongst them as well.” Mr Kennedy is convinced the Green Party will be government contenders after the general election. And “there is definitely not going to be a wipeout of the Greens”. He would prefer a coalition with any party prepared to take climate seriously but he thinks only Labour and the Social Democrats do. “Realistically the bigger parties are not that active on climate but there is a space there in any coalition for the Green Party to make sure there is a serious change on climate issues.”",0,1
2024/4/21,"Eamon Ryan says Green Party’s job is to ‘hold the centre ground’ but space is getting tighter Party’s next election strategy boils down to assumption of more people being concerned about climate change that at the last one There was an air of optimism and high spirits aplenty around the RDS on Saturday as Green Party members gathered in the unexpected sunshine for their party’s annual convention. A few hundred delegates hooted and cheered their ministers and candidates with gusto, while the party leader Eamon Ryan defended  its record in Government and set out his tests for a future coalition. Considering that the polls suggest that party will be struggling to contain significant losses, this is a higher-than-usual level of political brio. It is founded on a sound assumption – that there will be more people concerned about climate change at the next election than there were at the last one. But it may not take sufficient account of the toll that being in Government will have on the Greens’ vote. Negative attitudes towards the party are certain to be stronger at the next election than they were at the last one. In particular, many independent TDs have made a brand out of demonising the Greens, especially in rural areas. Ryan himself has become a lightning rod for some of that sentiment. Polling averages have the Greens trundling along at about 4 per cent – well down from the 7 per cent the party won at the last general election in 2020 (6 per cent at the local elections a year earlier). And though big national opinion polls are not the best measure for small parties, which depend on exaggerated support for candidates in a limited number of constituencies where they are competitive,  they are a worry to party strategists, all the same. Every single one of the 12 seats that the party won at the last election could look vulnerable to a greater or lesser degree – even Ryan’s own seat in Dublin Bay South could be dicey if, as expected, Fine Gael wins back a seat in a constituency it would always have regarded as a banker and where it used to win two out of four. All small parties kind of live on the edge in Irish politics, but that sort of uncertainty must be wearying for those involved. And yet there was little sign of it getting them down at the weekend. Ryan was in ebullient form, greeting friends and supporters at the entrance, including some of the veterans of the last time the party was in government, when the financial crash saw  it lose every one of its seats. It was like the fall of Saigon, they joked. They can laugh about it now. Just about. But that experience is seared into the memory of everyone in the party. Avoiding a similar meltdown – and the consequent removal of environmental priorities from the business of government for a decade – is now the top priority. That will take more than just good intentions – it will take smart politics. Everyone in Government knows that relations between the three parties will come under strain as the election approaches. Ryan doesn’t shy away from it, scolding both his partners for their flurry of ardfheis promises in recent weeks. But he also identified with them, declaring the party’s task was to “hold the centre ground”. As left and right target him, will there be enough room for them all there?",0,1
2024/4/21,"Failings of original Stardust tribunal show need for reforms, Tánaiste says  ‘We’ve got to find better way to allow victims of tragedies to be prioritised in future inquiries,’ says Micheál Martin Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said he is in favour of overhauling the Tribunal and Commission of Investigation systems in Ireland in light of the way they failed victims of the Stardust fire tragedy. “We’ve got to find a better way to allow the victims of tragedies, and terrible situations like this, to come more to the fore and to be prioritised in terms of any future inquiries,” he said. “We know from other inquiries that they haven’t always managed to give solace to those for whom they were intended.” Mr Martin said that, in addition to a formal State apology to the families of the 48 young people who perished in the inferno in February 1981  there was a need to examine the way in which the State responds to such events. Referring to the Stardust Tribunal of Inquiry held in 1982, he said: “It was in no way satisfactory, in terms of its [findings] of arson. Although that was set aside in 2009, it caused enormous anxiety for the families of those who lost their lives. “It was problematic on other fronts as well. [Inquiries] leave a lot to be desired in terms of their adversarial nature. They sometimes don’t allow the full trauma experienced by the families of victims to come to the fore. And I think that’s something we have to seriously reflect on as a Government,” he said. Mr Martin was speaking in Arbour Hill at the conclusion of the Fianna Fáil annual commemoration of the 1916 Easter Rising. He said the culture and system in Ireland relating to inquiries was one where adversarial legal approaches tended to develop. He said that when designing the inquiries to respond to institutional abuse, the then government had hoped to “create a forum for survivors to simply tell the truth and tell the story about what happened to them”. “That didn’t materialise because of [the emergence of a] more legal framework. The law intervened, so to speak,” he said. The Cabinet will discuss at its meeting on Tuesday morning the nature and format of the formal State apology to the relatives, survivors and victims of the Stardust Tragedy. Taoiseach Simon Harris, who met the families on Saturday, will deliver the apology in the Dáil on Tuesday afternoon. Mr Martin on Sunday did not rule out additional measures including recompense. “I think we have to do what’s right by the families,” he said.",0,1
2024/4/22,"HSE chief executive warned of ‘grave consequences’ if senior official’s exit package was not approved Newly-released files reveal disagreement behind the scenes over package to Dean Sullivan  At the end of February the Government circulated a briefing note to Ministers who were scheduled to appear in public or do media interviews the following day. The Government had been tipped off by the HSE that The Irish Times was scheduled to reveal that one of the most senior executives in the health service was to receive a package of close to €400,000 on his departure under a deal formally approved a few days earlier. In the wake of the controversy over payments at RTÉ, the Government was aware the story could cause a storm. The note said the package given to Dean Sullivan, who had been appointed to the HSE six and a half years earlier, initially as deputy director general, was made up of two components: a legal settlement and a severance payment under the terms of rules in place for the public service. Both elements of the deal had received “all of the appropriate approvals in advance of the payments being made”, the note said. That was true. But newly-released official files show there had been a furious row behind the scenes before it was  ultimately sanctioned. Taoiseach Simon Harris repeated the lines in the briefing note when he appeared on Morning Ireland, on RTÉ Radio 1, on February 29th. Some Ministers, however, did not need the briefing material and were fully aware of the Sullivan deal and the row it had generated. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly and Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe had held talks on the issue. The top adviser to the then-taoiseach Leo Varadkar was also copied into some of the correspondence. The files say that Donohoe told Donnelly on January 19th that while he was eager to resolve the case, he was “at the limits of what he can agree to”. The HSE said that Sullivan had departed “by agreement and redundancy”. However, it has never provided any real explanation on the case, including how it came about or why there was a legal settlement. The HSE says it is bound by a confidentiality agreement. The files suggest there was a mediation process involving the HSE and Sullivan finalised around October last year. A proposed agreement was provided to the Department of Public Expenditure in early November, where it immediately set off alarm bells. Ultimately, it refused to sanction the initial HSE proposal. Subsequently, in a series of increasingly angry emails, HSE chief executive Bernard Gloster warned of “risks” and “grave consequences” if the deal negotiated with Sullivan was not approved. On January 18th he told the departments of Health and Public Expenditure: “Despite discussions inter-Ministerial, Department of An Taoiseach and inter-departmental all aimed at my accepting the unacceptable, I now find the further roadblocks emerging despite my having done so. “This has been an appalling process not the fault of the HSE and I will not under any circumstances accept further delaying and second guessing tactics. “I have been forced into a dreadful position and I will not be now compromised further. Thus far and no further.” The HSE has refused to elaborate on the “risks” it referred to in the correspondence. Government agencies can agree exit packages with senior staff. However, the Department of Public Expenditure believed that the HSE had not followed correct procedures. It said the HSE initial agreement appeared to have been reached without its prior consent. Perhaps more importantly for it, the Department of Public Expenditure said the original HSE agreement contained an ex gratia payment that exceeded the limit of three weeks’ salary per year of service set out under the official circular governing such exit packages. The overall payment initially proposed may have been close to the €388,983 ultimately paid out. However, the Department of Public Expenditure was determined to avoid a larger severance payment than provided for in the circular as this could set a precedent. On January 19th it told Gloster it could not approve a severance amount at the level originally proposed “given the precedent and risks it would pose for future public sector severance cases through its undermining of the limits in the circular”. It said it was only willing to consider agreement to the proposed overall level of payment in this case “due to the levels of legal and financial risk (as set out in the legal settlement form and legal advices) that the handling of all aspects of this case has opened the State up to”. The HSE ultimately agreed a revised formula that was formally approved by the Department of Public Expenditure on February 14th. Among the conditions were that in any “reallocation” of senior staff as part of new HSE structural reforms, it would have to come up with a “standardised approach in keeping with existing governance frameworks”. In addition, the HSE had to meet the cost of the payment from its existing resources. There would be no further money provided.",0,1
2024/4/22,"HSE attempts to pay substantial exit package to former top executive led to Government row Ministers and office of Taoiseach became involved in issue surrounding departure of ex-deputy director general, files show Attempts by the HSE to pay a substantial exit package to a former top executive earlier this year led to a furious row within Government. Official files show Ministers and the office of then taoiseach Leo Varadkar became involved in the issue surrounding the departure of former deputy director general Dean Sullivan – who ultimately received an overall deal worth nearly €389,000. The Department of Public Expenditure maintained it only considered agreeing to the overall scale of payment “due to the levels of legal and financial risk (as set out in the legal settlement form and legal advices) that the handing of all aspects of this case has opened the State up to”. It vetoed an initial HSE proposal – leading to a series of increasingly angry emails from its chief executive Bernard Gloster. On January 18th, he told officials in the Departments of Public Expenditure and Health: “Despite discussions inter-ministerial, Department of An Taoiseach and inter-departmental, all aimed at my accepting the unacceptable, I now find the further roadblocks emerging despite my having done so. “This has been an appalling process, not the fault of the HSE and I will not under any circumstances accept the second-guessing and delaying tactics. “I have been forced into a dreadful position and I will not be now compromised further. Thus far and no further.” On January 15th, Mr Gloster warned of “grave consequences” if the HSE proposal was not approved and he would transfer “all the associated risks” on this issue to Government departments. The Department of Public Expenditure argued the HSE had entered into mediation with Mr Sullivan before consulting it. It maintained the severance terms initially agreed were higher than those permitted under official rules and “would act as of precedent for future cases” both within the health service – particularly given the planned establishment of new regional structures – and across the public service. “This could lead to significant additional costs to the State for each case.” Mr Gloster said under the agreement he was obliged to keep its terms confidential but he was absolutely satisfied making the agreement was “the appropriate and proper course”.",0,1
2024/4/22,"Micheál Martin heading to Middle East amid ‘intensive efforts’ to tackle regional crisis  Tánaiste will meet ministers in Egypt and Jordan to discuss Israel-Hamas ceasefire, release of hostages and humanitarian aid for Gaza Tánaiste Micheál Martin will travel to Egypt and Jordan over the coming days as part of “intensive efforts” to address the crisis in the Middle East. Mr Martin, who is also the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will meet Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo and Jordanian deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ayman Safadi in Amman. He will also meet humanitarian partners at the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, and visit Unrwa (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency) programmes supporting Palestinian refugees in Jordan. Speaking in advance of the visit, Mr Martin said against a backdrop of increased regional instability, “we cannot lose sight of the urgency of addressing the current crisis in Gaza and the wider Israeli/Palestinian issue”. “My visit to Egypt and Jordan will focus on continuing my discussions with key partners on the need for an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages and full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza,” he said. “I will also focus on how Ireland can support regional efforts to return to a political pathway towards a sustainable and peaceful resolution of this conflict and a two-state solution.” The Tánaiste said the Government would continue discussions on how it and other “like-minded countries in Europe” could support the resolution of the conflict, including through the recognition of a Palestinian state and support for UN membership for Palestine. “It is vital that we use any political capital that we have to generate momentum for a comprehensive regional peace, along the lines envisaged by the Arab peace plan,” he said. “A two-state solution remains the only vision of the future that can ensure peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians.” The Fianna Fáil leader added the situation in Gaza remains “extremely grave” and that he would use his visit to the Rafah crossing to highlight the impact of “ongoing Israeli restrictions on humanitarian access”. “Up to 1.5 million people are sheltering in Rafah and the humanitarian consequences of any Israeli military operation in the area would be disastrous,” he added. “It is vital at such a moment of humanitarian need and regional instability to demonstrate clear and unwavering support for the work of Unrwa, which remains the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza and a pillar of regional stability.”",0,1
2024/4/23,"Government steps up crackdown on smoky fuels illegally imported from Northern Ireland Industry believes a third of solid fuel on sale could be smuggled over border as smoky coal ban extends across State New legislation to clamp down on smoky fuels being illegally imported into the State has been approved by the Government. New regulations introduced in late 2022 extend the smoky coal ban from Dublin and other larger population centres to the entire country. However, the new restrictions have led to a significant upsurge in the quantity of smoky fuel being illegally imported across the border from Northern Ireland. The industry body Solid Fuel Merchants Ireland believes that imported smoky fuels could make up to a third of solid fuels imported into Ireland, leading to a loss of €15 million in taxes per year to the Exchequer. At the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan was given approval to draft the Air Pollution Act (Amendment) Bill. The new Bill would give local authorities throughout the State greater powers to tackle any ongoing supply of unauthorised, smoky solid fuels being illegally placed on the Irish market. In the memo to Cabinet, Mr Ryan said that authorised retailers in the State were being undermined and undercut by operators selling illegal and polluting products, most often coming from outside the State. The Bill proposes an improved registration system for solid fuel providers. It will also include a better reporting system for illegal fuels, as well as increased controls in relation to the importation of fuels, including through direct selling, delivery or distance selling from another jurisdiction. It will also give powers to local authorities to identify those who are selling illegal fuel products online or through social media. The memo stated the new powers would help provide a more robust regulatory regime for ensuring all solid fuels on the market are in full compliance with the standard in the smoky fuel regulations. Anyone importing fuels into the State must register, even if they are based outside the jurisdiction. “This will protect those law-abiding fuel merchants who sell low-emission fuels from being unfairly undercut by rival firms who are breaking the regulations by, for instance, bringing smoky coal across the border,” it stated. The memo also referred to the fact that up to 1,300 deaths in the State each year are associated with air pollution. Smokey fuels in the atmosphere have been linked to increased risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and both chronic and acute respiratory diseases, including asthma. Solid fuel is cheaper in Northern Ireland because there is no carbon tax, a lower rate of VAT and there are no restrictions on the sale of smoky fuels.",0,1
2024/4/23,"Conflict in Gaza ‘not just a war on Hamas’, Tánaiste says on Middle East trip Micheál Martin says ‘population of Gaza are being collectively punished’ Standing at the Rafah border crossing on Tuesday evening, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said the continuing conflict in Gaza wasn’t “just a war on Hamas - the population of Gaza are being collectively punished”. “There is no other way of looking at this,” he told reporters. Having spoken with humanitarian aid workers and pointing to truckloads of aid being held up at the border, Mr Martin said he was informed that “ordinary” aid products such as green sleeping bags and tents were being refused into Gaza and there seemed to be “a deliberative policy of control” by Israel. He said this policy was to demonstrate to “the population at large who’s in charge”. Lotfy Gheith, operations director of Egyptian Red Crescent, later disclosed that generators, incubators for children, wheelchairs, power banks, toilets and oxygen were among aid products refused, along with chocolate croissants, which were deemed “a luxury item”. Mr Gheith said aid has to go through four checks by the authorities, with around 15 per cent of items rejected. Mr Martin is on a two-day visit to Egypt and Jordan, as part of “intensive efforts” to address the crisis in the Middle East. As the Fianna Fáil leader was being briefed by UN partners at the border, hundreds of Gazans were attempting to get back over the crossing, many of whom said they wished to be reunited with their family. Mwafaq Alkhatib (61) from Khan Yunis had a different reason. The manager of an orphanage, Mr Alkhatib had been trying for three weeks to get back to Gaza. Pointing to a bandage on his back, he said he had fallen over during a bombing, while adding that 200 children from the orphanage had been killed. Mona Barbakh (22), also from Khan Yunis, had visited the border 42 days in a row in order to try to get back to see her husband and father. She and her extended family had previously spent $15,000 to get out of Gaza. Mahran Omar held up his mobile phone, showing photographs of his six children who he wanted to return to. With around 200 to 300 people turning up to the border each day seeking to return to Gaza, small groups of evacuees could also be seen crossing over. Mr Martin later visited Al-Arish hospital, the closest such facility to the crossing, where he met Wafaa Qdaieh (1), who was recovering from gas inhalation. Ataaf Saleh, aged in her 50s and who was recovering after her house had been blown up, told the Tánaiste that Gaza needed a “solution” and that it was “uninhabitable”. Earlier, the Tánaiste sat down with Egypt’s foreign minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo. Following that meeting, Mr Martin said he believed there would be “much worse” found “buried under the rubble” in Gaza when conflict eventually concludes. He also said the world “cannot go on” with the type of warfare being seen. “There seems to be a new trend from Aleppo onwards where you just level the place, level residential houses, you level civic offices, you level universities, you level schools,” he said. “This has become the new norm in the waging of war. We see it in Syria, we see it in Ukraine, we see it in Gaza and the world has to call a halt, the world will not be able to sustain this.” Mr Shoukry described Ireland’s stance on the conflict as very noble and courageous. He said verbal calls and requests for a two-state solution were not enough and actions were required. Mr Martin thanked his Egyptian counterpart for facilitating the evacuation of 90 Irish citizens and their dependants, while added they were “anxious” to get another 40 or so dependants out of Gaza. The Tánaiste will meet the Jordanian deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ayma Safadi in Amman on Wednesday, as well as Unwra programmes supporting Palestinian refugees.",0,1
2024/4/23,"Plan for extra 1,000 student rooms to go before Cabinet Firing gun on budgetary process will also be started with economic update from Minister for Finance Michael McGrath An extra 1,000 student beds will be delivered across three universities as part of plans due to be approved by Cabinet on Tuesday. Minister for Higher Education Patrick O’Donovan will bring a memo to Cabinet detailing plans to ramp up student accommodation aided by what has been described as a “windfall” from the National Development Plan worth €100 million. Taoiseach Simon Harris has previously said he wants to address supply issues for students and remove barriers to education. Under the memo going to Cabinet, the Government will focus on adding 1,014 purpose-built student accommodation units across three universities. This includes 493 units in UCD, 405 in DCU and 116 in Maynooth University. A third of all the new accommodation will be for students availing of SUSI grants or for students from low-income families. It it understood that construction will start in DCU and Maynooth University this year, with work in UCD likely to start in early 2025. Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman is also expected to bring a memo to Cabinet which would fast track plans to recognise childminders so that they can register with Tusla, and avail of existing childminding subsidies. Childminders who are not registered with Tusla, the child and family agency, cannot be considered for the childcare scheme. There is no centralised registration system for childminders, who typically work in people’s homes, but it is estimated there are about 15,000 childminders in Ireland. A Government source said Mr O’Gorman may seek to expedite the specific part of the legislation which deals with the registration issue, rather than bringing the entirety of a Bill which addressed broader issues. Minister for Finance Michael McGrath will also bring the 2024 Stability Programme Update (SPU) which will detail the state of the economy. The publication of the SPU effectively fires the starting gun on the process for Budget 2025. After this, the National Economic Dialogue will hear from stakeholders and this will be followed by a Summer Economic Statement. An update on the Government’s Housing For All plan will also be brought by the Department of Taoiseach. It comes after Ministers were privately warned earlier this year that an extra 120,000 homes would likely be needed by 2030. Ministers were told at a Cabinet committee meeting that previous estimates which showed the population reaching 5.7 million people by 2040 may now materialise 10 years sooner than expected. They were told the Economic and Social Research Institute was now projecting in excess of 300,000 more people in 2030 than previously anticipated, and that this could equate to a requirement for about 120,000 new homes to 2030 alone.",0,1
2024/4/24,"Urgent need for international community to make clear ‘catastrophic’ Rafah assault cannot happen - Martin About 40 dependents of Irish citizens remain stuck in Gaza, Tánaiste says during trip to Jordan There is an “urgent need” for the international community to make it “clear” that an Israeli invasion of Rafah “cannot be countenanced”, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said. Speaking in Amman, Jordan, on Wednesday, Mr Martin said such an invasion would be “catastrophic” and Gaza would not be able to sustain it. Mr Martin, who is also the Minister for Foreign Affairs, completed a two-day trip to the Middle East this week where he met his counterparts in Cairo and Amman, and visited the Rafah border crossing. He said there are about 40 dependents of Irish citizens stuck in Gaza and that the Department of Foreign Affairs would continue to advocate on their behalf. Mr Martin said about 90 Irish citizens and their dependents had been facilitated to evacuate the region to date. “Some [dependents] have come later than the original numbers… some it seems are emerging through informal channels as well,” Mr Martin said. “Once that happens, we then facilitate their reintegration into Irish society.” The Fianna Fáil leader said that following his political engagements over recent days, he was “pessimistic” about the prospects of a ceasefire, which seemed to be going “backwards”. “I hope I’m wrong, that’s very bad news,” Mr Martin said. “I’m also worried about the prospects of an Israeli invasion of Rafah. We spoke to humanitarian workers there yesterday, in Rafah, and Gaza would not be able to sustain such an invasion. “The humanitarian agencies in Rafah will not be able to sustain an invasion and there’s an urgent need for the international community to make it very, very clear to Israel that an invasion cannot be countenanced.” The Tánaiste said he could not understand why Israel was not working with other countries to get more aid into Gaza “faster and at the volumes required”. Mr Martin said it was “unbelievable” that every consignment of aid had to go through numerous checks while describing the “unspeakable human suffering” of the people of Gaza. He also said United Nations workers had informed him during his visit to the Rafah border crossing that Gaza was “not a good place”, in particular for women at the moment. “There’s been a breakdown in law and order, understandably,” Mr Martin said. “There’s no cohesion and there’s a lot of violence and they’re very concerned about the plight of women in this war situation. “Apart altogether from the prospect of death from a bomb or shootings… there are wider issues that arise in conflict situations where women’s health, safety, security, bodily integrity are at risk, and we know that from conflict situations, that is a deep concern of theirs. “They also made the point to us that in terms of children, the psychosocial trauma is going to be an enormous issue after this, that they think children are going through extraordinary trauma in Gaza.”",0,1
2024/4/24,"Some charity draws not exempt from TV gambling ad rules after amendment is defeated Minister of State James Browne says most of Bill received strong cross-party support despite a tsunami of lobbying from gambling and horse industries.  An attempt by the Opposition to amend the Gambling Regulation Bill 2022 to exempt charity draws from a “watershed” TV advertising ban has been defeated in the Dáil after a protracted and heated debate. The Bill is the first comprehensive effort to regulate gambling in the history of the State and reached Report and Final Stage in the Dáil last night. Two amendments to exempt charities from strict advertising rules were defeated by 69 votes to 55 and by 68 votes to 66. While there has been strong cross-party support for the Bill, there have been some sections which have been strongly contested by Sinn Féin and some Independent TDs, not least what it has described as the “unintended consequences” of the Bill on the charity, sports and community sector. Minister of State for Justice, James Browne and the Sinn Féin spokesman on finance Pearse Doherty traded insults over these provisions in the Bill that restrict advertising for draws and lotteries run by charities and clubs. The legislation will allow draws by charitable and philanthropic organisations with prize money of €10,000 or less to be exempt from a ban on advertising from 5.30am until a watershed at 9pm. This provision was designed to prevent gambling companies from advertising at times when children were watching TV. Mr Doherty described the section, as it applied to charity and sports clubs, as “bonkers” and as a “problematic piece of legislation.” In turn, Mr Browne portrayed Sinn Féin’s amendment as a “wild west scenario”, exempting that sector from every single safeguard, including money laundering and child protection. Mr Doherty raised scenarios where GAA clubs and charities would be adversely affected when they offered prizes greater than €10,000. They would no longer be allowed advertise those draws until after the watershed of 9pm. Mr Doherty said that the Donegal Hospice had a draw advertised on Ocean FM that offered a prize of €20,000. He said that many GAA clubs offered cars and houses as prizes to raise funds for a good cause. He said they would no longer be able to do that. Mr Browne stood over his decision to impose a threshold of €10,000 saying that it applied only to advertising, not to the draws which could continue to offer prizes of greater value. He said what Sinn Féin was looking for was a complete exemption for this sector. “The effect of the amendments will be to remove all regulation insofar as it relates to to gambling from the sector. It would effectively result in a type of Wild West scenario where anyone could act as a charity without regulation, without limitation, or accountability. “As legislators we are obliged to ensure that proper controls are in place to protect the wonderful work carried out by the charities in this country. And to prevent those that would masquerade as genuine charities from damaging the entire sector. This is a hugely important factor and we would be remiss in our obligations if we did not do so,” he said. He said the watershed was recommended to protect children from the widespread proliferation of gambling advertising. Speaking earlier in the day, Mr Browne told The Irish Times that relatively few amendments have been made to the Bill despite a “tsunami” of lobbying from the gambling and horse racing industries.",0,1
2024/4/25,"Taoiseach announces €100m in funding to develop student accommodation The funds will be used to part-finance three projects and 1,000 beds  in UCD, DCU and Maynooth which will offer a proportion of beds at rents below market value The Government has committed to investing €100 million in developments that will deliver 1,000 student accommodation beds. The investment was announced by Taoiseach Simon Harris and Minister for Higher Education Patrick O’Donovan on Thursday. At a media conference outside Government Buildings, Mr Harris said it would allow 493 new beds to be developed in UCD, the progression of 405 new beds in DCU through tender stage and would help finance 116 new beds in Maynooth University to the construction stage. He confirmed that the State funding would be in return for 30 per cent of the newly-built beds being made available for use by students who are eligible for SUSI grants or belong to priority categories at a discounted rate of rent. “We must do everything we can to make college as affordable and as accessible as possible. No one should have to turn down a college place, or their dreams of pursuing higher education, because they can’t access an affordable bed,” said Mr Harris. He told the conference that construction would start on two of the projects in early 2025. “Any funding that we invest there’s a quid pro quo that ... a proportion of the beds needs to be at a fixed rate [of rent] and offered at below market rates,” he said. Mr O’Donovan said the long-term policy on student accommodation would include a focus on technological universities as part of balanced region approach to ensuring students had a place to stay while studying there. He also said the policy would also look at the possibilities of refurbishment and vacancy to deliver additional supply.",0,1
2024/4/25,"‘It is our land’: Palestinian children born in refugee camp abroad dream of return Third-generation refugees whose grandparents left Hebron remain ‘nostalgic’ for home “A human is always nostalgic for their homeland,” says 12-year-old Palestinian refugee Farah Hisham. Sitting beside four of her classmates at Talbieh Camp’s elementary and preparatory girl’s school, situated 35 kilometres south of Amman, Jordan they all say they would like to “go back” to Palestine one day. “It is our land,” says Majd Ahmad Abn Jarrar (12), also among the group of third-generation refugees whose ancestors were displaced more than 50 years ago. The five girls, all dressed in blue shirts and jeans as part of their school uniform, explain their grandparents were originally from Hebron, a Palestinian city in the southern West Bank, and often talk about their pastimes in Palestine and old traditions. Luna Khalil Ali (11) says they are aware of the situation currently unfolding in Gaza and “sympathise” and “pray” for the people there, and “help with donations whenever we can”. Majd adds: “We need to raise awareness of what is happening in Gaza. The world should know their story.” The Talbieh Camp was established in 1968 following the Arab-Israeli War, when some 5,000 Palestinians fled the West Bank and Gaza. The school was subsequently set up in 2017 and caters for 1,126 students, with 18 teachers and a counsellor available to support them. The children and their families live in concrete shelters beside the school. Talbieh Camp, which has a population of around 10,600, is among ten such camps run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa) in Jordan. According to Unrwa, there are about 170,000 ex-Gazans who cannot get citizenship in Jordan, with around 2.5 million refugees there. Several countries suspended financing of the Unrwa earlier this year after Israel accused a dozen employees of involvement in Hamas’s October 7th attack which saw 1,200 people killed and 253 abducted. Ireland did not suspend funding to the organisation. An independent panel, which released a report on Monday about Unrwa, said Israeli authorities had yet to provide proof of their claims that some UN staff were involved with terrorist organisations. Tamara Al Rifai, director of external relations and communications with Unrwa, said the impact of such allegations had been “very damaging” to the organisation financially and politically. She said while the report was “key” to countries changing their positions, its largest donor, the United States, has not resumed funding. Germany said on Wednesday it plans to resume co-operation with Unrwa, signalling a resumption of funding. “We are still not out of the woods,” Ms Al Rifai added. “We have enough funding until the end of June and we’re imploring governments and partners to continue funding.” She also said what had been seen in the current conflict was the “power of misinformation and disinformation”. “As Unrwa we have not only been very active in responding to the humanitarian situation in Gaza, we have also been very active in responding to claims and misinformation and at times outright lies against Unrwa,” she said. “It took allegations for 18 strong governments – partners of Unrwa – to stop their funding, if that becomes a tactic in all wars in the region, that really threatens the ability of the aid community all together, not just Unrwa, to respond to emergencies.” Ms Al Rifai was speaking as the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin continued his two-day visit of Egypt and Jordan on Wednesday, which included the camp’s girl school and medical centre. Dr Bilal Ashour from the centre, said many of the patients he came in contact with suffered skin diseases and respiratory problems due to the cramped conditions as well as mental health problems. Meanwhile, Mr Martin said he would be calling for a mechanism in the future whereby if there was a “shock or surprise announcement” or revelation in respect of “one specific aspect of Unrwa, in one place” that countries don’t do a sudden move to pause or review funding. “The value of me going to that school this morning and the medical clinic is, I go back to the European Union, to my colleagues and say ‘who in their right mind could take funding away from an organisation that provides such an opportunity for young people’,” he said. “To me, it is completely unacceptable to be undermining Unrwa.”",0,1
2024/4/25,"Churches asked to hand over building and land for asylum seekers under new plan Minister of State Joe O’Brien seeks help amid pressure to house 1,600 unaccommodated males The Government has written to church dioceses asking for them to make buildings or land available to help accommodate asylum seekers. In 2022 the Government sought church land to accommodate those fleeing the war in Ukraine and has now asked for assistance again to house asylum seekers amid ongoing pressure to house 1,600 unaccommodated single males. Joe O’Brien, Minister of State at the Department of Integration, wrote to the dioceses in early March, while also seeking more local authority lands or buildings from the County and City Management Association (CCMA). However, he was told that local authority’s ability to provide additional buildings was “severely limited”. Mr O’Brien said he was “disappointed with the response”, adding that the number of Ukrainians requiring so-called “rest centre” beds had dramatically decreased and that efforts should now be made to use any vacant beds to address the crisis in providing accommodation for asylum seekers. Mr O’Brien said that the CCMA had indicated that they will keep the situation under review, “so I would be hopeful that some capacity can be found”, he said. The Dublin Fingal TD recently called for a renewed push to find extra beds for those left sleeping on the streets, warning that they are being exposed to risk. Mr O’Brien first wrote to the CCMA last year and again in March, when he told the county managers that he was seeking “buildings that could be adapted for short-term emergency shelter or even an open space where we could erect a temporary shelter”. Earlier this week Mr O’Brien raised concerns that Government departments had not been pushed hard enough to find extra lands or buildings. He said that former taoiseach Leo Varadkar had not put enough pressure on them to find space. “Given the grave situation in terms of the number of people unaccommodated, many of whom are forced to sleep on the streets with all the obvious danger that entails, I feel it is incumbent on me to do everything within my power to try to assist the Trojan efforts of Minister [Roderic] O’Gorman and our officials within the Department of Integration. “On that basis I wrote to both the CCMA and each dioceses asking them to give serious consideration to their buildings and/or land portfolio with a view to trying to identify anything at all that might help alleviate the situation.” The Government is struggling to accommodate the number of migrants coming here seeking international protection, and has recently introduced a series of steps to speed up processing of international protection applicants, as well as limiting the accommodation provided to those fleeing the war in Ukraine.",0,1
2024/4/26,"Former Green Party candidate Saoirse McHugh to contest European elections as an Independent Climate activist standing as Independent in Midlands North West constituency Former Green Party election candidate Saoirse McHugh is to contest the European elections in the Midlands North West constituency as an Independent. Ms McHugh came to political prominence during the last European elections, where she finished sixth in the then four seat constituency. Despite previously having a very low national profile, she was seen as one of the standout performers during a campaign television debate, where she clashed with Independent candidate Peter Casey on the topic of immigration. The following year she stood for the Greens in the 2020 general election in the Mayo constituency, where she was knocked out after the fifth count. She also contested the Seanad elections later that year where she narrowly missed out on a seat. Ms McHugh quit the Green Party in 2020 after it decided to enter a coalition with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. At the time she said the programme for Government that had been negotiated and later backed by a majority of Green members was a “terrible document”. From Achill, Co Mayo, Ms McHugh submitted the necessary paperwork to stand as a candidate in the upcoming European Parliament elections in Midlands North West on Friday. Ms McHugh’s decision to enter the race will likely cleave votes from the Green Party candidate Senator Pauline O’Reilly. Other candidates running in the five-seat constituency include incumbent MEPs Luke Ming Flanagan, Fine Gael’s Maria Walsh and Sinn Féin’s Chris MacManus. Former jockey Nina Carberry is also on the ticket for Fine Gael, with Michelle Gildernew MP was chosen as Sinn Féin’s second candidate. Fianna Fáil is running three candidates in the constituency, Barry Cowen TD, Senator Lisa Chambers and Senator Niall Blaney. Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín TD is also on the ballot paper.

2024/4/26,"Do Peadar Tóibín and Aontú have their finger on the public pulse? The conservative one-TD party is riding high after being the only party to call for no-no votes in the family and care referendums so disastrously lost by the Government parties in March Despite Peadar Tóibín’s determined effort at party-building, there is a sense of personality cult in the room. Five years after he launched Aontú – and heading into his second campaign for local elections, falling on June 7th – Tóibín, the Meath West TD, stands to address a captive gathering of members and curious voters at a sports club in west Dublin. The best way to reach the backroom policymakers and disrupt establishment groupthink, he tells the crowd of about 50 at the Castleknock Lawn Tennis Club, is to get votes. “And that means bigger cumainn, more activists, more canvassing, more leafleting,” he says, beating the drum of grassroots machine-building. There are murmurs of agreement, clear deference to the party leader’s views on virtually anything. All eyes are firmly on him, less so the three local and European candidates surrounding the small function-room table. Tóibín is riding a wave in the aftermath of the disastrous Government referendums and the no-no votes he had endorsed. His was the only party to campaign for a no-no vote in the family and care referendums that were resoundingly beaten in a humiliating defeat for the Government Coalition of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Greens. In the weeks since, his party claims to have attracted about 400 new members, almost a quarter of its total. “They are looking for an alternative and somebody who is decent and honest. Who doesn’t get into politics just to get attention,” says Anne O’Connell, party member and a one-time Fine Gael voter. “The referendum[s] really proved that to us... he was the only one who stood against it. And good always wins out in the end.” Tóibín, a former Sinn Féin TD, is confident his brand of politics, the bedrock of Aontú, will have had enough time since the party’s formation to define and familiarise local candidates, attracting more votes and winning seats. “It may seem to [those] outside that this is a slim organisation hanging on the shoulders of Peadar Tóibín,” he told The Irish Times ahead of his party’s ardfheis in Maynooth on Saturday. “[But] I think people will soon find out in actual reality that we have built a significant depth of competency and capacity within the organisation to go further, to win seats.” Aontú was born of the 2018 abortion referendum that cleaved Tóibín from Sinn Féin. He had been a high-profile TD within the party, displaying the same conviction and oratory skills that seems to capture his audience in Castleknock on Tuesday night. In early 2019 the party unveiled some 65 candidates, about the same number it is running the upcoming elections. Now, though, it hopes it has firmer roots in a community weary of Government approaches to various issues such as the management of the Covid-19 pandemic, the abortion referendum, housing, immigration, EU relations and the debate – or lack thereof, as Aontú would argue – around gender identity. Aontú frames itself as presenting a “common sense” approach to issues, a way of bursting the establishment “bubble” that has come to dominate Government and civil society (NGO) policy-thinking, as well as the media. “It’s taken me a while to decide for myself what the appeal is. But, for sure, it is because he listens, and it is because there is dialogue and it is because we can talk [about issues],” says Kathleen Henderson, a former Fianna Fáil supporter, at Tuesday’s meeting, one of three Tóibín is attending every week around the country. Like others at the meeting, Henderson responds to questions on her party with answers about her party leader. “Peadar was with Sinn Féin... The polls will say Sinn Féin is popular. But [for] the people on the ground and people having discussions at the supermarket [and] the Chinese takeaway, they’re not popular,” said one attendee at Tuesday’s meeting who asked not to be named. “People are just not interested in empty promises any more; they actually want a problem solved.” Tóibín’s candidates present themselves as average community members, activists in tune with things. At the tennis club, Gerard Sheehan, the candidate for the Ongar area in the elections to Fingal County Council, draws playful boos and enthusiastic applause with a pre-crafted soundbite swipe at the Green Party. “I have planted more trees than any of them,” he said. “But the Green Party are worried about the end of the world; I am worried about the end of the month.” When it comes to his turn, Tóibín talks for 38 minutes, firing salvos at Government policy and establishment-thinking. A flurry of statistics – Aontú promotes a research-led policy approach – helps drive home his critiques of the M50 toll system, ambulances “snarled up” at emergency departments and boarded-up council homes among a long list of gripes. Irish Times polling last February found housing and immigration to be the chief issues attracting public attention. Aontú's party support was unchanged at 1 per cent, demonstrating just how far it must travel to grow in electoral terms. The party has just four elected representatives, including Tóibín; the other three are councillors in Wexford, Cavan and Meath. Tóibín avoids predicting how many seats the party will win in the June local and European elections, but he said the party should compete strongly in about two dozen council areas and one European constituency – Midlands North West – where he is running for one of four seats. Can Tóibín’s appeal – or the appeal of Ireland’s self-professed “fastest growing political movement” – push the number of the party’s elected representatives out of low single digits at the ballots in June? “Well, we don’t know is the answer,” says Kathleen Henderson of Tóibín’s ability to increase the party’s popularity. “But you know what my opinion is about backing the right horse? There is no other horse in the race. What other horse have I got?”",0,1
2024/4/27,"Aontú calls for ‘Irish Sea border in terms of people’ to ensure stricter immigration checks in Northern Ireland  Party leader Peadar Tóibín says a new ‘international city’ should be built in Ireland at ardfheis in Maynooth Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín has called for an “Irish Sea border in terms of people” which would see asylum seekers who arrive into Northern Ireland subjected to the same passport controls as Irish airports and ports. Mr Tóibín said a speedier and more efficient system was needed to “differentiate between those who need help, and those who don’t,” after it emerged that more than 80 per cent of people applying for asylum in Ireland are coming from the UK over the land Border with Northern Ireland. Speaking at the Aontú Ardfheis in Maynooth, Mr Tóibín said his party wants to see a “respectful debate” on migration and warned that there are “bad actors” around the country who are “seeking to foment trouble” and “harvest discontent” on the issue. “We are the party that has flagged the issue of immigration in the Dáil before. We want a respectful debate, one of compassion but also one of common sense,” Mr Tóibín said. “We believe the Government’s approach so far hasn’t had that common sense element to it at all. Shockingly, we’re seeing around the country at the moment a number of bad actors, I believe, seeking to foment trouble, seeking to harvest the discontent that exists within the State. “I would urge people to make sure that they do not get involved in any of those actions, to only act peacefully and democratically in the future.” “But we also need the Government to make sure that they focus on how migration is happening,” he said, referencing that 80 per cent of people applying for asylum in Ireland are coming through Northern Ireland. He said the only solution to the cross-Border immigration issue is to create “a system which differentiates between those who need help, and those who don’t, that does it in a speedy and efficient time”. “We have had a situation where we have an Irish Sea border for sausages in this country at the moment. The DUP did not like that, but they were forced to accept it by the European Union, Britain and the southern Government,” Mr Tóibín said. “We need an Irish sea border in terms of people as well in this country. We need a situation where the island of Ireland is seen as one unit in terms of being able to deal with this issue.” Asked how this would work in a practical sense, Mr Tóibín said it would mean “that people coming on to the island of Ireland have the same passport controls as a person coming through Dublin, Shannon or Knock at the moment.” “That’s the only practical solution to it. And if you ask me actually, I’d say that we would find friendly ears in London in terms of that solution too because the whole of the western world is dealing with this issue,” Mr Tóibín said. He also voiced opposition to the proposed EU migration pact, which envisages faster processing times and would require countries to either relocate a certain number of asylum seekers, make a financial contribution or send resources to other countries. “We need to keep our own sovereignty on this issue. There’s a big movement by the Government to cede sovereignty to the European Union in terms of the European migration pact. We believe that’s a mistake. Nobody knows what the cost of this is going to be into the future,” Mr Tóibín said. “If we cede this to the European Union, they will make decisions not on the basis of our need, but on the basis of their need as well.” Mr Tóibín said that his party now has more than 2,000 members, and saw an increase after the recent family and care referendums. Aontú campaigned for a No vote on both questions. The public voted resoundingly to reject both Government proposals. Aontú has selected 63 local and European election candidates and believes it will be competitive in at least two dozen constituencies. “There’s no doubt that we’re in with a shout for at least one if not more European seats, which is an incredible thing. And if you look at the polls at the moment, the Red C poll last month, indicated that we were about 5 per cent in the polls ahead of People before Profit, the Green [Party] and the Labour Party,” he said. “It’s incredible. They have about 183 years between them, we’ve only five. They have millions of years of State funding between them, we have zero.” He said the ardfheis would focus on “bread and butter” issues such as the cost-of-living and housing crisis. In his leader’s speech, Mr Tóibín also called for a new “international city” to be built in Ireland. He said that Ireland is “developing a lopsided city state. Incredibly workers are commuting from Ulster, Connacht and Munster to Dublin. Dublin is overheating. A third of the country is living in a commuter hell, with families travelling up to three hours a day to and from work. And a third of the country is emptying of its young people.” “Aontú wants to see a new international city built in another location in Ireland. This city may be an existing town or city on the south, west or north west coast of Ireland. We want to front-load investment and infrastructure into that new city so that it grows to a critical mass and starts to draw down international investment in its own right. We want to see it grow to a critical mass that it comes a counter balance to Dublin in terms of spatial growth.”",0,1
2024/4/27,"Aontú may be ‘listening’ but party is squeezed on all sides  Party leader Peadar Tóibín calls at ardfheis for Irish Sea border which would impose passport controls on asylum seekers arriving into Northern Ireland  There are two narratives about the future of the Aontú party. The first is that support is quickly building across the country, with the number of new members turbocharged by Aontú being on the right side of the pitch for the family and care referendums. The second is that Aontú has struggled to make a national breakthrough and will continue to be squeezed on all sides, having, as it does, positions that lean both left and right. Both are true. In the most recent Irish Times/Ipsos poll in February, Aontú was registering support levels of just 1 per cent. The poll was taken before those referendums, however, and party leader Peadar Tóibín will likely take more heart in a recent Sunday Independent/Ireland Thinks poll which put support closer to 4 per cent. Tóibín, who campaigned loudly and successfully for a No No vote in the referendums, says an extra 400 members came his way in the aftermath of those results, bringing total membership to about 2,000. At Aontú's ardfheis in Maynooth on Saturday, delegates gave passionate speeches about the state of the health service, the housing crisis and the cost-of-living crisis with the focus of the gathering being very much about “bread-and-butter issues”. Dotted out on tables in the Glenroyal Hotel were leaflets decrying “abortion on demand” which claimed that the Government has been “seeking to normalise abortion throughout Irish society”. On the walls were posters declaring that Aontú is the party of “common sense” as motions were tabled opposing the controversial hate speech legislation and assisted dying. And during a press conference, Tóibín once again called for a more controlled immigration system. He said there should be an “Irish Sea border in terms of people” which would see asylum seekers who arrive into Northern Ireland subjected to the same passport controls as Irish airports and ports. His comments are topical, as it emerged last week that more than 80 per cent of people applying for asylum in Ireland are coming from the UK over the land Border with Northern Ireland. On the other hand, Tóibín decried “bad actors” around the country who he believes are seeking to stir up trouble and “harvest the discontent that exists within the State”. “I would urge people to make sure that they do not get involved in any of those actions, to only act peacefully and democratically in the future.” On local radio on Friday, Tóibín also hit out at what he described as a growing trend of “ethnonationalism” following clashes between gardaí and protesters in Newtownmountkennedy. The comments were picked up on social media platforms by some on the far right who appear annoyed that, in the words of one individual, Tóibín was “punching right”. It’s not the first time in recent months that Aontú has been targeted by elements of the far right. Newly announced local election candidates such as Fayiz Alsani, Tinko Tinev and Jose Syriac were recently subjected to online abuse after Aontú declared their candidacy. In some instances, Aontú has disabled online comments on posts about these new candidates, with the party keen to distance itself entirely from racism of any kind. On Saturday, Aontú was calling for an immigration policy which contains “compassion and common sense” and which opposes “discrimination against any citizen on the basis of the colour of their skin”. A motion from the party’s ard comhairle also called for a “stricter immigration policy that is sustainable” with processing times reduced to a maximum of four months. In truth, Aontú's position on immigration is not a million miles from that of the Government, which has recently vowed to enforce deportations and tighten up rules, although Aontú differs in not supporting the European Union migration pact. Aontú has called for a greater level of public consultation: Taoiseach Simon Harris recently agreed that the Government shouldn’t be “rocking up” and taking a community’s last hotel out of circulation. Harris said a more proactive policy was needed. Aontú has called for a community dividend for those taking in high numbers: the Government has established a community recognition fund. Aontú has said the asylum application process is shockingly slow: the Government appears to agree by virtue of recent announcements to introduce faster processing times. Ultimately, the party’s position on immigration is unlikely to win it huge swathes of extra votes in the coming months. Those motivated to vote against the Government because of immigration may find themselves drifting towards Independent candidates. In the coming weeks ahead of polling day, Aontú will instead heavily capitalise on the referendum results and will present itself as a party that is “actually listening to people”, as Tóibín says. It will also present itself as opposing the Government but also sometimes the rest of the Opposition as well. It will take swipes at other smaller parties such as the Green Party. This weekend Tóibín said that while the Green Party is worrying about the end of the world, most people are worrying about getting paid at the end of the month. In reality, plenty of people worry about both. Aontú is campaigning against carbon tax: firm Sinn Féin territory. The message from Aontú will be that “we are the party of common sense”. The problem is that common sense means different things to different people.",0,1
2024/4/27,"First shots fired in the Government’s budget battles With spending promises already flooding in, expect another bazooka budget this year as the Coalition gears up for a general election Long before the two budget ministers present their package in October, ministers, TDs, lobby groups and supplicants of all hues spend hours in rooms with large tables wrangling and rowing over budget measures, allocations, tax cuts, and the rest. The venues and the personnel change, but the line-up is essentially always the same: the Department of Public Expenditure and/or the Department of Finance are on one side, trying to keep a lid on spending increases and budget giveaways, and everyone else is on the other, looking for more money. It has started early this year, for the last budget of the Coalition before the general election. Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael used their recent ardfheiseanna to propose a series of tax cuts and spending increases, each apparently trying to get ahead of the other. Simon Harris was not yet in the door of the Taoiseach’s office when he promised his ardfheis that there would be help for businesses and farmers, tax cuts for middle income earners, cuts to the universal social charge (USC) – the post-crash income tax that replaced the income and health levies in 2011 – and 250,000 new homes by 2030. A week later, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin was more specific, telling his party’s ardfheis that he would be “pushing very strongly” for a €10 increase to child benefit in the budget. Anything else? Well, a €12 per week increase for pensioners, maybe; more energy credits; free schoolbooks; further childcare subsidies; increased tax credits for renters, and cuts to the USC. The Government, however, would be cautious, Martin and his colleagues insisted. “I don’t think big bazooka budgets work in elections,” the Fianna Fáil leader told RTÉ. Medium-sized bazookas, though, that’s a different matter. Despite what you might be inclined to think listening to 90 per cent of political debates, however, the Government – while certainly in an extraordinarily fortuitous fiscal position – does not have unlimited financial resources. As Cliff Taylor pointed out in his Smart Money column this week, the shortly-to-be-legal obligation on the Government to put €6 billion into its long-term savings funds means the budgetary arithmetic is a lot tighter than it looks. This week, the two budget ministers – Minister for Finance Michael McGrath and Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe – made their first public attempt (there will be many private ones) to limit the demands for extra spending that will inevitably pepper the government’s public and private discussions over the coming months. They published the Stability Programme Update (SPU) – a document detailing the current fiscal position and expectations that forms the first concrete step in the process that will lead to the Coalition’s final, pre-election, budget in October. In recent years, there is always a game afoot here. The Department of Finance tries to warn about risks, about the potential unreliability of corporation tax revenues and the dangers of building enduring spending commitments on the back of transient revenues. In fairness, this is a real concern. The problem for the finance hawks of late is that by the end of the year, corporation tax revenues have invariably beaten expectations. And even if there are (again) recent signs that the great gushing geyser of money might be easing off, there is a sense among many ministers that the Department of Finance is like the boy who cried wolf. The point of that story, though, is that the wolf turned up in the end. Ministers will continue to press for more spending in their departments. The McGrath-Donohoe axis of prudence (as they would have it) will continue to resist what they see as excessive demands. So where will we end up in October? The SPU suggests that without policy changes the Government will run a surplus of nearly €10 billion this year. That indicates there will be scope for a substantial giveaway budget in advance of the autumn. Could it be as big as last year’s €11 billion budget day giveaway, which included one-off measures, as well as tax cuts and permanent spending increases, again this year? “Absolutely,” says University of Limerick Professor of Economics Stephen Kinsella. “They’ve got something like €26 billion to €30 billion in cash. They’re incredibly liquid at the moment.” A budget of at least as great a magnitude as last year is certainly the expectation across the Government. Kinsella adds, as an afterthought: “Though it was incredibly liquid in 2006, if you recall.” This is the fear that haunts the Departments of Public Expenditure and Finance: that they will repeat the mistakes of the past and build up big spending commitments that the country will not be able to afford in the event of a downturn. That’s one of the reasons why the Government adopted, early in its term, a rule that it would not increase spending by more than 5 per cent (calculated by long-term trend growth plus inflation) a year. In theory, this was an example of a government agreeing to tie its own hands to prevent itself succumbing to short-term political pressures – a classic act of good long-term governance. In practice, it has proved impossible to adhere to: the rule has been broken every year. This week, neither Donohoe nor McGrath was willing to commit to keeping the 5 per cent rule this year either. At this stage, it might be more accurate to describe the effective rule as spending must increase by “at least” 5 per cent a year. Or maybe, more fairly, the real rule is: don’t go too far above 5 per cent. In a note circulated to investors in response to the SPU this week, Goodbody Stockbrokers chief economist Dermot O’Leary noted the emerging spending pressures and pointed to the importance of the rules. “We note also the calls for further fiscal measures following the appointment of the new Taoiseach and in advance of the next General Election likely to be held in March 2025,” the Goodbody note said. “It is important that [the Government] adheres to its own rules (such as the 5 per cent spending growth rule). There has been slippage on this in recent years.” “Irish fiscal policy tends to be pro-cyclical,” O’Leary later told The Irish Times, “and that increases coming towards an election.” Several sources involved in the process stressed that the two budget ministers had gained significant experience in recent years resisting spending demands and delivering a sustainable fiscal policy. Though they admitted that the political reality meant there would be an election budget. “There will be a long-term plan to keep the public finances in good shape,” said one person closely involved in the budgetary process. “And a short-term plan to win the election.”",0,1
2024/4/29,"Poll analysis: Housing and immigration are making the headlines, but other topics are becoming more prominent After peaking at 24% in January, mentions of immigration have declined month-on-month, falling to 12% in the latest poll Housing remains the issue that preoccupies the Irish public, according to the latest Ipsos B & Snapshot poll for The Irish Times. When participants in the April poll were asked what was the one thing they had seen or heard from Government recently that suggested the country is going in the right or wrong direction, 21 per cent gave housing their first mention, making it the most salient issue by a considerable margin. Each Snapshot poll is conducted among a random national sample of 1,000 Irish adults aged 15 years and upwards. Housing is especially top-of-mind for those aged 25 to 34 years (28 per cent) and registers marginally higher than average among 55 to 64 year olds (22 per cent), many of whom have children renting or looking to buy a home. Interestingly, housing gets much more attention from women (25 per cent) than men (17 per cent). Not only is housing a lightning rod issue for Government, overwhelmingly the public feel the Government is getting it wrong. Almost nine in 10 (88 per cent) verbatim comments on housing are negative in sentiment. Not surprisingly feedback centres on a lack of houses, high prices and the struggles of a generation to get on the ladder. Immigration is somewhat less topical this wave, but still features prominently. After peaking at 24 per cent in January, mentions of immigration have declined month-on-month, falling to 12 per cent in this latest poll. One in four comments (24 per cent) on immigration are supportive of Government policy and the efforts being made to accommodate new arrivals – “something that the Government has been doing is supporting refugees, which I think is a really good thing”. However, the majority of comments (76 per cent) are critical, with many expressing concerns about the scale of the challenge – “it’s going in the wrong direction completely, they haven’t got the infrastructure for all the people they are letting in the country”. The family and care referendums were not quite yesterday’s news when the latest Snapshot poll was conducted between April 2nd and 12th, mentioned by 9 per cent of respondents when asked to recall what they had seen or heard in the media recently. Very much in the news during polling was the election of Simon Harris as Taoiseach, with 7 per cent of respondents citing the change of leadership as something they had taken note of. Among those mentioning a change of leadership, about one third (35 per cent) viewed the move positively, welcoming a fresh perspective. Just less than two-thirds (62 per cent) were negative about the change, with some wondering if Leo Varadkar’s resignation (and Simon Coveney’s) hinted at difficulties for the country coming down the tracks. The cost of living/inflation is on the rise again as a topic of conversation, mentioned by 6 per cent nationally, and by 9 per cent of working-class respondents. Education is also on the up, jumping from 1 per cent to 4 per cent across the total population, and climbing as high as 10 per cent among the 15 to 24s. Coverage of Simon Harris’s achievements as Minister for Further and Higher Education is likely responsible for some of this uplift. Registering at their lowest levels in 2024 and struggling to cut through the noise are climate change/sustainability (2 per cent) and the Palestine/Israel conflict (2 per cent). Perhaps the most intriguing Snapshot poll trend has been the HSE/health service’s relatively low profile during the winter months. A recent Ipsos What Worries The World poll conducted across 33 countries ranked Ireland as the country most worried about healthcare, yet just 3 per cent of Snapshot respondents answered with a healthcare-related issue when asked what they had seen or heard recently that indicated if the country was going in the right or wrong direction. Healthcare is clearly still important, but problems in other areas such as housing and immigration are making the headlines. For the time being at least.",0,1
2024/4/29,"Housing is the top issue for voters, especially those aged 25-34 Almost nine out of 10 voters who mention housing have a negative view of the Government’s efforts Housing has returned to the top of the list of issues that voters are noticing about the Government’s performance once again this month. The April Ipsos Snapshot for The Irish Times shows that after a period in which housing was supplanted first by immigration and then by last month’s referendums, housing is once again the issue most often mentioned by voters when asked what they have noticed about what the Government is doing. Over one fifth (21 per cent) of voters named housing when they are asked what they had noticed about what the Government has done in the last month, and whether they thought it pushed the country in the right or wrong direction. The monthly survey seeks to gauge what voters are noticing about what the Government is doing and what their general perception of those efforts is. The series confirms that housing is the issue at the top of their minds – today, for the eighth month out of 10 in which the survey has been completed, housing is the top issue. The enduring strength of the housing issue in surveys – which have been conducted by Ipsos every month since last summer and have appeared on the last Monday of every month in The Irish Times since January of this year – suggests that its prominence as a political issue will remain undimmed as the general election approaches. Worryingly for the Government there has been little indication that the public feel it is getting on top of the issue. Almost nine out of 10 voters (88 per cent) who mention housing have a negative view of the Government’s efforts. Most concerned about housing are those in the 25-34 age cohort, where 28 per cent say housing is the thing they have noticed in the last month. The other enduring issue signalled by the survey is immigration, which is cited as noticed by 12 per cent of respondents, though this represents a slight decline of two points from last month. Though prominent in people’s perceptions, immigration has declined from earlier this year when almost a quarter of people were citing it as the issue they had noticed most. As with housing the perception of the Government’s performance is mostly negative – 76 per cent of comments made to researchers were negative. The change in the Taoiseach’s office – with the elevation of Simon Harris to the role and the resignation of Leo Varadkar – made a limited impact on the consciousness of most voters. Just 7 per cent cited it as the thing they noticed most, with 62 per cent of those comments negative and 35 per cent positive. The finding demonstrates the relative lack of interest among the public about which politician does what job – as opposed to how they do it. The new survey asks more than 1,000 respondents the following question: “What have you come across in what the Government has said or done recently that has made you think the country is going in the right or wrong direction?” Their responses are then collated and sorted by issue and whether they view the Government in a positive or negative light as a result. A selection of their verbatim responses is also carried in today’s Irish Times. The data was collected using Omnipoll, Ipsos’s telephone omnibus survey which interviews a fresh, nationally representative sample of 1,000 adults aged 15-plus every two weeks. The sample used includes both mobile and landline phone numbers. The data for today’s report was collected between April 2nd and 12th.",0,1

2024/4/3,"Government departments and State bodies leave €532m in capital allocations unspent  Despite extreme need, Department of Housing fails to use €141 million available to it last year and carries it over into 2024 More than €140 million earmarked for the building of social and affordable housing last year went unspent with the money carried over into the 2024 budget, newly-published figures from the Parliamentary Budget Office indicate. A total of €532 million in capital spending was carried over from 2023 across 15 Government departments and State bodies, according to the figures, with the departments of housing, transport and health accounting for just over two-thirds, €351.9 million, of the overall sum. Housing topped the list with €141 million unspent, followed very closely behind by the Department of Transport, which carried over €140.9 million; and the Department of Health, which failed to spend €70 million of its capital allocation for the year. The figure for the Department of Housing brings its cumulative figure for the past four years to €1.66 billion with more than €1.1 billion of that having been earmarked for the provision of social and affordable housing. The figures, the department has previously said, were significantly affected by Covid-19, which slowed building activity and the carry-over for last year is down from €471 million in 2022. Sinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin said the total net underspend on social and affordable housing last year was about €206 million, out of a budget of more than €2 billion, but that funds were reallocated to other non-housing purposes as the year went on. “Any underspend and carry over in the programmes of the Department of Housing is completely unacceptable,” he said. “The capital allocations and the delivery targets for social affordable housing are far too low. And the Government’s year-on-year failure to meet those targets of new-build social affordable homes has the direct result of leading to increases in homelessness, but also increases in house prices and rents. “Minister [for Housing Darragh] O’Brien has failed to spend his full capital allocation every year and at a time of rising construction-sector inflation, surely the Minister should be looking for extra money to deliver on his targets, not failing to spend what he receives.” Mr Ó Broin said the unspent funds should have provided thousands of homes “at a time when the numbers of single people and households in emergency accommodation has reached historic heights”. The total capital carry-over across the various departments and other bodies represented some 3.8 per cent of the €13 billion capital budget for this year but the figure is far more significant for individual departments or organisations. The €45 million underspend at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, represents about 15 per cent of that department’s 2024 capital budget while the €15 million carry-over at An Garda Síochána is equivalent to almost 10 per cent of the force’s capital budget for this year. The budget office raises concern that such carry-overs can make accountability for spends and efficiency difficult as the precise costs of specific projects become less clear to outside observers. The more than €500 million carried over, however, is dwarfed by the total sum surrendered, or returned unspent, although this €1.7 million figure for 2023 includes funds from across all budgets, including current allocations. By far the standout instance under this heading is the Department of Enterprise and Employment, which surrendered just over €644 million of its initial allocation of €1.62 billion for 2023, about 40 per cent of the total. The budget of the department, which funds the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and a range of business and other programmes, is larger than usual at present because of about €650 million in annual funding associated with the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme. However, it has surrendered €1.669 billion in unspent funding over the past decade according to the report. The Department of Transport said 95 per cent of its capital allocation had been spent as planned, while the Department of Enterprise said it had “received significant additional allocations over the course of recent budgets to allow it and its agencies to support businesses impacted by the effects of Brexit, Covid-19, the war on Ukraine, the cost-of-living crisis, etc. “Over the last two years significant funding allocated to the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme to support businesses impacted by increased energy costs was not required for a number of factors, including mitigation measures which were put in place across Europe, including increased storage capacity for natural gas which lead to prices falling rather than increasing,” it added. The Department of Housing was also approached for comment.",0,1
2024/4/3,"Biden official claims Ireland changed alcohol labelling rules after US pressure Irish health officials say nothing changed due to US lobbying despite claim in trade representative’s report A member of president Joe Biden’s cabinet claimed in a new report that Ireland changed new alcohol labelling restrictions in the face of pressure from the US. The claims were immediately dismissed by the Department of Health, which said the disputed measures were part of the Government’s original plan. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly signed legal restrictions last May to compel alcohol manufacturers to label beer, wine and spirits with health warnings on the risk of liver disease and fatal cancers and risks from drinking alcohol while pregnant. At the time the Government described the regime as the world’s “first comprehensive health labelling of alcohol products”, saying the drink makers would be required to set out the calorie content and grams of alcohol in their products. The measures won’t come into force until 2026, to give business time to adapt. But the US has said objections from Washington at a key committee of the World Trade Organisation led Ireland to change how the measures will be applied, saying the transition period was prolonged and allowances given to apply health warnings on stickers. The US said the concerns were raised at the technical barriers to trade (TBT) committee of the WTO. The committee is a panel for governments to discuss specific concerns about regulations or trade, often about measures still in the pipeline for implementation later. The contested claims were set out in a report from US trade representative Katherine Tai, a senior member of the Biden administration who is the main trade adviser and negotiator for the US president. Referring to Mr Donnelly’s regulations, the US 2024 national trade estimate report on foreign trade barriers said the measures set “unique health labelling requirements” for drink. “While supportive of the goals of the regulation, in June and November 2023, the United States raised procedural concerns about the regulation in the WTO TBT committee,” the report said. “Ireland responded extending the transition period and by permitting importers to affix stickers with the required information to imported products.” Asked about the US report, the Department of Health said the Irish labelling law was submitted for EU assessment in June 2022 and the WTO in February 2023. “The law was signed by the Minister for Health in May 2023 and will come into operation in May 2026,” the Department said. “The provisions in relation to the transition period and the option of affixing stickers with the required information were in the original draft of the legislation when submitted for EU assessment, and were not introduced during the WTO process or in response to concerns raised by a WTO member.” Ireland has clashed in the past with US politicians over health measures.

2024/4/3,"Sinn Féin-led Government would devolve more powers to directly elected mayor of Limerick - Quinlivan  Limerick city TD enters race to become mayor despite concerns over limitations of office A Sinn Féin-led Government would devolve more powers to the directly elected mayor of Limerick, the party’s TD in the city Maurice Quinlivan has said. He has announced his intention to seek his party’s nomination to contest the mayoral election despite his concerns over the limits of the office. Sinn Féin’s Ard Chomhairle is expected to make a final decision on the party’s candidate this weekend. The mayoral election is happening on June 7th, the same day as the local and European elections. The job comes with a salary of just more than €154,000 and a budget of €8 million a year to be spent on projects and initiatives. It is the first office of its kind in Ireland and the most significant power the mayor will have is proposing the annual budget for Limerick City and County Council. This will still have to be approved by councillors. The new mayor will also propose the five-year Local Development Plan and will have access to Cabinet ministers with a set number of meetings each year. Mr Quinlivan previously criticised the powers available to the new mayor claiming last year that the legislation underpinning the office was “very disappointing for most people in Limerick”. He said the new the mayor should have sufficient powers to ensure it “would not just be a ribbon-cutting position”. He told The Irish Times on Wednesday: “I made those comments deliberately to try to get the Government to enhance what they’re doing but I genuinely do believe that there’s potential to expand this role. “If I’m elected as Sinn Féin mayor hopefully in a year or so there will be a Sinn Féin minister in Government,” adding that his party has committed to legislate to devolve further powers to the new mayor of Limerick. Additional powers proposed by the party include giving the mayor the ability to purchase land; bringing municipal waste collection back under council control; and the ability to make Limerick a “living wage local authority” where contracts would go to companies that pay their workers a living wage. Mr Quinlivan also said the mayor should have a role in policing through direct involvement in new Community Safety Partnerships which are due to replace the existing Joint Policing Committee. He said antisocial behaviour, crime, drug dealing and addiction are a key issue for Limerick and a focus for him in the job would be “strengthening communities”. He highlighted housing and trying to deliver social and affordable homes as another big issue. Mr Quinlivan said one way the mayor could have an impact on this is speeding up the renovation of “200-plus” vacant council-owned homes to bring them back into use saying this can happen “with the political will”. The other declared candidates in the race are Dee Ryan of Fianna Fáil; Green Party TD Brian Leddin; Social Democrats councillor Elisa O’Donovan; People Before Profit’s Ruairí Fahy; Sarah Beasley of Aontú; Dr Laura Keyes of green left-wing party An Rabharta Glas; and Independents John Moran and Helen O’Donnell.",0,1
2024/4/3,"Coalition leaders urged to push for Ireland to secure energy portfolio in new EU Commission Senator Lisa Chambers argues Ireland’s offshore energy potential could benefit country and Europe The Coalition party leaders have been urged to push for Ireland to secure the powerful energy portfolio in the next European Commission to be formed this year. Fianna Fáil Midlands Northwest European election candidate Senator Lisa Chambers made the call, arguing that Ireland’s offshore energy potential could benefit this country and Europe as a whole. She wrote to incoming Taoiseach, Fine Gael leader Simon Harris, Tánaiste Micheál Martin of Fianna Fáil, and Green Party Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan asking them to use their influence in Europe in a bid to win the energy brief at the commission. A new commission will be formed later this year, and Ursula von der Leyen is seeking a second term as its president. It is the commission president that selects which portfolio is assigned to each commissioner. In her letter to the Coalition leaders Ms Chambers wrote that the energy portfolio “is not just crucial for Ireland; it also represents a strategic European interest”. “Ireland, due to its access to a high-quality wind corridor off the west coast, is uniquely positioned to drive the transition to offshore energy, delivering not just for our nation but for the whole of Europe.” She said: “In your capacities as national party leaders within your respective European political groupings – Fianna Fáil in the Renew Europe and ALDE Party, Fine Gael in the EPP, and the Green Party in the European Greens – it is imperative that we present a united front to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We must advocate for the assignment of the energy portfolio to Ireland”. Ms Chambers said: “The urgency of energy independence for Europe and Ireland has been cast into sharp focus by the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia that has resulted in increased energy bills for Irish households, in addition to other cost-of-living challenges for all citizens.” Her call has been backed by several members of Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party. A spokeswoman for Green Party leader Mr Ryan said he has “consistently advocated for more strategic and aligned European interconnection and market design to maximise the potential of a pan-European integrated supergrid and market”. “Minister Ryan would welcome an Irish commissioner for energy at EU level. Minister Ryan understands that it is a competency of the incoming president of the commission to allocate the commissionerships.”",0,1
2024/4/3,"Political advisers and former journalists to form part of Simon Harris backroom team Ex-Green Party aide and one-time special adviser to Eoghan Murphy, Jack O’Donnell among names recruited by incoming taoiseach Presumptive taoiseach Simon Harris has poached a key adviser from the Green Party to come on board as part of his backroom team. Jack O’Donnell, who had been working as an adviser to Green Party super-junior minister Pippa Hackett, is to join the expanding team being lined up to work with Mr Harris after his anticipated election as taoiseach next Tuesday. Mr O’Donnell is a former special adviser to Eoghan Murphy during the latter’s time in the Department of Housing, and previously worked in Government Buildings with Enda Kenny when he was Taoiseach. He will join a group of advisers including Chris Donoghue, who until recently worked with Minister for Enterprise Simon Coveney, but who is now set to be appointed as Government press secretary. On Tuesday, Mr Coveney announced that he will not seek reappointment to Mr Harris’ Cabinet next week, freeing up a second full portfolio to fill alongside the one vacated by the incoming taoiseach, who was elected as Fine Gael leader late last month after Leo Varadkar’s surprise resignation. It is expected that former Irish Times journalist Sarah Bardon and Mr Harris’ former adviser in the Department of Health, Joanne Lonergan, will be the most senior advisers to the Wicklow TD. Ms Bardon has worked with Mr Harris since 2018, while Ms Lonergan left politics to work in public relations consultancy for a period but is expected to rejoin the team. Irish Examiner journalist Ciara Phelan is to join as deputy Government press secretary, while two members of Mr Varadkar’s staff, Clare Mungovan and Matt Lynch, are expected to remain. Another former adviser to Mr Harris, Majella Fitzpatrick, is tipped to rejoin him. Mr Harris is also said to be eyeing an economic adviser, likely to operate on a part-time basis similar to the role filled by Prof Alan Ahearne in the Tánaiste’s office.",0,1
2024/4/30,"UN Security Council veto to be removed for Defence Forces deployment under new plans Cabinet also set to agree a €79.5 million package for farmers and landowners whose forests have been impacted by ash dieback Irish troops will be sent overseas following a national decision-making process with no veto for the UN Security Council, under plans due to be approved by Cabinet on Tuesday. Tánaiste Micheál Martin will bring a memo to Cabinet with proposals to change existing legislation governing overseas deployments for the Defence Forces. Mr Martin will seek Government approval to draft a Bill which will remove the current triple-lock system of deployment. Under the existing triple-lock mechanism, which sets the conditions for the deployment of Defence Forces’ personnel for peacekeeping, any such mission must come with a UN mandate and be approved by the Government. If more than 12 personnel are deployed and are armed, it must also be approved by a Dáil resolution. Mr Martin will tell Ministers that the new legislation will not change Ireland’s traditional position of military neutrality, and that the new law will remain fully consistent with the principles of the UN charter and international law. Government and Dáil approval would still be needed for the dispatch of Defence Forces’ personnel to take part in peacekeeping and similar missions. At present, the UN Security Council has responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security but no new peacekeeping mission has been approved by it in a decade. The current system effectively allows UN Security Council members to veto deployment of the Defence Forces. Mr Martin is expected to tell Cabinet that there is a growing need to be able to dispatch troops quickly with the flexibility to urgently respond to any crisis where, for example, Irish citizens require assistance abroad. He will also say that in the case of the evacuation of citizens, the global security situation has changed fundamentally over recent years leading to an increasing demand to assist with evacuation operations. The new legislation will also look to “simplify” authorisation for Ireland to participate in international live military exercises, such as around the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy. Separately, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien will update Ministers on ongoing work to protect the integrity of elections from misinformation and artificial intelligence (AI) manipulation. A new framework has been developed following a request from the Minister to An Coimisiún, and targets online platforms, online search engines, political parties and election candidates. Also on Tuesday, Green Party Minister of State for Land Use Pippa Hackett and Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue will seek Cabinet approval for a €79.5 million package for farmers and landowners whose forests have been impacted by ash dieback. The €79.5 million fund will see farmers given a €5,000 per hectare payment when they clear ash sites and re-establish new forests in their place. The average ash plantation is 3 hectares, meaning a payment of €15,000 for those landowners. A farmer with 10 hectares of ash will be eligible to receive €50,000 in addition in addition to grants covering the costs of clearing and re-establishing the site. Farmers who have already cleared and re-established sites under previous ash dieback schemes will also qualify for this €5,000 per hectare payment.",0,1

The pair met on Thursday morning and the Galway West TD said  afterwards that he will be voting for Mr Harris on Tuesday. He offered no details on what was discussed at the meeting. Mr Harris now has the expected support of five Independent TDs, boosting the Government’s slim Dáil majority.

He said he is waiting for the Fine Gael leader to revert to him on some issues and he has not yet decided on which way he will vote. Kildare South Independent TD Cathal Berry met Mr Harris on Thursday morning. Prior to the meeting, Mr Berry, who voted for both Micheál Martin and Leo Varadkar as taoiseach in 2020 and 2022, said a mini-budget before the Dáil rises for its summer break was “vital”, and that he wanted to see extra measures for small businesses and farmers. After the talks Mr Berry said he had a “good discussion” with Mr Harris on “national security, a financial support package for sectors in difficulty, how best to address the cost of living crisis and the need to expedite school building projects.” He told The Irish Times he will will discuss outcome with his team and supporters and “then consider how best to proceed” when it comes to how he will vote in the Dáil next week. Mr Harris has ruled out doing deals with Independents in exchange for their support and said the meetings he would be having with them would not be “transactional”.

2024/4/4,"Sinn Féin disputes findings of report suggesting united Ireland to cost €20bn annually Donegal TD  Pádraig Mac Lochlainn insists actual cost is less than headline figure in IIEA study Sinn Féin has disputed the methodology of a report by the Institute of International and European Affairs which said that a united Ireland would cost €20 billion every year for 20 years. The report is authored by the Economic and Social Research Institute’s John FitzGerald of Trinity College Dublin, and Dublin City University academic Prof Edgar Morgenroth. Excluding the impact of Covid on public spending everywhere, the two academics put the cost of the UK treasury’s contribution to the running of Northern Ireland at £10.5 billion (€12.3 billion) annually, the figure given in 2019. Basic unification costs after losing the London subvention and adjusting for other factors would run to nearly €11 billion a year. However, the cost would jump to €20.5 billion if social welfare, pensions and public service pay rates to people in Northern Ireland were brought into line with those currently in force in the Republic. Funding this would require an increase in taxation of around 25 per cent and a significant reduction in expenditure, the report says. Sinn Féin party whip Pádraig Mac Lochlainn told RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show that the analysis was static and accepted the amount of subvention from the British government at face value. “Prof John Doyle of DCU in recent times, has written that the actual subvention is much less. It’s about €2.4 billion. That’s about a quarter of what the British government, when you deduct their pensions, debt repayments, contribution to the defence forces of Britain and so on. “And so it’s much less than the headline figure,” the Donegal TD said. “But also the report assumes there’ll be no economic growth in the North. We know that since Brexit there’s been substantial growth in the all Ireland economy. We know that there is a real opportunity, and that’s thanks to the efforts of all of the political parties and people on the island of Ireland,” he said. “We ensured there was no hard border on the island of Ireland. That means the people of the north of Ireland have access to the British economy and to the European economy uniquely so, there’s a real opportunity for economic growth.” Mr MacLochlainn pointed to reports from Prof Kurt Huebner, who worked on German reunification and looked at the model that they used and how that would apply to Ireland. “He forecast €35 billion of growth over eight years. You have people like David McWilliams who’ve talked about how we could manage this.” Minister of Finance for Northern Ireland Caoimhe Archibald also disputed the report’s findings. “Economic performance in the north has suffered enormously as a result of partition and more recently the negative impact of Brexit. Reunification would best serve Ireland’s economic interests and would deliver economic and social benefits for the whole island,” the Sinn Féin MLA said in a statement. “Professor Kurt Huebner, for example, reported that Irish unity could boost the all-island economy by €35 billion over eight years. The key now is planning and preparation.” Mr MacLochlainn called for a Citizens’ Assembly and a White Paper from the Government on the issue of reunification. “Nobody assumes that in the context of Irish reunification, where people on both sides of the border have voted for a united Ireland, that the British Government just walks away from the pitch.” He said there was a process through the Belfast Agreement though which Britain would continue to have a responsibility to unionists. “I am very open to that as an Irish republican, that the unionist population on the island would continue to have some type of relationship with Britain,” he said. “You have to assume that Britain will have and indeed would step up to take financial responsibility, moving forward. So I think this report is the worst-case scenario.” Speaking on the same broadcast, Mr Morgenroth responded to this saying: “It’s not actually a worst-case scenario because there are a whole range of costs that you would have to face with a united Ireland that are not included. He said some might seem like “trivial things” like changing road signage saying: “that’s going to cost money that we did not count.” Mr Morgenroth said: “There are much bigger costs that we haven’t counted either. ” He also responded to criticism of the findings from economist Seamus McGuinness who pointed out on social media platform X that the subvention from the UK only exists because of Northern Ireland’s low productivity. Mr Morgenroth said: “absolutely productivity could rise in Northern Ireland but ... the evidence is that regions that lag in productivity tend not to actually catch-up with the richer regions.” Meanwhile, Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín also disputed the report’s finding saying it “has a number of big problems”. He said the study “takes as a given that the North of Ireland would exit with a portion of British national debt. “The burdening of Ireland with British debt is not a given.” Mr Tóibín also said none of the estimates include savings from reducing public sector duplication” Pensions have been paid for by people’s national security contributions in the North,” he said, adding that the British government “would owe pensions to people who have paid contributions until unity”. Mr Tóibín said: “Incredibly the report leaves out the elephant in the room, that in a united Ireland, the north’s economy would be turbo-boosted. “It would be working off a significantly lower cost base, would reap the benefits of a lower corporation tax base, better productivity and better integration in the Irish and EU markets.” Mr Tóibín, who is running in the European elections as a candidate for the Midlands Northwest constituency, said: “Given the growing support for Irish unity, its time that the Government undertook comprehensive modelling of the likely economic outcomes of a united Ireland.” Leader of the Opposition at Stormont and SDLP MLA, Matthew O’Toole, said there appeared to be an emphasis on a “deadweight cost” in the report’s calculation on subvention – and very little focus on the economic benefits of Irish unity. O’Toole, a former Whitehall civil servant who co-ordinated Downing St communications and policy prior to the 2016 Brexit Referendum, acknowledged that the authors “ask serious questions that still need to be answered”. “But that doesn’t mean I agree or that you should simply accept this analysis as fact,” he said. “My impression is that they appear to be very sceptical in that they don’t really attribute much to synergy in the North-South economy or public services; there does appear to be a particular emphasis on cost. “Most reasonable academics have said there will clearly be synergy around public service delivery; that’s not to say, there won’t be costs because there will be costs. “I think it would be trivial to pretend that this report does not require serious consideration. But there are many other plausible economic analyses which do not simply assume a deadweight cost on this scale. “It’s one thing to be frank about costs, it’s another thing to ignore benefits,” Mr O’Toole said.",0,1
2024/4/5,"State investment fund pulls out of Israeli companies operating in illegal settlements NTMA says value of funds in six companies is under €3m and and says it will keep other investments in region ‘under review’ The State-owned Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) will divest itself of shareholdings in a number of Israeli companies that have activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, citing the “risk profile” of the investments which are valued at just under €3 million. The fund, which is operated by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), will also review other investments in the region to ensure they align with the fund’s investment parameters and objectives, Minister for Finance Michael McGrath said on Friday. The decision relates to ISIF’s investments in six companies that have activities in the occupied territories: Bank Hapoalim BM; Bank Leumi-le Israel BM; Israel Discount Bank; Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd; First International Bank and Rami Levi CN Stores. “I have been advised by the NTMA that it has decided to divest from certain ISIF global portfolio investments in companies that have certain activities in the occupied Palestinian territory,” Mr McGrath said in a statement. “ISIF has determined that the risk profile of these investments is no longer within its investment parameters and that the commercial objectives of these investments can be achieved via other investments.” He said the decision would be implemented as soon as possible over the coming weeks. According to its 2021 annual report, ISIF has investments in nine companies named in the UN Human Rights Council database of businesses involved in certain activities related to the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory. Sinn Féin’s Illegal Settlements Divestments Bill, which is currently at the second stage in the Oireachtas, would force the NTMA to ensure ISIF is not invested in any companies on the database. “I am advised ISIF will keep under review the alignment of relevant investments within its investment parameters and commercial objectives,” the Minister said in a statement. “While recognising the independence of ISIF in the management of the investment portfolio, I believe this is the correct investment decision in respect of the assets it manages on behalf of the State.” A spokesman for the NTMA declined to comment on the timing of the decision, coming in the same week in which the Israeli Defence Forces faced widespread condemnation for a fatal attack on an aid convoy in the Gaza Strip. The agency also declined to comment on the nature of the risks associated with its investments in companies involved in some way with illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian land and why it invested in those companies in the first instance. Sinn Féin spokesman on foreign affairs John Brady welcomed the NTMA’s decision but said the Government continued to obstruct the passage of the Illegal Settlements Divestment Bill. He called on the Coalition to enact the legislation and to initiate an immediate audit of the entire portfolio held by NTMA to ensure that “all shareholdings in businesses that support and make illegal settlements viable are also divested from”. Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik said the move was a step in the right direction. “The relentless violence and suffering endured by the people of Gaza demands urgent international attention. It is heartening to see the NTMA taking steps to divest from investments in companies operating in the occupied territories, but this is just the beginning.”",0,1
2024/4/5,"Labour MP Creasy criticises Republic for silence over Rwanda plan’s impact on Belfast Agreement Tánaiste Micheál Martin ignored pleas for intervention, high-profile MP says A high-profile Labour MP in Britain has complained she is being ignored by Tánaiste Micheál Martin after raising concerns with him over the UK government’s attitude to the Belfast Agreement. Stella Creasy, who also chairs Labour’s Movement for Europe, has also called on the Government to stand up for the agreement by challenging UK prime minister Rishi Sunak over his proposed new Rwanda deportation regime, which could disrupt the 26-year-old treaty that ended the Troubles. Ms Creasy wrote to Mr Martin on December 7th asking for his views on the UK’s Safety of Rwanda Bill, which aims to enable the deportation to the African country of illegal migrants in the UK. The Bill, which was passed in the House of Commons but is now stuck in the House of Lords, proposes to restrict the ability of migrants in the UK to bring cases to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). That appears to be a potential breach of the Belfast Agreement, which enshrined access to the ECHR as a right for all people in the North. Mr Sunak this week also threatened this week to completely withdraw from the convention underpinning the ECHR if the court tries to stop his Rwanda plan. Ms Creasy says Mr Martin and the Government have “steadfastly refused” to respond to her December letter and subsequent attempts to raise concerns over the potential threat to the Belfast Agreement from Mr Sunak’s Rwanda deportation plan. “I want them to defend the importance of the Good Friday Agreement and that means holding the UK government to account,” she said. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission have both expressed concerns over the impact of the Rwanda plan on the North’s peace treaty. Irish government sources, meanwhile, say Mr Martin and his officials are wary of being seen to pick another fight with Mr Sunak’s government on this issue, having already recently filed legal action against the UK for unilaterally giving immunity, including to British soldiers, for crimes committed during the Troubles. The sources say the Tánaiste is reluctant to get dragged into a controversial aspect of UK domestic politics, such as the Rwanda debate, and this is also why the Department of Foreign Affairs has stonewalled Ms Creasy, who has grown increasingly frustrated at the lack of a response. Ms Creasy told The Irish Times this week it is “obvious” the UK government did not even consult the Government in the Republic about the provisions of the Rwanda Bill that appear to contradict the ECHR clause of the Belfast Agreement. “If I was the Irish Government, I would be very insulted by the approach in the UK. If they didn’t even bother asking you before making changes that affect the Good Friday Agreement, then what else might they do without consultation?” said Ms Creasy. She has previously requested help from Labour TDs, including the party’s leader Ivana Bacik, by challenging the Government in the Dáil over its reluctance to become involved. They received only vague responses. Mr Martin’s officials this week chose not to directly comment when asked about why his department was ignoring Ms Creasy on the issue, and referred instead to a previous response to Ms Bacik in which the Tánaiste said only that the Government was “following” the UK’s Rwanda debate.",0,1
2024/4/5,"Donohoe warned against stronger care referendum wording regarding spending risk Officials in Minister for Public Expenditure’s office cautioned colleagues in Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman’s department on State’s ‘mandatory obligation’  Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe warned Cabinet colleague Roderic O’Gorman of “extensive policy and expenditure risks” in the care referendum, in a clash over the extent of new duties on the State. One month after voters overwhelmingly rejected the care amendment, internal files point to a schism over the referendum between Mr Donohoe and the Minister for Equality. Mr Donohoe’s officials expressed concern about “major risk” in proposals for the March vote before the Government watered down the original wording to avoid a “mandatory obligation” on the State. As Mr Donohoe pushed back against the Green Minister, the officials expressed anxiety about a “wide range of known and potentially unknown demands for additional supports which would entail significant expenditure risks”. Mr Donohoe sent a letter to Mr O’Gorman last May saying the referendum could leave the State “open to undue risk and litigation”, according to files released under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act. Two months later the secretary general in Mr Donohoe’s department wrote to his counterpart in Mr O’Gorman’s department highlighting the need for the Cabinet to consider “analysis and quantification of the potential cost implications” and pointing to “risks highlighted” by Attorney General Rossa Fanning. Citing FoI exemptions, the Department of Public Expenditure redacted Mr Fanning’s advice from the files. In the March 8th referendum, a 73.93 per cent majority of voters rejected care amendments to “strive to support” care and delete mothers’ duties from the Constitution. Critics argued that the proposal would deny disabled people “the right to State support”. In previously disclosed files, Department of Finance officials said the “strive” wording was “intended to avoid a concrete and mandatory obligation to provide support”. Still, Mr O’Gorman’s spokesman said Mr Fanning’s advice “outlined the significance of the term strive, including potential successful litigation against the State”. The “strive” wording had changed from earlier drafts that would have imposed an obligation on the State to provide “reasonable” support for care. Another proposal saying the State “shall endeavour” to provide care was also dropped. In the separate family referendum on the same day, a 67.69 per cent majority rejected amendments recognising families in “other durable relationships” in addition to marriage families. The public expenditure records include an official warning of “potential expenditure risks” in the original care proposal. The warning cited Mr Fanning’s advice raising “significant issues” with proposals to replace the constitutional reference to women in the home with a “reasonable” support obligation. In a document for Mr Donohoe early in the talks, officials said the Government could increase support for care through “more appropriate statutory means” and the annual budget. As the talks neared a conclusion last November, department officials complained that a draft Government memorandum on the referendum was “not likely” to be circulated for ministerial observations. “Given that this will be a memo for decision and given that that proposed amendment for decision carries a risk of imposing significant Exchequer costs in the future the Minister for [Public Expenditure] should be provided an opportunity to share his [observations],” an official wrote. Such concerns were in line with earlier correspondence, expressing anxiety about “potential for significant unintended consequences and costs”. Mr O’Gorman’s department was urged to stress in Cabinet papers the risk set out by Mr Fanning. “The implications of this risk need to be sufficiently expanded upon in the paper to be considered by [the] Cabinet committee,” said a May note from public expenditure officials. “These issues need to clearly set out in their own section of the paper for Government to be sufficiently informed of these potentially significant negative unintended implications,” the note added. “More generally, is there a precedent effect here that needs to be considered with regard to enshrining socio-economic rights in the Constitution? It is [the Department of Public Expenditure’s] view that to date these risks, including those to the Exchequer, have not been sufficiently quantified or communicated to Government up to this point.”",0,1
2024/4/5,"What Independent TDs get for supporting the Government is far less clear than in decades past Coalition deals with Independents have been commonplace for decades, though Simon Harris has ruled out ‘transactional’ arrangements on his path to the Taoiseach’s office There was a time in Irish politics when it was clear to the public what Independent TDs were getting in return for supporting an incoming taoiseach. Constituency deals, backed by millions of euro in funding, were commonplace for years. The prototype for such arrangements remains the legendary “Gregory Deal” of February 1982. Fianna Fáil leader Charles Haughey agreed to a multimillion pound investment to the disadvantaged Dublin Central constituency to win the support of newly-elected Independent TD Tony Gregory for his party’s return to power. In later years Bertie Ahern’s government needed the support of Independents, most notably Kerry South TD Jackie Healy-Rae and Tipperary TD Michael Lowry after the 2007 general election. Healy-Rae was able to claim credit for huge investment into his home county. “There were always bits of roads, bits of bends, bits of housing...and all the things that were important to the local people,” Ahern later said of his deals struck with Healy-Rae. In recent years the benefits for supportive Independent TDs have been a lot less obvious. But the benefits running the other way are clear: the backing of the Independents has bolstered the current Coalition’s slim majority on numerous occasions such as for votes to elect taoisigh and confidence motions. There has been a general insistence by Government that no constituency deals are done in return for such support. One of the clearest examples of Independents supporting the Government in a crunch Dáil vote was the defeat in March 2023 of a Sinn Féin motion calling for the temporary eviction ban to be extended. The Government secured a majority of 83 votes to 68 in the Dáil having put forward a counter-motion with an amendment from the Regional Independent Group which had proposed various housing measures. Then minister for public expenditure Paschal Donohoe said that the measures suggested by the Independents had also been proposed by the Government parties. The new Fine Gael leader, Simon Harris, has been meeting Independents in advance of Tuesday’s Dáil vote to elect him as taoiseach, but has ruled out agreeing deals, saying the meetings would not be “transactional”. Five Independents have already indicated that they will support Harris. They includes Lowry whose talks with Harris covered issues including small businesses and the overcrowding situation at University Hospital Limerick that treats many of the Tipperary TD’s constituents. On small business there have already been calls from within Fine Gael for new supports before the summer so Lowry may well be pushing on an open door there. Any incoming taoiseach would want to be seen to be taking action to address problems at a major hospital in the midwest region. The support of Independents may become more crucial should the Government’s numbers tighten further before the next general election, which must be held by next spring. One thing Independents undoubtedly secure out of the Government’s paper-thin Dáil majority is access to senior Coalition figures, from which they can claim to influence policy when they next face voters. What they secure in return for their support is much less clear than it has been in the past.",0,1
2024/4/5,"Complaint about donations to Leo Varadkar does not need criminal investigation, gardaí say People Before Profit councillor Hazel De Nortúin submitted complaint which has been referred back to Standards in Public Office Gardaí have determined that a complaint about donations to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar does not meet the threshold for criminal investigation and have referred the matter back to the Standards in Public Office (Sipo) watchdog. Earlier this year, People Before Profit councillor Hazel De Nortúin submitted a complaint to Gardaí about three donation statements made by Mr Varadkar. That complaint was then referred to senior gardaí. However a source confirmed to The Irish Times that after consideration, gardaí have determined that the complaint does not meet the threshold for criminal investigation, and that the matter has been referred back to the Standards in Public Office (Sipo). A spokesman for An Garda Siochana confirmed that there is no criminal investigation. “An Garda Síochána does not comment on complaints made by or against named individuals. “In general, such complaints are assessed to see if the allegation(s) meets the threshold for a potential criminal offence. There is no such criminal investigation into such a complaint.” “In general, when it has been assessed that there is no potential criminal offence, such matters are referred to SIPO.” Last summer, Mr Varadkar confirmed that the Sipo had queried donations made to him, with a spokesman saying at the time that such queries were a regular occurrence between politicians and Sipo. The queries were in relation to fundraisers he held in 2018 and 2022. Mr Varadkar received a donation of €1,033 from Dr Ray Power, a general practitioner and co-founder of the medical practice network, Centric Health. As the donation was above the allowable limit of €1,000 from a single individual, a sum of €33 has since been returned by Mr Varadkar. Two donations were also refunded to PR company Edelman, following donations the company made to two fundraisers. It is understood there was confusion around whether the individual attendees who used Edelman’s tickets had in fact reimbursed the company. Ultimately, the donations were reimbursed. Under the law donations of more than €600 must be declared to Sipo. A spokesman for Mr Varadkar said gardaí have not contacted him about the matter. “The Taoiseach’s opponents regularly make complaints about him to Sipo, the Gardaí, the courts and even the Medical Council. The Taoiseach is fully compliant with the requirements of the Standards in Public Office Commission with regard to political donations and has been informed that Sipo has no outstanding queries or questions for him. The Gardaí have not been in contact with the Taoiseach about this matter.” A spokesman for SIPO said: “Due to the nature of SIPO’s role as an impartial oversight body, and in order to be fair to all parties involved, we do not provide any comment regarding individual cases of compliance.”",0,1
2024/4/6,"What is an Irish political party ardfheis and why does it matter? University of Galway to host Simon Harris’ first ardfheis as Fine Gael leader, with the party hoping to ‘reset’ and ‘reconnect’ with voters On Saturday, Fine Gael will hold a daylong ardfheis at the University of Galway, Simon Harris’ first as party leader. At it he will outline his priorities and plans for the party that he says is seeking to “renew, reset and reconnect” with voters. An ardfheis or “high assembly” is the biggest event in an Irish political party’s diary and is essentially a conference open to all party members. It sets out the party’s vision and priorities and gives members a chance to debate and vote on issues. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin each hold an ardfheis annually or every two years. Other parties such as the Green Party and the Labour Party have national conventions or conferences. In advance of the local and European elections, an ardfheis or national party conference offers voters a chance to get a better insight into a political party’s plans for the future. This weekend, Mr Harris as incoming taoiseach will address two audiences: his own party and you the voter. An ardfheis is a national gathering of delegates where the party as a whole can convene and take decisions. It allows members from local branches to discuss the party’s direction and policy plans. It also gives the leader a chance to outline the party’s vision or message to the public, and for the larger parties this is usually via a televised address. Alongside setting out the party’s direction, a range of motions are debated and voted on. Motions can be suggested by local branches, constituency executives or councillors and usually call on the party to take action on a particular issue. For example, at Fine Gael’s ardfheis on Saturday, more than 160 motions are scheduled. These will include calls to introduce a middle-income tax band of 30 per cent, provide lethal military aid to Ukraine, increase funding for childcare and prioritise the building of starter homes for purchase at affordable prices. If passed and, each political party has slightly different rules around motions, certain motions can feed into policy decisions or party manifestos in the future. And for all parties, including Fine Gael, the elephant in the room is the looming general election. Ministers, TDs and senators will often take part in discussions and debates on broader themes such as business, farming and housing which encompass the motions. Elections are also held for a party’s national executive committee which in the case of Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin is also known as the árd comhairle. This committee acts as a governing body of the party and makes organisational decisions.",0,1
2024/4/6,"Simon Coveney would like to see Cork minister appointed in incoming Taoiseach’s reshuffle Departing minister says decision not to put his name forward for Cabinet ‘wasn’t about being shafted’ Departing Cabinet minister Simon Coveney has said he would like to see a Cork minister in incoming Taoiseach Simon Harris’s reshuffle. Mr Coveney’s decision not to put his name forward for Cabinet means Fine Gael will not have any ministers in the county unless Mr Harris appoints a Cork TD. Mr Coveney said if Mr Harris selects a Cork politician “it might be in the junior minister ranks”. The outgoing Minister for Enterprise made the remarks at a press conference as Fine Gael began its ardfheis in Galway. There has been speculation that Cork North-Central TD Colm Burke will become a Minister of State as the only other Fine Gael TD in the county that has not said they will be stepping down at the next election. Mr Coveney has not confirmed if he will seek re-election and said he will think about it over the summer. He denied he made his decision not to put his name forward for Cabinet in case he was dropped by Mr Harris when asked if he had been “shafted” by the new Fine Gael leader. Mr Coveney said there are “lots of theories” about his decision but he insisted he decided not to put his name forward to help Fine Gael “look and feel fresh” in advance of upcoming elections. He added: “I decided that I’d make life a little bit easier for Simon. I don’t know whether I would have been in the Cabinet next week. I did speak to Simon about it a number of times. “You’d have to ask him what his view is on that. But honestly, my decision wasn’t about being shafted or anything like that.” He said it was a “deeper one”, that he had been 26 years in politics and “I felt it was time to give somebody else an opportunity”. Mr Coveney is Fine Gael’s director of elections for the upcoming European Elections. The party is running five candidates in a bid to retain the seats it holds. They are Nina Carberry, a TV star and former jockey, and sitting MEP Maria Walsh in Midlands Northwest; Senator Regina Doherty, a former minister, in Dublin; and another sitting MEP, Seán Kelly, and businessman John Mullins in Ireland South. Mr Coveney said he is not running for Europe himself. Asked where the ambition was in simply seeking to retain the seats Fine Gael  holds Mr Coveney said: “I think we have to be realistic about how we approach these elections. “If we’re going to win five I think the best strategy is to have five strong candidates.” Mr Coveney and Fine Gael’s candidates all insisted they were getting a positive reaction on the doors in the election campaign so far. Mr Kelly said the environment in the 2014 elections “was toxic” but he said there was absolutely no “toxicity” to Fine Gael on the doorsteps on this occasion because “we have delivered in this economy”. Ms Doherty said that if politicians lived exclusively on social media “you would never go out and knock on a door”. But she said that people she canvassed on the doorstep “have concerns and issues, talk to you in a normal way, not in a fighting bitchy way that you know, you can’t do on social media”. On the Gaza war, Mr Coveney said: “I think we need to say clearly that there is no future for Hamas in terms of Palestinian governance. “But having said all of that, we also need to hold Israel to account for its ferocious response to that terrorist attack and the consequences for so many innocent people in Gaza. “In simple terms, international law has to protect Palestinian children, just as it has to protect Israeli children. And I think the Government has been very consistent on that, at least the Irish Government has.” In advance of the appointment of a new European Commission later this year he again staunchly defended EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and said she had given “extraordinary leadership to the European Union at a time of incredible change and pressure”. He did not remember a leader within the European Commission who had given as much leadership from the front on Covid and on Brexit. “It’s probably the first time ever in British Irish history, that actually in terms of international decision making, Ireland’s priorities were prioritised over Britain,” he said.",0,1
2024/4/6,"Nina Carberry expects to be replaced as coach on Ireland’s Fittest Family due to European election run Former jockey says she would bring ‘resilience and perseverance’ learnt from horse racing to EU Parliament  Former jockey Nina Carberry expects to be replaced as a coach on TV show Ireland’s Fittest Family now that she is running in the European elections for Fine Gael. The former champion jockey was selected as a candidate for the party in the Midlands North-West constituency last month alongside sitting MEP and former Rose of Tralee Maria Walsh. Ms Carberry was a seven-time winner at the Cheltenham Festival and also claimed the Irish Grand National in 2011. More recently she has been involved in the business side of the sport, buying and selling horses, but had also enjoyed a burgeoning TV career. Aside from her role as a coach on RTÉ show Ireland’s Fittest Families she won Dancing with the Stars in 2022. However, speaking of her role on Ireland’s Fittest Family, she said she “probably won’t have time for it” if she is elected and it “might be something that has to go by the wayside unfortunately”. She said filming on the next series is likely to be happening shortly after June’s election, adding: “I’d imagine they’d be replacing me.” Speaking at the Fine Gael Ardfheis in Galway, Ms Carberry told The Irish Times she has always had an interest in politics, has always had a vote and “wanted to have a say” when asked why she wants to be a politician. She added: “I suppose when my two girls came along it was something that I wanted to get more involved in and have an impact on their future, and that’s the main reason.” Asked what her experience can bring to the European Parliament, Ms Carberry said: “I’ve learned a lot through my riding career. I’ve learned resilience and perseverance from a very young age. “I think I paved the way for women in racing, the likes of Rachael Blackmore coming through, I felt I helped her to achieve what she’s achieved now and I’m very proud of that.” She said when she started out in horse racing “we didn’t have the facilities, like changing rooms in certain courses so that was something I’m very proud of that they’re up to a standard now that is the exact same as men”. “I’m willing to bring all I’ve learned in that sphere through to politics and I feel that I can really impact and have a loud voice in Europe.” She said she is not deterred by the often toxic atmosphere around politics and the abuse directed at elected representatives, particularly online, saying: “Being a jockey you get very criticised online as well. “I’ve kind of tried not to look at that and just think of the positives and that’s the way I’m going to approach politics. “I realise it’s there but it’s something that I’m not going to get thrown by.” She declined to identify a main rival in Midlands North-West where Fine Gael currently has two seats – a hotly contested constituency that includes other sitting MEPs, Independent TD Luke “Ming” Flanagan and Sinn Féin’s Chris MacManus, as well as Ms Walsh. Sinn Féin is running Michelle Gildernew, a Fermanagh-South Tyrone MP, and sitting MEP Mr MacManus. The field also includes three Fianna Fáil candidates, Barry Cowen TD and Senators Lisa Chambers and Niall Blaney; Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín; former RTÉ journalist Ciaran Mullooly; and Green Party Senator Pauline O’Reilly.  Ms Carberry said: “Every one of them has a chance. “It’s like a race for me. I’m just going to approach it that way and literally keep my blinkers on and just do my own thing and get out and meet the people. “I think that’s for me is the most important part and not getting distracted what anyone else is doing.” The vast constituency includes 15 counties and Ms Carberry said: “Between myself and Maria we’ll cover it very well. She’s obviously placed on the west and I’m on the east. We’re going for every vote and we’re going to try and go and get for the two seats for Fine Gael and have a big voice in Europe.”",0,1
2024/4/6,"Simon Harris pledges to fix housing ‘once and for all’ in first ardfheis speech as Fine Gael leader ‘I’m gonna hit the ground running’: Harris promises a ‘new energy’ will succeed outgoing Taoiseach Leo Varadkar Promising to “hit the ground running” and to “match vision with action”, the new Fine Gael leader Simon Harris pledged to “fix housing once and for all” in his first ardfheis speech since his recent election. Mr Harris was enthusiastically received by more than 1,000 delegates at the University of Galway this evening where he promised “a new energy” – the theme of the ardfheis – would succeed outgoing Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Mr Harris is scheduled to be elected taoiseach when the Dáil meets after the Easter recess on Tuesday morning. “Next week I will be nominated for election as taoiseach,” Mr Harris said in his televised address on Saturday evening. “If given this great honour, I will take office when time is short but there is much to do. Tonight, I promise you, I’m gonna hit the ground running.” Mr Harris said he would “stand by our values as a party and our vision as a nation. A tolerant, inclusive and outward-looking society, which is fair, caring and secure. I am going to match that vision with action.” Mr Harris said he was drawn to join Fine Gael because of the party’s “fundamental values”, which he said were “Hope. Enterprise. Equality of opportunity. Integrity. Security. That is the Fine Gael I intend to lead, with a new energy.” He said that Fine Gael seeks to protect the economy “because you cannot deliver the services that matter to people without a strong economic foundation”. “It is now time,” he said, “to convert that economic success into real and tangible improvements for all of our people”. Mr Harris made no mention of his Coalition partners but it was possible to detect a distancing from the Green Party when he told delegates: “I want to say to farmers and to rural Ireland, Fine Gael will never talk down to you on climate action. We will sit down and work with you and for you.” There were few policy commitments in Mr Harris’s address, though he promised to extend housing supports and extend tax credits for renters. He also pledged to build 250,000 homes over the next five years. He also promised a package for small businesses and a plan to help farmers “within the next six weeks to act on what we have heard”. Mr Harris also promised to reduce USC on lower- and middle-income earners and said Fine Gael would publish a “five-year tax strategy” later this year. There were nods to education, healthcare, disability care and law and order, on which he promised a “a Dublin city centre taskforce bringing together the council, retailers, business, community groups and gardaí to chart a path towards a safer and vibrant Dublin”. He also promised a “firmer system” for dealing with migration and asylum. Mr Harris had strong words on Gaza, which he described a “humanitarian catastrophe”. While condemning the Hamas attacks in October, he said: “We cannot stay silent on the actions of Israel either. Reason has been replaced by revenge and by the bombing, maiming and death of children. “Anyone who can countenance deliberate starvation has lost their humanity. Prime minister Netanyahu, the Irish people could not be clearer. We are repulsed by your actions.” He added: “I reiterate Ireland stands ready to recognise the state of Palestine” but gave no further details.",0,1
2024/4/6,"Kate O’Connell: Varadkar’s decision to stand down was ‘end of dark enough chapter in my life’   Outgoing Taoiseach says he ‘only wishes’ former Fine Gael TD ‘the very best in her life and political career’ Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has expressed warm wishes for former Dublin Bay South TD Kate O’Connell who described his decision to stand down as the “end of a dark enough chapter in my life”. Mr Varadkar, attending his final Fine Gael ardfheis as Taoiseach, said: “I only wish Kate O’Connell the very best in her life and her political career.” Mr Varadkar and the former TD had a difficult relationship that became a public chasm after Ms O’Connell described a group of the then party leader’s close supporters as “choirboys”. Elected to the Dáil on her first attempt in 2016, Ms O’Connell advocated for the National Children’s Hospital and campaigned to remove the ban on abortion. She lost her seat in the 2020 election and did not go for selection for the byelection following the resignation of former minister Eoghan Murphy. Attending her first ardfheis for a number of years, Ms O’Connell said she was there to support Simon Harris and that “I think he’s going to be a great leader”. She believed the party “has gone through a difficult enough period, perhaps a period of inertia. Ireland has gone through a difficult time and I think Simon Harris is the change Ireland needs”. Asked what her reaction was when she heard Mr Varadkar was planning to stand down, she said she was “surprised, and I was shocked”. She said that “for me personally I felt it was the end of a dark enough chapter in my life and the start of perhaps something new”. She said she would support local and European election candidates, and “I just want to be available to Simon Harris as a Fine Gael person, to help him rebuild the party and help him regain the seats that we lost in 2020”. Ms O’Connell signalled, however, that she would be interested in running again for the party, saying of Mr Harris’s leadership that “it does open an avenue for me”. Cllr James Geoghegan, who unsuccessfully ran in the byelection to succeed Mr Murphy in 2021, has been selected to contest the general election in Dublin Bay South, where Fine Gael currently has no TD. Asked for his response to Ms O’Connell’s view that his departure represented “the end of a dark enough chapter” in her life, Mr Varadkar said: “I only wish Kate O’Connell the very best in her life and her political career.” Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe defended Mr Varadkar’s leadership and said that Fine Gael’s history under the Taoiseach “will be a chapter in which we’ll be able to make a case for the work of Leo leading our country through a pandemic, leading our country through Brexit, leading our country through the economic effects of a war and a surge in migration”. Mr Donohoe said that he saw Mr Varadkar’s leadership as “a really bright phase in Fine Gael and a period in which Leo played a leadership role that befits the office of the Taoiseach in responding to some of the greatest challenges Ireland has ever faced”. When asked if he would welcome Ms O’Connell’s return and her possible run in the general election, he said “I’m not going to comment on who could be candidates of Fine Gael in the future”.",0,1
2024/4/8,"O’Neill says it is ‘business as usual’ for Stormont in aftermath of Donaldson resignation On last official day in office, Taoiseach cautions against future collapses of Stormont at North South Ministerial Council meeting Stormont First Minister Michelle O’Neill has insisted it’s “business as usual” for the power-sharing Executive in the aftermath of the political upheaval caused by Jeffrey Donaldson’s resignation as DUP leader. The Sinn Féin vice president made her remarks after co-chairing the first meeting of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in almost three years on Monday. Flanked by outgoing Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly and Tánaiste Micheál Martin at a press conference in the council’s joint secretariat offices in Armagh, Ms O’Neill said there was a “huge opportunity” to “work collaboratively across the island” on key projects in the wake of the resumption of the institutions. She described the NSMC as a “crucial part of the jigsaw in terms of the infrastructure around the Good Friday Agreement”. In what was his last official day in office, Mr Varadkar spoke of his confidence in the restored Executive to withstand the political crisis triggered by Mr Donaldson’s shock departure last month over historical sexual offences. It has been reported that the former DUP leader intends to strenuously contest the charges he is facing. The Taoiseach cautioned against further collapses of Stormont, which was down for two years due to a DUP boycott over post-Brexit trading arrangements. “Events happen in politics, whether it’s changes in leadership, there’ll be elections for the House of Commons, there’ll be elections for the Dáil all within the next year, and what’s really important is that institutions should be able to function through them and withstand any disruption that may occur,” Mr Varadkar told reporters. “And that’s happened in the past, and I’m sure it can in the future. “And I know from my experience, having served in Government for quite some time and having observed the institutions functioning and not functioning, what we know is that whenever they fall, they tend not to be re-established for many years. “And I think we should always bear that in mind and make sure that we don’t see another break happen.” Major infrastructure projects, including Casement Park, the A5 road and Narrow Water Bridge, were among those discussed by Ministers during the meeting which Ms O’Neill said was “productive” around their shared priorities. The council is the primary North-South political body created under the 1998 Belfast Agreement. Asked if she was concerned about the future of the North’s devolved Government, which was restored in February, Ms O’Neill responded by saying that after immediately after the press conference she planned to quickly travel back to Belfast for the resumption of Assembly “because we’ve much business to do”. She added that an Executive meeting was planned later this week. “It is business as usual as far as the Executive is concerned,” she said. “We’re here today as joint heads of Government to be part of the North South Ministerial Council meeting, and what the public deserve and want is leadership, and we’re prepared to provide that leadership. “We’ve spoken to all Executive colleagues, everybody was here today to play their part in terms of their own ministerial responsibility.” Ms Little-Pengelly said she was determined to provide stability to ensure the Executive could continue in a “positive tone” and pledged her support for the DUP interim leader, Gavin Robinson. “We have an important number of weeks coming up where we’ll be discussing the draft programme for government and the budget. Those are two key documents in terms of the agenda for Government,” she said. Mr Martin said there was a “resilience” shown by Executive and Cabinet members at the morning meeting through a joint commitment to the “agenda that was ahead of us on a North-South basis”. “I think stability and certainty are essential for economic development, for foreign direct investment and for cohesion within society,” he said. “And I think that continuity, that certainty, that stability, I think it’s important for the people of Northern Ireland.” The Tánaiste also paid tribute to Mr Varadkar for his “contribution to politics and particularly to the North-South agenda”.",0,1
2024/4/8,"Varadkar’s eclipse by Harris almost complete as Taoiseach resigns at Áras Resignation signals start of Harris’s government which will be officially appointed by President on Tuesday evening Leo Varadkar has been putting a positive spin on his decision to resign as Taoiseach but Monday’s weather ensured he was leaving under a cloud. Mr Varadkar arrived at a dreary Phoenix Park shortly before 6pm to officially tender his resignation as Taoiseach, paving the way for new Fine Gael leader Simon Harris to assume the role. His resignation comes just more than 13 years since he first arrived at Áras an Uachtaráin as minister for transport in the cabinet of then incoming taoiseach Enda Kenny. There is a natural cycle to every taoiseach and just as solar eclipses come round sporadically, so do party leaders periodically fall into the shadow of competitors. Although officially resigned, Mr Varadkar will remain as acting Taoiseach until Mr Harris is appointed by President Michael D Higgins on Tuesday afternoon. A smiling Mr Varadkar arrived at the Áras in advance of schedule to resign, giving a brief wave to damp, shivering reporters after exiting his car. He was followed closely by advisers Bríd Murphy and Nick Miller as well as John Callinan, secretary general of the Department of the Taoiseach, who was present to oversee the formal resignation. Inside, Mr Varadkar handed a letter to Mr Higgins tendering his resignation before having a discussion with the President during a 45-minute visit. Heavy rain returned as Mr Varadkar left the Áras under an umbrella. Mr Varadkar has remained tight-lipped on his future plans since his announcement just under three weeks ago that he would step down for “both personal and political” reasons. He will remain as TD for Dublin West, but beyond that, he previously said he has nothing else lined up “or in mind”. His resignation came after his final official engagement which saw him attend a meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in Co Armagh earlier on Monday. When asked in Armagh if he will run as a TD in the next general election, he told reporters he will decide after the summer, adding that he looks forward to a “good summer break” following the local and European elections in June. “I haven’t taken more than two consecutive weeks off since 1996 so I’m looking forward to having a decent summer break and will make that decision then,” he said. In parting comments in the North, Mr Varadkar also expressed hope that negative perceptions of him among some unionists will be reassessed in the future. Asked if he thought unionist criticism of him was fair, he said: “I would hope perhaps in a few years’ time, with the fullness of time, when things look a bit different, with hindsight, that might be reassessed. “I spent a huge amount of my time as Taoiseach trying to make sure that [Brexit] didn’t create a hard border between North and South and didn’t adversely affect Ireland’s position in the European Union,” he said. First elected as a TD for Dublin West in 2007, Mr Varadkar was appointed by former taoiseach Enda Kenny as minister for transport in 2011 before then becoming minister for health in 2014. He beat Simon Coveney to become leader of Fine Gael in 2017 and became the youngest person to take up the role of Taoiseach which he held on to for seven years in total. His resignation signals the beginning of Mr Harris’s government which will be officially appointed by Mr Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin on Tuesday evening when all eyes will be on his cabinet reshuffle.",0,1

2024/4/9,"Election of Simon Harris as Taoiseach a chance to ‘reset relationships’, says DUP chief Gavin Robinson says new leader a chance for Dublin Government ‘to learn from missteps of  previous administration, which gravely damaged southern relationship with unionists’ The election of Simon Harris as Taoiseach is an opportunity to “learn from the missteps of the previous administration” and “reset relationships” between unionists and the Irish Government, the DUP interim leader has said. Gavin Robinson congratulated Mr Harris on his appointment and said he looked forward to engaging with him “in due course”. Addressing members and supporters of the North Antrim DUP Association in Ballymena on Tuesday evening, Mr Robinson said “the Republic of Ireland is our nearest neighbour, and I want us to be good neighbours with sensible co-operation”. “This is an opportunity for the Dublin Government to learn from the missteps of the previous administration, which gravely damaged the southern relationship with unionists,” he said. The former taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, was accused by unionists of threatening violence – which he vehemently denied – during the Brexit negotiations, when he used the example of the bombing of a customs post during the Troubles to emphasise to Brussels why there could not be a hard border on the island of Ireland. He was also criticised for his support for a united Ireland, a potential pressure point which Mr Harris has already kicked into the long grass, saying to Sky News earlier this week that it was a “legitimate aspiration, but not a priority”. Mr Robinson said Northern Ireland was a “divided society, and progress has only ever been made through consensus”. Unsurprisingly, other Northern parties also emphasised the need for the new Taoiseach to maintain strong North-South links. The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, welcomed the new Taoiseach’s “abiding interest in the North”, and said he looked forward to working with him “to strengthen North South co-operation, which has suffered as a result of the suspension of devolution in the North, to build on the work of the Shared Island unit, and to continue the important work of bringing the people and traditions that share our island together”. The leader of the Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said she wished Mr Harris “all the best” in his new role. “The tenure of his predecessor Leo Varadkar saw a close and productive working relationship further progressed between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and I am confident Mr Harris will continue to nurture this positive partnership between the North and South,” she said. Meanwhile, although Westminster is practically deserted due to the ongoing parliamentary recess for Easter, Britain’s prime minister Rishi Sunak and the man vying to replace him, Labour leader Keir Starmer, congratulated Mr Harris within moments of each other on Tuesday afternoon. The Labour leader was first out of the traps, writing on Twitter/X that he  looked forward to working with the Taoiseach “as we seek to strengthen the ties of friendship between our two countries”. Exactly two minutes later, Mr Sunak took to the social media platform with a similar message. The prime minister said he looked forward to “forging even stronger ties” with his Irish counterpart “so we can deliver for people across these isles”. From Edinburgh, Scotland’s first minister Humza Yousaf took time out from an exceptionally difficult day, during which his wife’s brother was charged with involvement in an alleged abduction, to send his “warmest congratulations” to Mr Harris. “There can be no greater honour than leading the country you love,” he said. Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission president, also sent her congratulations to the new Taoiseach. “We will work hand in hand to deliver for the people of Ireland, and for Europe as a whole,” she said. Mr Harris is due to travel to Brussels on Thursday, where he will meet  Dr von der Leyen, as well as Roberta Metsola, the Maltese politician who is president of the European Parliament. The Taoiseach’s first  engagements will come ahead of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels next week, which is expected to discuss plans to make the union more competitive economically. “I had very productive discussions with the Taoiseach, in his previous role, about growing links between United States and Ireland in the higher education sector and about deepening our research collaboration,” US ambassador to Ireland Claire Cronin said in a statement. “As we mark 100 years of diplomatic relations, I look forward to working with the Taoiseach to further strengthen the partnership between our countries and the friendship between our people.”",0,1
2024/4/9,"Ireland will soon formally recognise state of Palestine, Tánaiste tells Dáil Ireland and some other EU states to announce formal recognition of Palestine once peace initiative is underway Ireland will shortly formally recognise the State of Palestine, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has told the Dáil. Speaking on Tuesday evening in a debate on the appointment of the new Cabinet, following the election of Simon Harris as Taoiseach, Mr Martin said that the approach of delaying recognition “is not credible or tenable any longer”. He said he had been in discussions about recognition with other countries involved in peace initiatives in Gaza, adding: “It is my intention to bring to Government a formal proposal on recognition when these wider international discussions are complete. “But be in no doubt recognition of a Palestinian State will happen.” It is understood that Ireland and some other EU states will announce formal recognition of Palestine once a peace initiative – expected in the coming weeks – is under way. Sources were reluctant to put a date on this but said it would be “sooner rather than later” and was a matter of weeks rather than months. “For the past six months I have maintained ongoing discussions with ministerial colleagues in other countries about how a joint formal recognition of Palestinian statehood could be a catalyst to help the people of Gaza and the West Bank and in furthering an Arab led peace initiative,” Mr Martin said. “We have agreed that the undermining of the Oslo Accords and therefore the agreement to create two states has reached a point where the Accords’ approach of recognition after a final agreement is not credible or tenable any longer. “I have discussed this with those in the region who are working on peace initiatives and co-ordination with other countries continues intensively,” he said. Mr Martin also said that the he was “in no doubt that war crimes have been committed and I utterly condemn the ongoing bombardment of the Gazan people.” He also took aim at Opposition parties, saying: “There are those here who believe that angry speeches and unilateral action is the answer to everything – but our approach of building international alliances through the hard work of direct diplomacy will achieve far more for the Palestinian people.” The case for officially recognising Palestine has long been discussed in Government, with successive ministers suggesting that Ireland had no objection in principle and would recognise the Palestinian state when it could contribute to the peace process in the Middle East. However, the war in Gaza has given the issue new impetus and it is understood that Mr Martin has been in discussions with a number of other EU governments on the issue in recent months. While Mr Martin did not give a specific timescale, sources say that the move is likely to come “within weeks” and will be announced as part of a multilateral peace initiative to end the war in Gaza. Mr Martin has recently been in discussions with the foreign ministers of Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and well as “like-minded EU countries”, including Slovenia, Malta and Belgium. At last month’s EU summit in Brussels, former taoiseach Leo Varadkar met with the prime ministers of Spain, Slovenia and Malta after which they issued to statement declaring their “readiness to recognise Palestine,” adding they stand ready to do so “when it can make a positive contribution and the circumstances are right.”",0,1

Likewise Simon Coveney, who will step down as Minister for Enterprise on Tuesday, will be entitled to similar severance payments totalling €236,000. A TD who steps down from Cabinet is entitled to a maximum of 14 months salary as a termination payment when they retire as TD or fail to get re-elected in a general election. The money, which is taxable, is paid out as a lump sum of two months’ payment and then 12 equal payments over the course of a year. The salary of the Taoiseach has recently risen to €239,000, which would leave Mr Varadkar entitled to payments totalling €279,000 when he leaves the Oireachtas. The money paid would be taxed. The salary of a senior Minister is now €202,000, which would allow Mr Coveney a termination sum €236,000 to be paid over the course of a year. The payments are separate to the ministerial and TDs pensions to which Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney will be entitled once they reach retirement age of 66. As a former taoiseach Mr Varadkar is also entitled to secretarial assistance worth up to almost €60,000 annually, as well as availing of VIP services at Dublin Airport. Former taoisigh have not been entitled to a State car since 2011. However, they can request the use of a State car five times a year. The VIP services have not been used by any former taoisigh. The late John Bruton, a former Fine Gael taoiseach, availed of a State car on only one occasion. Neither Enda Kenny nor Bertie Ahern have availed of the service.",0,1
2024/4/9,"The five landmines that lie ahead for Simon Harris As the election cycle kicks off, the new Taoiseach will have plenty on his plate Local and Europeans election The Fine Gael leader will face his first electoral test in less than 60 days with the local and European elections, so the pressure is on pretty much immediately. The party won 255 seats in the 2019 local election, up 20 seats on the previous election in 2014. While Sinn Féin has seen its poll results flatline slightly in recent weeks it is sure to take considerably more than the 81 seats the party claimed in 2019. Fine Gael is fielding more than 340 candidates this time around, but the party is under pressure locally, with housing, health and immigration topping voters’ concerns in recent months. Then there are the European elections. These can be notoriously hard to predict. The increase in population recorded in the last census resulted in Ireland getting an extra seat, bringing the total to 14. Fine Gael was the big winner in the 2019 European elections, taking five seats out of 13. Holding on to these five seats will be an uphill battle for Harris. Further resignations At least 11 Fine Gael TDs have said they will not contest the next general election, presenting Harris with another headache. There have been suggestions that more resignations could be on the cards. For example, outgoing Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has hinted that he plans to make up his mind about his future in politics over the summer. In a political system that favours incumbency and rewards name recognition, the new Fine Gael leader may find himself having to convince yet more colleagues not to flee the ship. Budget 2025 This will be the last budget of this Government’s term, and so the pressure will be on the new Taoiseach to splash the cash and give the voters a reason to stick with Fine Gael. There has already been resistance within the Coalition from the likes of Minister for Finance Michael McGrath to the idea of a spring package of supports for hard-pressed business owners. Businesses are facing a raft of extra increases because of new measures such as extra sick pay and auto-enrolment pensions, so Harris will have to balance keeping his promise to SMEs, taxpayers and farmers while maintaining a steady hand on the public purse. Immigration Recent poll results from The Irish Times Snapshot series have shown that immigration remains a hot topic with voters. According to the Government’s new strategy to accommodate asylum seekers, the plan is to eventually move away from using hotels and other privately-provided accommodation to State beds. This, however, will take years. By 2028 up to 35,000 beds will be needed to accommodate expected arrivals. However, the continued upheaval across Europe and the possible re-election of Donald Trump in the US could make these projections redundant. General election Harris will face his ultimate test as Fine Gael leader whenever the next general election rolls around. The political wisdom of the moment sees him continue this Government’s term all the way until next March. But with the raft of Fine Gael resignations, he faces into the next general election having lost a team of established vote-getters. He will have to find more candidates – and more female candidates – within the next few months, and will have to somehow convince voters on Fine Gael’s record on the big topics that matter, notably housing. Given record homeless figures he has a fight on his hands.",0,1
2024/5/1,"Seanad passes Bill to prevent anti-abortion protests outside health facilities  Minister for Health says passage of legislation will allow women to access legal health services without fear of intimidation or harassment The Seanad has passed legislation to ensure safe access zones outside clinics to prevent harassment or intimidation of pregnant women seeking a termination. The Health (Termination of Pregnancy Services) (Safe Access Zones) Bill has previously been passed by the Dáil, and will now go to the President to be considered for signature. The Bill will prohibit anti-abortion protests within 100 metres of any facility that could be providing access to terminations. This will allow for exclusion zones around all hospitals, GP practices and other facilities such as the Dublin Well Woman Centre and Irish Family Planning Association services. The legislation was first debated in the Dáil in July last year and passed in November before moving to the Seanad. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said on the passage of the Bill that “today is a significant and memorable day” in which the Government delivered on an important promise, to establish safe access zones for women and service providers right across the country”. He said “safe access zones will now become a reality in our country. Once this Bill is signed into law by the President, it will protect service users and providers. It will allow women in Ireland to access legal health services without fear of intimidation or harassment. Mr Donnelly said “the reality is that our country has a very dark history when it comes to women’s healthcare and women’s reproductive rights”. But this legislation is one important step in “making sure that Ireland is one of the most advanced countries anywhere in the world when it comes to modern, progressive, safe and expert women’s health services”. Northern Ireland Green Party Senator Malachai O’Hara said the passage of the legislation meant that on “the entire island of Ireland we will now end the campaign of harassment and intimidation against women and pregnant people who wish to seek reproductive and sexual healthcare services”. Independent Senator Rónán Mullen, however, described the Bill as a “sad piece of legislation” and added the Minister had nothing to be proud of here. He said Mr Donnelly “has got an easy win for himself by caving in to an activist group and by attacking the peaceful expression of dissent on abortion”. Mr Mullen added that “there is nothing safe about safe access zones. There is nothing safe about what happens to the unborn child in an abortion situation.” And he called on President Michael D Higgins to consult the Council of State “and to see about testing this Bill in an Article 26 reference”. He said if that did not happen “I encourage peaceful protesters to challenge this legislation. People should continue to witness respectfully and not to be intimidated by a Government that wants to silence people”. Sinn Féin Senator Lynn Boylan it was a good day for women’s healthcare. “Women should be able to access healthcare without intimidation and without fear of threat. It is their business what they do with their bodies.” Independent Senator Sharon Keogan said she was a “little disappointed” and would like to see Mr Donnelly “being a Minister for young pregnant girls and women who find themselves pregnant, to encourage them to have their children, and to put down policies that will make their lives better”. In a statement Pro Life Campaign spokeswoman Eilís Mulroy described the Bill as “draconian” and said it “will do nothing to help women in unplanned pregnancies. Instead, it seeks to smear pro-life citizens and introduces sweeping measures which undermine everyone’s fundamental rights.”",0,1
2024/5/1,"Ireland is ‘loneliest place in Europe’ - calls for a Minister specifically to deal with the problem  Some 20% of Irish people report feeling lonely most or all the time compared to European average of 13%  Renewed calls have been made for the State to appoint a Minister with specific responsibility to combat loneliness as it emerged that “Ireland is actually the loneliest place in Europe”. Green Party Senator Pauline O’Reilly said official figures show that 20 per cent of Irish people have reported feeling lonely most or all of the time, the highest level in the EU, where the average is just 13 per cent. “Even the figure of 13 per cent is fairly shocking,” she said, adding that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has a commission on social connection to address loneliness which it has described as a “pressing health threat”. In November 2023, WHO launched a new commission to foster social connections as it declared loneliness a “pressing health threat”. In its Seanad motion the Green Party highlighted the WHO report, and also noted the Canadian Citizens Connections report last year, which stated that 45,000 deaths a year in that country are attributed to loneliness. Ms O’Reilly called for the appointment of a Minister specifically to deal with loneliness. The Greens want every local authority to “prepare a local strategy to combat loneliness through the use of libraries, public buildings, sports partnerships and public participation networks”. And she said loneliness should be measured annually. “We do not want to wait five to six years when this is such a threat to public health.” Her party colleague, Róisín Garvey, called for a commission on loneliness, and said “a quarter of us will be over the age of 65 by 2050. We have smaller families and less reliance on family members. Therefore, loneliness will become much more of an issue. Already more than 5,300 older people reported feeling lonely in 2023.” She noted that the rural organisation Muintir na Tíre does a senior alert scheme to provide monitored panic alarms for over-65s. The organisation noticed a 46 per cent increase in calls since the pandemic from people merely to seek assurance “and for somebody to tell them they are okay”. Green Party Northern Ireland Senator Malachai O’Hara said the Northern Ireland Assembly had a similar debate on Monday, where they “specifically talked about a cross-departmental strategy”. Statistics in the North showed that one in three disabled people talk about experiencing loneliness and “that is a real challenge”. Independent Senator Victor Boyhan called on Minister of State for Public Health Colm Burke to “dust off” a report produced on loneliness by former senator Dr Keith Swanick called A Connected Island – an Ireland free from Loneliness. Mr Boyhan said the report had a number of “important asks and tasks. Needless to say many have not been done”. The Minister acknowledged that loneliness is increasing and said the pandemic was a major contributory factor to social isolation. He added that several studies have linked loneliness to multiple chronic health conditions. But he said the Government had actually introduced many policies and initiatives to promote social including and combat loneliness, including the community mental health fund and the national positive ageing strategy which provides “a blueprint for promoting older people’s engagement in economic, social, cultural and community life”. He added that “we have taken great strides in making Ireland a great place to grow old”, adding that in 2019 the WHO formally designated Ireland the first age-friendly country in the world. Fine Gael Senator Martin Conway expressed concern that people had contact during the pandemic because there was a structure in place but “because we are back to normal these Covid response teams have been stood down”. Independent Senator Eileen Flynn said “we have many action plans to tackle loneliness in this country but we haven’t had any action around these plans”. She said there should be a focus on the “do-able win, the small win in the short-term”. Ms Flynn, who represents the Traveller community, added that “being poor is lonely. Living on a halting site, pushed away from society, that’s lonely.”",0,1
2024/5/1,"Inside the early morning operation to move asylum seekers from Mount Street encampment Government had become increasingly concerned that the area - described by Taoiseach Simon Harris as a ‘makeshift shantytown’ - was expanding rapidly At 5.30am on Wednesday morning, Government officials gathered in what has been described as a “control room” in the city centre to kick-start a plan to relocate more than 200 male asylum seekers from Mount Street to Citywest and Crooksling in southwest Dublin. The decision to move the asylum seekers had been taken at a meeting last Thursday, which was convened by Taoiseach Simon Harris and attended by other Ministers, senior officers from An Garda Síochána and officials from Dublin City Council. “The Taoiseach was emphatic that this issue needed to be addressed, that the situation could not continue. It was the first time that everyone had been brought together like that,” one Government source said. A second Coalition source agreed: “That meeting was certainly the catalyst for action to be taken.” Harris and his officials were becoming increasingly concerned that the tented encampment – which the Taoiseach later referred to as a “makeshift shantytown” – was expanding rapidly and was reaching up to the steps of the European Parliament offices. While they were keen to move quickly, a huge amount of planning had to be done first. There was also considerable anxiety about potentially botching the operation in front of the public and media by creating a rushed or confrontational environment. “We looked at this as a humanitarian mission or effort. These are human beings we are talking about here. The situation was becoming unsafe and unsanitary for those in the tents and for local residents. But officials had to consider a huge amount of different issues before a decision could be made to move,” a Government source said on Wednesday, hours after the move took place. “A few different dates were looked at and different times were considered. Even issues such as the weather had to considered so that it wasn’t an extremely unpleasant experience for those being moved. “We had to make sure there was medical assistance available in case anyone became unwell, we had to make sure the transport was available, and the facilities in Crooksling were ready: things like hot food, a place for the men to charge their devices, a place to wash, sleeping facilities, security for when they are sleeping.” Security guards outside the Crooksling site were masked, in a sign of how fraught the situation has become after recent protests outside sites marked for asylum seekers. It was decided over the weekend that Wednesday would be the day for the move, and from that point onwards daily meetings were held between Government officials to make sure everything was in place. A control room was set up where officials were tasked with acting as point of contacts to liaise with gardaí, translators, transport operators and also teams tasked with clearing away the site. Initially, the Government believed the “humanitarian mission” was a success, but by Wednesday afternoon reports were coming back that, once again, some of the men were looking to leave Crooksling and return to the city centre. In total, 268 single male applicants were offered accommodation at International Protection Accommodation Services sites at Crooksling and Citywest, with 138 applicants offered accommodation at Citywest and a further 130 offered accommodation at Crooksling. The tents outside Mount Street first appeared after the Department of Integration ran out of accommodation last December, and intensive efforts are now under way to ensure there is adequate accommodation for any new arrivals into the city centre. This will be key to stopping further tented sites appearing in the city centre. The Department of Integration has also now put out a tender seeking sites from property owners, private developers and building contractors. In tandem with this, there has been a steady flow of Ukrainian refugees leaving State accommodation, which has provided a modicum of breathing room. The situation is far from resolved, however, as officials cannot rule out a situation whereby the department runs out of accommodation yet again. In the meantime, asylum seekers who attempt to return to Mount Street may find themselves facing garda patrols, fences and even potted plants. Speaking about this prospect, Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said: “I can’t rule out that in any given night, in any given day that people who are in difficult circumstances might erect a tent. “But what I am very confident in is that our State agencies will take all the steps that are needed to try to prevent something of this scale occurring again.”",0,1
2024/5/10,"FF’s Blaney criticises Europe running mate Barry Cowen over call for Border migration checks Donegal senator said he was ‘angered’ by ‘ill-judged’ comments from colleague, who said words were taken out of context A Fianna Fáil candidate in the European elections has sharply criticised comments made by a party colleague running in the same constituency who called for random spot checks on the Border with Northern Ireland for illegal immigrants. In a direct criticism of Offaly TD Barry Cowen, the Donegal senator Niall Blaney has said the comments were “ill-judged” and he was “angered”  a Dáil deputy would suggest that, in the wake of the Belfast Agreement, “this in only a problem on one side of the Border”. Senator Blaney and Mr Cowen are both Fianna Fáil candidates for the Midlands North West constituency. The Mayo senator Lisa Chambers is also a candidate. In an interview with The Irish Times, Mr Cowen called for random spot checks on the Border, expedited decisions around adding extra safe countries of origin and increased deportations. He  said there should be spot checks by gardaí on the Border to detect illegal immigrants, saying “if there is a fear of being caught, the numbers will decrease”. In a statement on Friday morning, Mr Blaney said  people everywhere on the island of Ireland were frustrated by the issue. He said that focusing on the Border between North and South, was “not the way to go”. “We have fought long and hard to get rid of Border controls on this island,” he said. “This is a European problem and one that we should seek to handle in that wider context ... The continuous talk about tents in Dublin is only a small part of our migrant issues. Everything does not revolve around Dublin,” he said. Mr Cowen said on Friday  the Donegal senator was getting “the wrong end of the stick”. He said  specialist Garda immigration officers were empowered to carry out spot checks not only on the Border but all over the country but that the unit was under-resourced. He said he had not been homing in on the Border in his comments.",0,1
2024/5/11,"‘Trailblazer’ former Fine Gael MEP Mary Banotti has died Taoiseach Simon Harris says former Fine Gael presidential candidate was ‘smart, wise and funny’ President Michael D Higgins has led tributes to former Fine Gael politician Mary Banotti, who has died. Ms Banotti, who was 84 and had been unwell, was a Member of the European Parliament for Dublin from 1984 to 2004, and a Fine Gael candidate in the 1997 presidential election. “Mary Banotti made a very significant contribution to Irish life, both in her 20 years of service to the people of Dublin as a Member of the European Parliament, and through the many important causes which she played such an active role in supporting over the course of her life,” said President Higgins. “I had the privilege of personally knowing Mary over a number of decades and had the deepest respect for her principled positions on these important issues. Ms Banotti, the eldest of six from Clontarf, Dublin, worked as a nurse abroad before becoming a politician. A former TV presenter and a co-founder of Women’s Aid, which opened Ireland’s first women’s refuge, she also served as chairperson of the Rutland Centre for Drug Abuse and had a strong interest in healthcare and women’s rights during her political career. “May I extend my deepest sympathies to Mary’s daughter Tania, to her sister Nora Owen and to all of her extended family, and to her many colleagues and friends across Ireland, Europe and beyond,” said the President. An Taoiseach Simon Harris has said it was with great sadness that he has learned of the death of Ms Banotti. “Mary was a talented politician, a trailblazer and a joy to be around,” Mr Harris said. “She was smart, wise and funny.” She also took a strong interest in the environment, helping to raise the profile of the issue of the environment in European politics, the Taoiseach noted in a statement. “Another area she broke new ground was in her work supporting parentally abducted children in the EU, the first person to hold the official role,” Mr Harris said. “Mary did so much with her life and had so much to be proud of, but she was humble. Her energy was boundless and she always had a nugget of wise political insight or a witty observation.” A grandniece of Michael Collins, she was a sister of Nora Owen, one time deputy leader of Fine Gael. “She was enormously proud of her daughter Tania and my heartfelt thoughts are with Tania, Nora and wider family,” the Taoiseach said. “Mary wrote once that her mother grafted hard to put her six children through education, that she was highly ambitious for them, and that she wanted her children to come out of the top drawer and make something of themselves, Mr Harris said. “Mary Banotti did that, and then some.” Fine Gael MEP Frances Fitzgerald, in a statement, said she was very sad to hear of the passing of Ms Banotti. “Mary was a wonderful person and an upstanding and fearless representative for Dublin and Ireland in the European Parliament for 20 years. She made an enormous impact,” she said. Fine Gael TD for Louth/East Meath, Fergus O’Dowd, said Ms Banotti “cared about people and believed in a fairer and more just society. May she rest in peace”. Born Mary O’Mahony in Clontarf, Dublin, in May 1939, her mother Kitty was a niece of Michael Collins and moved to Dublin after the family home in Woodfield, Co Cork, was burned by British forces in 1921. Her father Jim, a bank clerk and sometime actor, died when she was 10. She left Ireland in the mid-1950s to train as a nurse in London. Four years later, she moved to the United States and lived in New York, Canada and Kenya, where she worked as an aid worker. She met and married an Italian doctor, Giovanni Banotti. The couple lived in Rhodesia but eventually moved to Rome, where her daughter Tania was born. After the marriage broke up, Ms Banotti and her daughter returned to Dublin in October 1970. She got a job as a nurse with Irish Distillers, at the same time throwing herself into numerous social causes. Having failed to get elected to the government in a 1983 by-election, and in a bid for the Seanad, she was first elected to the European Parliament, representing the Dublin constituency, in 1984. She came second to former president Mary McAleese in the 1997 presidential election.",0,1
2024/5/12,"Review of asylum seeker supports to be completed ‘within weeks’ Analysis under way within Coalition to ensure State offering in line with other European countries A review of supports for asylum seekers will be completed “within weeks”, Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has said. Last week The Irish Times reported that a review of supports offered to asylum seekers is now under way within the Coalition to ensure that the State’s offering is in line with other European countries. Speaking in Dublin on Sunday, Mr Donohoe said the Taoiseach has now “asked for this work to be done quickly”. “We want to ensure we are treating people compassionately and fairly as they come into Ireland seeking refuge. But we also want to ensure that we are acting in a way that is in line with similar offerings, similar decisions that are made across Europe. We recognise that those that are coming to our country seeking refuge are doing so in very difficult and desperate circumstances. But what we want to do is have a firm, clear, rules-based system in place that is compassionate and fair. This work under way and will be done quickly.” “We have a very successful work permits system in place at the moment and we have far more people who come to Ireland legally on work permits than we do those who come to our country on an international protection programme.” Mr Donohoe said the work is being done is to assess and compare Ireland’s offering to other European countries. “We just need to assess that for those coming into Ireland who may need benefits, that it is line with how we see other countries deal with the same issue. What is guiding this is our commitment to make sure that we are making good use of our country’s money and also treating those who are coming to Ireland seeking refuge in a fair and compassionate way.” He later said the work would be complete “within weeks.” He also questioned Sinn Féin’s stance of “opposing open borders”. “What open border are they referring to that they want to see managed differently? Are they referring to the open border on the island of Ireland that I believe politicians all over this country were committed to protecting during the crisis of Brexit? Are they referring to the Border that they would want to see changed between the United Kingdom and Ireland, so are they against the Common Travel Area? Or are they referring to the border within the European Union of the single market that they want to see changed?” Meanwhile, Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik has said she is “concerned” for the welfare of asylum seekers after it emerged on Sunday that gardaí are investigating an alleged attack on tents where homeless international protection applicants are sheltering on Grand Canal. “It’s very concerning. I just heard last night that there was a nasty attack on a group of men who are camping along the canal, a stone’s throw from me. Our local volunteers have reported that to the gardaí, but the reality is that as long as people are forced to sleep in tents along the Grand Canal and in public streets, they will be at risk. It’s insecure by definition. It’s also not good for them: it’s inhumane, there’s no sanitation, there’s no cleaning facilities,” she said. “The Government has failed to provide adequate accommodation for people and that’s what is creating the insecurity because as long as people are camping on the streets, there is insecurity.” She was speaking at the launch of the party’s local and European election campaign. Labour is running more than 100 candidates for the upcoming local elections.",0,1
2024/5/13,"Michael Lowry accountant criticised by Moriarty tribunal gets €371,000 in legal costs Payment to Denis O’Connor comes 27 years after the inquiry was established The Moriarty tribunal has reimbursed some €371,000 in legal costs to an accountant who advised former minister Michael Lowry, despite the tribunal having heavily criticised  his actions. The payment to Denis O’Connor comes 27 years after the inquiry was established. The State Claims Agency made the payment to Mr O’Connor on March 5th, the Department of the Taoiseach said in response to questions. On the same day, the agency paid more than €2.49 million to Mr Lowry, in line with his January statement about the resolution of a long dispute over costs with the tribunal. Mr Lowry had already received €377,244.14 from the tribunal in March 2021, which he said was related to his successful Court of Appeal action against its decision to award him only one-third of his legal costs for participating in the inquiry. The addition of Mr Lowry’s recent €2,498,325.20 payment to €6,150 paid in 2023 and the 2021 payment shows that he has received more than €2.88 million from the tribunal for legal fees. He declined to comment on the money. Although the tribunal made its final report in 2011, it is still not closed. “Arrangements continue for the full and final winddown of the tribunal,” the department said. It said it had “no control over third-party legal costs incurred by the tribunal” so it was “not possible to predict the timing of settlements or the level of such costs at any particular time”. Mr O’Connor did not reply to requests for comment on his claim for “plaintiff legal costs”. The payment to Mr O’Connor came despite stark tribunal criticism of his conduct. He was a key figure in its long investigation into the 1995 award of the State’s second mobile phone licence to Denis O’Brien’s company Esat Digifone, when Mr Lowry was a Fine Gael minister. The licence, one of the most lucrative ever awarded by the State, was at the centre of mammoth inquiries that carried on for years before Mr Justice Michael Moriarty issued damning findings in 2011. Mr O’Brien has always rejected outright the judge’s conclusion that Mr O’Brien gave money to Mr Lowry, who “secured the winning” of the licence for him. Mr Lowry, now an Independent TD, also dismissed the findings. The judge found Mr O’Connor was involved in a “choreographed falsehood” that was “negotiated and orchestrated by Mr O’Connor and Mr Lowry, with the objective of misleading the tribunal” about part of its work. Mr O’Connor was also one of seven witnesses the judge accused of engaging in “persistent and active concealment” which he said was “calculated to obscure from the tribunal evidence indicating monetary connections between Mr Michael Lowry and Mr Denis O’Brien”. An Garda Síochána sent a file in 2017 to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) after investigating the alleged obstruction of the tribunal. The DPP “directed no prosecution”. Some 13 years after the final report, the judge’s other conclusions remain under Garda investigation. “This investigation remains ongoing at this time. No further information is currently available,” the Garda said in response to questions. The Department of the Taoiseach has administrative responsibility for the tribunal. Settlements are processed and paid by the State Claims Agency, with reimbursement then sought from the department.",0,1
2024/5/13,"Legal age for sale of cigarettes to be raised to 21 as decline in smoking rate plateaus  Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to also draft legislation to address the thousands of flavours of vapes The minimum legal age for the sale of tobacco will be increased from 18 to 21 under plans due to be approved by Cabinet this week. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly will bring a memo to Cabinet to increase the legal age, amid concerns about a recent plateau in the decline of smoking rates in Ireland. Separately, Mr Donnelly is also drafting legislation to address the thousands of flavours of vapes and the bright colours of the packaging. Those laws would restrict point of sale promotion and include a ban on disposable vapes. Ministers will be told on Tuesday that raising the minimum legal age for the sale of tobacco products could lead to a significant reduction in smoking prevalence. About 18 per cent of Irish adults currently smoke. Mr Donnelly will outline data which shows that the ages between 18-21 are a time of high risk for becoming a smoker. It is understood that the legislation will be designed so that it does not affect those who are between the ages of 18-21 who are currently legally entitled to be sold tobacco products. The prohibition on the retail sale of tobacco products will not apply to this group for what has been described as a “wash through” period. Health officials are hoping that the age hike could also limit the social sources of cigarettes for children and young people as they may be less likely to be in social groups with people who can legally purchase cigarettes. The Government believes that there may be strong public support for the move, following a survey by the Irish Heart Foundation which found that 73 per cent of adults and 71 per cent of those aged 18-24 supported raising the legal age to purchase tobacco to 21. It comes after legislation was introduced to ban the sale of vapes to children. Under that law, under-18s have not been able to legally buy them since last December. From this September, there will also be curbs on advertising on public transport and near schools as well as a ban on sales at events attended by children. A ban on the sale of tobacco and vape products from vending machines is also to be enacted shortly, while a new licensing regime will mean all shops selling these products will have to pay an annual licence.",0,1
2024/5/13,"Retail and hospitality businesses in line for cash injection worth thousands  New enterprise support package expected to be approved by Cabinet on Tuesday Retail and hospitality businesses could be set for a “cash injection” worth thousands of euro as part of a new enterprise support package being considered by the Government. Ministers were putting the finishing touches to the plans over the weekend, with the final package due to be approved by Cabinet on Tuesday. Taoiseach Simon Harris pledged to unveil a range of supports for businesses when he took up office last month, and Government sources have confirmed that a key plank of the plan will come in the form of additional grants for the hospitality and retail sector. While talks were ongoing with the Department of Public Expenditure over the weekend it is understood that leftover funding from an existing €257 million scheme to support businesses could be used to give a cash injection to the sectors worst hit by the increased cost-of-living and doing business. Under the Increased Cost of Business scheme businesses can claim 50 per cent of last year’s rates bill up to €10,000, giving business owners a maximum grant of €5,000. Under fresh plans a second round of the scheme could give eligible businesses in the retail and hospitality sector a second grant of up to €5,000. “It now looks likely that an immediate double payment of the cost of doing business grant to those who qualify in hospitality and retail is the quickest way of getting more cash to small businesses,” a senior Government source said. ”If you already applied and got the grant, you can get same again. If you didn’t apply yet you can get double.” There will also be a separate measure worth €50 million to increase the PRSI threshold for employers. At present an employer who pays someone up to €441 a week pays an employers PRSI rate of 8.8 per cent, and as soon as the employee goes above that income the rate goes up to 11.05 per cent on all of the income. The minimum wage was increased to €12.70 this January but the PRSI threshold for the higher rate did not move up to €495. This means that employers paying a minimum wage for a 39 hour week are paying the higher 11.05 per cent rate. The threshold will now be moved up to that €495 level which could save businesses hundreds of euro every week, a source said. Ministers are also mulling over a decision to pause future increases to the number of sick days an employee can take. It had been planned that workers would be entitled to seven statutory sick leave days from next January, up from five. This was then supposed to increase to 10 days in 2026. Further increases to the national minimum wage could also be phased in at a slower pace. One Government source said this plan, however, would be subject to decisions made by the Low Pay Commission. Furthermore, a €1.5 billion surplus in the National Training Fund could also be used to improve incentives for employers to take advantage of education and training for their employees. The new plans will be brought to Cabinet by Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke after talks with a number of different departments. Mr Burke revealed earlier this month that of the 125,000 businesses that could qualify for the increased cost of business grant, only over 50 per cent had actually applied. Sources within Government said there is particular concern around the hospitality sector, and that decisions to provide a cash injection come after figures showed an increase in the number of those businesses becoming insolvent. A PwC report earlier this year found that the hospitality sector was “feeling the pressure”, followed by retail, with these two sectors accounting for 89 – or 40 per cent – of all insolvencies in the first quarter, up from 68 in the same period last year.",0,1
2024/5/13,"Immigration: Ireland needs ‘effective deportations’ and increased workplace inspections - Harris Taoiseach says ‘common sense’ changes to migration policy needed in Ireland Workplace inspections for migrants working illegally need to increase, the Taoiseach has said. Simon Harris said there are a number of “common sense” changes to migration policy that need to be implemented in Ireland. The Government has faced criticism for failing to accommodate all asylum seekers amid an increase in the number of arrivals. There are more than 1,700 male international-protection applicants who have not yet received an offer of State-provided accommodation. In the last two weeks, the Government has directed multi-agency operations to clear large makeshift migrant encampments from Dublin city. There have also been protests in towns and villages across the country over buildings being selected to house asylum seekers. A number of properties have also been severely damaged in suspected arson attacks. Speaking on Monday, Mr Harris said that there was a need to be “honest” that Ireland can continue to provide shelter to asylum seekers but may not necessarily be able to provide housing. He said: “Irish people are full of compassion, but you know what they’re also full of is common sense. “And  what they want to see when it comes to migration policy is compassion and common sense aligning. “They want us to be honest to people coming to this country about what we can and can’t do. “We can absolutely provide shelter but not necessarily housing for people who come here.” The Taoiseach said Government “needs to do better” on accommodating asylum seekers through the use of State land as well as the provision of tents and sanitation facilities. He also said there was a need to focus on faster processing times, “effective deportations”, and integrating people who have a right to remain in Ireland. Speaking to Newstalk, Mr Harris said: “We need to look at welfare consistency, we need to look at a contribution that people who have status make to accommodation. “We need to look at making sure that anybody in work is working legally, that there are more workplace inspections. “There are a number of common-sense things we should do but crucially we need to work at a European level.” Minister for Finance Michael McGrath said the Government was “learning as we go”, when it came to dealing with the large increases in asylum applicants in recent years. Speaking on Monday, he said: “Ireland is not unique in trying to grapple with a very serious immigration challenge and we are responding in the best way we can. “The numbers have continued to grow so the scale of the challenge is increasing all the time. And that’s why the response of the Irish Government has had to change as well,” Mr McGrath said. “It is true that we are learning as we go as well, from the experience. “The key focus now will be on ensuring faster processing of applications so that people who have legitimate entitlement to remain in Ireland get that decision quickly. But others who do not have a right to remain in the country that they get that decision and that that is executed as well quickly, so they can move on,” he said. – Additional reporting PA",0,1
2024/5/14,"Sipo investigation into Robert Troy to go ahead next month Former Minister of State resigned in August 2022 over failing to register all his property interests The Standards in Public Office (Sipo) commission  will next month commence an investigation into former Fianna Fáil minister Robert Troy under ethics legislation. The investigation will look into the alleged failure by Mr Troy to declare all his property ownership in annual declarations setting out his interests. An investigation hearing by Sipo under the Ethics in Public Office Act will take place on June 10th. Mr Troy resigned as a minister of State in the Department of Enterprise in August 2022 following a series of media disclosures that he had failed to register all his property interests. Sipo subsequently appointed an inquiry officer to examine the matter and, on the basis of that report, the commission decided last year to proceed with an investigation under section 23 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 into the omissions. However, a second line of inquiry into a suggested conflict of interest between Mr Troy’s public statements on the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) and the fact he was receiving RAS payments from some tenants will not proceed into a full investigation. Mr Troy’s resignation on August 25th, 2022, came in the wake of week of intense scrutiny of his property interests after the online media outlet The Ditch reported he had failed to declare all his properties. Under mounting pressure, Mr Troy admitted to making errors in his returns over a number of years and also disclosed that he had ownership interests in a total of 11 properties. He claimed at the time that his failure to declare properties was as a result of a misinterpretation of the requirements. Mr Troy made wide-ranging amendments to the Oireachtas register of members’ interests going back to 2013 and apologised for his omissions. In a statement last year, Mr Troy said he welcomed the finding by the Sipo inquiry officer that there was no prima facie evidence to support any conflict of interest arising from his public statements on the RAS scheme during his time as a minister. He also said had noted the decision by the commission to proceed with the investigation in relation to omissions in his declarations.",0,1
2024/5/14,"Ukrainian refugees to have welfare allowances cut from €232 per week to €38.80, under new plan Jim O’Callaghan says Government could designate Northern Ireland a safe third country after Belfast judgment Ukrainian refugees who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 face having their allowances cut, within three months, from the full jobseekers’ rate of €232 per week to €38.80 per week. A memo to be considered by Cabinet on Tuesday will put many of the 100,000 beneficiaries of temporary protection who arrived during the first two years of the war, and who are not working, on the same level of allowances as those who have arrived since March this year. There will be a 12-week lead in time to allow the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Minister for Social Protection to give notice to the people affected. The change is one of a number contained in a memo to Government designed to tighten up migration measures. The memo, brought by Taoiseach Simon Harris, will also involve a review of entitlements of international protection applicants, an increase in workplace inspections for illegal employment and a further review of the list of safe countries. It comes after the High Court in Belfast ruled that parts of the UK government’s Illegal Migration Act do not apply in Northern Ireland. The ruling led to claims it could cause an increase in the number of asylum seekers crossing the Irish Sea. The court ruled on Monday that provisions of the Act would undermine human rights protections guaranteed under post-Brexit arrangements. The Act provides new means to deal with people who have entered Britain illegally. Central to it is a scheme to transfer asylum seekers to Rwanda to have their applications processed. DUP leader Gavin Robinson said the striking down of parts of the Act in Northern Ireland would make it a “magnet” for asylum seekers seeking to escape the Rwanda policy. In Dublin, the Fianna Fáil TD Jim O’Callaghan said the likelihood was that the numbers applying for international protection in the Republic would increase as there would be a rise in those travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland to avoid being sent to Rwanda. “Asylum seekers in the North can be treated no less preferably than those in the Republic,” he said. “The arrival of more asylum seekers on the island of Ireland will inevitably mean more will apply for international protection in the Republic.” Mr O’Callaghan, a TD for Dublin Bay South, also suggested there was now “nothing to stop Ireland from designating Northern Ireland as a safe third country to where asylum seekers could be returned”. Mr Robinson said the UK government had allowed an immigration border to be created in the middle of the Irish Sea, knowing the likelihood that such a judgment would be made. “It is imperative that immigration policy applies equally across every part of the United Kingdom,” Mr Robinson said. British prime minister Rishi Sunak responded by saying the ruling would have no implications for the UK government’s controversial Rwanda policy. “Nothing will distract us from that or delivering to the timetable I set out [to begin transfers to Rwanda],” Mr Sunak said. A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs said it “was studying the judgment carefully”. Privately, Government officials in Dublin said it was unclear if the ruling would lead to a reduction in the numbers of asylum seekers travelling South from Northern Ireland. One person familiar with the system said that the motivation for asylum seekers to come here is complex, involving factors such as the speed of processing of their application, language, welfare benefits and social networks. Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín said the corollary of more people travelling to Northern Ireland to avoid being transferred to Rwanda was that more people would also cross the Border and seek asylum in the South. “The Irish Government must now engage with the British government to ascertain how that will be managed. The loud-hailer diplomacy that happened before the English local elections will not cut it,” Mr Tóibín said. “The Common Travel Area is key to both countries. It won’t work if both counties operate radically different immigration policies.” Speaking on Monday, Taoiseach Simon Harris said that the Government would look at “welfare consistency”, the possibility of those people with status to make contributions to the cost or their State-provided accommodation and to allow more workplace inspections to ensure that people were working legally. “We want to help people but we also want to know that the system is fair,” Mr Harris said on Newstalk Radio. Mr Harris also signalled that the capacity of the Government at present was to provide shelter for people, but not housing. “We can absolutely provide shelter but not necessarily housing for people who come here,” he said. Thornton Hall in north Dublin is one of the sites under consideration for use as emergency tented accommodation, as are a number of other sites owned by the Office of Public Works and the Health Service Executive.",0,1
2024/5/14,"Renewable energy ‘insufficient’ to meet data centre demands with need to ‘ration’ connections to them, Minister told Data centres use vast quantities of electricity and there have been calls for a moratorium on such facilities The State’s renewable energy availability will be “insufficient” to meet all data centre demands up to 2030 and there is a need to “ration” electricity connections for such centres, new Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke has been told. Data centres use vast quantities of electricity and there have been calls for a moratorium on such facilities amid concern over their impact on the grid and efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The issue of data centres has also been contentious within Government and was at the centre of a row earlier this year between Minister for Environment Eamon Ryan and Mr Burke’s predecessor as minister for enterprise, Simon Coveney. Newly published briefing material – provided to Mr Burke by his department when he took office last month – includes a section on data centre policy. It outlines how there are about 80 data centres in the country and that they “underpin other valuable investment in Ireland by the technology sector”. However, the briefing document adds: “The economic benefit must be balanced against energy security considerations and our carbon commitments. “Over the period from now to 2030, renewable energy availability will be insufficient to meet all the data centre demands above and beyond those already connected (including those contracted but not yet connected).” The “current position” is said to be that “a clear and objective way to ration connections is needed if we are to maintain credibility and provide certainty to the sector during the transition period to 2030″. A note elsewhere in the document states that work is under way on a new large energy user (LEU) connections policy and this is being led by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU). A CRU statement said it is preparing a “decision paper”, expected to be completed before the end of the summer, that “will set out the new connections process for LEUs”. The Irish Times reported in March that Mr Ryan was seeking a change in Government policy that would block any future data centres that did not have their own carbon-neutral sources of energy. This was opposed by Mr Coveney who pointed out it had not been agreed as Government policy at a Cabinet economic committee meeting two weeks previously. The Department of Enterprise did not respond directly when asked for Mr Burke’s view on Mr Ryan’s proposal. Instead it referred to a Government statement that sets out the position for data centre developments The department said the Government has a “preference” for data centres that can demonstrate “a clear pathway to decarbonise and ultimately provide net zero data services”. Asked about work taking place to identify a way to ration data centre connections, a Department of the Environment statement referred to the CRU’s review of LEU connections policy. It also said: “Aligned to the CRU review... the department is committed to working with key stakeholders, including IDA and industry, to identify and support new approaches to integrating large-scale demand sustainably into Ireland’s energy systems that align with the energy security requirements to reduce fossil fuel demand.” The department also said Ireland is “planning for a massive expansion in low-carbon energy” that will “provide for an increase in available power by 50 per cent from 2020-2030″.",0,1
2024/5/14,"Ukrainian woman ‘honoured’ to stand in local elections in Co Kerry Natalya Krasnenkova says she ‘would like to become a voice for the new communities in Kerry County Council’ A 46-year-old Ukrainian woman will become the first in an estimated 10,000-strong Ukrainian community in Co Kerry to run in the local elections. Ukrainians living on temporary protection in the State can vote in local elections and can also seek election. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage last September confirmed both the right to vote and to run under the Local Government Act 2001 (as amended). There had been a rush by candidates of all parties to get Ukrainians to register in the various municipal districts. The large Ukrainian community of more than 3,000 in Killarney now have their own candidate. Natalya Krasnenkova is a former television reporter who had her own public relations company in Kyiv for many years before fleeing the war in March 2022. She has built a high profile among the Ukrainian and wider community in Kerry. She is employed as a community development worker for North East West Kerry Development, where she helps Ukrainians every day in matters of integration, employment, learning English and organising leisure and cultural projects. She is also involved in mountaineering, writes a column for a local free paper and has participated in podcasts on immigration for Radio Kerry. She arrived with her son and her daughter, both teenagers, over two years ago. Her daughter has since returned to Ukraine to go to university. While she will target the 3,000-strong mostly adult Ukrainian community, Natalya wants to become a voice for all. “I would like to become a voice for the new communities in Kerry County Council. In Ireland, about 12 per cent of the population has a migrant background, but only 1 per cent is represented in the Government. It would be good to change this tradition. She notes that Kerry County Council has only five female representatives, which she says seems like a disproportionately low number when there are 28 male councillors. “I will be happy to represent the women’s community as well,” she said. An energetic activist, she has not stood still. Last year she finished a course at Kerry College, graduating in “community development and leadership”. She has also completed a course provided by the Migrant Leadership Academy of the Immigrant Council of Ireland. “In my free time, I do light athletics at a local club, I regularly participate in the Killarney park run, and I also like to conquer mountain peaks,” she said. There are growing tensions around immigration issues in Killarney, where about 36 per cent of hotel and guest house accommodation is used by refugees. Kerry Independent TD Danny Healy-Rae last week spoke in the Dáil about Ukrainians driving “flashy SUVs and high-powered cars” and returning to their native country on holiday to houses “we were told were bombed and blown out of existence”. His comments suggest that the migration issue might be raised on doorsteps in Kerry during this election campaign, particularly in light of the large number of refugees living in tourist accommodation in a county that relies heavily on the tourism industry. Ms Krasnenkova said it was important to remember that Ukrainians were well off in their home country and most want to work in Ireland. She disputed Healy-Rae’s characterisation of her compatriots in Kerry. “I did not see large Ukrainian cars. I have an Audi A1, the smallest car in Kerry. I do not have any benefits in Ireland at the moment, apart from the right to work and temporary protection. I pay my taxes,” she said. She stressed that Ukrainians were “not economic refugees or refugees from poverty” and that about half of Ukrainians in Kerry have “higher education – they are business people, doctors, teachers, lawyers”. “It is quite likely that they had a high standard of living in Ukraine, so they could buy cars. We don’t have official figures but thousands upon thousands of people have been killed, that’s what we have sought refuge from, not to look for handouts from Ireland,” she said. Natalya says it is “an honour” to be able seek election. If elected, she will serve the community for five years “and do what is right for Kerry”. She now sees her future in Killarney and wants to continue her humanitarian work in Kerry. “When I arrived in Ireland in March 2022, I hoped that by summer the war would be over and I would be home. Time moved on into autumn, then Christmas,” she said. “The last two years have taught me that the future is uncertain but I can no longer wait for the war to be over. I can try to fulfil what I see as my life’s mission here.” She notes that, as the war continues in Ukraine, 18 per cent of its territory is occupied by Russia and rocket attacks happen throughout the country. “There are more than six million Ukrainian refugees around the world, 10,000 of them in Kerry. Ukrainian cities are bombarded by shelling and ballistic attacks every day,” she says. Her success in the election will depend on how well she can “mobilise” the Ukrainian community, she believes.",0,1
2024/5/15,"Delays in prosecution of suspect in death of Pte Seán Rooney to be pursued by Tánaiste during Lebanon visit Donegal man (24) was killed in an attack on a convoy of Irish peacekeepers in December 2022 Delays in the prosecution of the sole suspect in custody in respect of the death of Pte Seán Rooney are to be pursued by the Tánaiste when he visits Lebanon this weekend. Speaking at the annual conference of Defence Forces representative body PDForra in Cavan on Wednesday, Micheál Martin said he would travel to Lebanon  in the coming days in order to raise the case and visit troops serving as part of the international Unifil peacekeeping force in the south of the country. Pte Seán Rooney (24), from Newtowncunningham, Co Donegal, was killed in an attack on a convoy of Irish peacekeepers in the Lebanese town of Al-Aqbiya in December 2022. Muhammad Ayyad, the only one of five suspects arrested in the wake of the attack, was charged with a number of offences. His trial was delayed last December when his legal representatives said he was too ill to attend and the proceedings were rescheduled until next month. Mr Martin said he wants to see justice done in relation to the incident. “I will be in Lebanon at the weekend and I will be raising that case, the need to progress the case, the need to get justice with ministers of the Lebanese government,” he said. “It will be the focal point of my visit as well as visiting members of our Defence Forces who are now operating in a very challenging and much more difficult environment than heretofore, because of the war in Gaza and the escalating tensions between Israel and Hizbullah..” Asked about the ongoing issues of recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces, Mr Martin said the Government had been moving on a range of issues including the raising of the mandatory retirement age for members, basic pay and investment in facilities and equipment with a view to making the various roles available more attractive. “The retirement age has been increased and will increase to 62, so that will help; the starting pay is close to €40,000 which is comparable to large parts of the public service, after which there are considerable opportunities and we are investing very significantly across every barracks in the country.” During the conference on Wednesday, PDForra’s leadership acknowledged progress has been made, but general secretary Ger Guinan said there were still more than 600 vacancies for privates and more than 400 for corporals or equivalents. There were not enough personnel to properly train new recruits and existing members could not take the time off they were due. Some 120,000 hours of leave hours have been lost during the past five years due to the lack of a system for allowing for it to be taken or payment made in lieu. There is also “simmering anger”, Mr Guinan said, in relation to implementing the recommendation of the Independent Review Group in relation to a new internal grievance procedure despite “the acknowledgment by everyone concerned over a year ago that the current system is unfit for purpose”.",0,1
2024/5/15,"State considers further restrictions on benefits to refugees and people seeking asylum Making conditions here less attractive for migrants now seen as central part of asylum strategy Further restrictions on benefits to refugees and people seeking asylum here are to be considered in the coming weeks as the Government seeks to reduce the numbers arriving and ease pressure on the asylum system. An estimated 27,000 Ukrainians, who are not in work and live in “State-provided serviced accommodation” such as hotels and B&Bs where meals and other services are provided, are likely to be affected by Tuesday’s move. In six weeks’ time they will see benefits reduced from €232 per week to under €39 per week. The Ukrainian embassy responded with dismay to the announcement, warning that a change in social protection entitlements for vulnerable refugees could force them back to Ukraine. “We hope that it will take into account the interests of particular categories of Ukrainian displaced people (elderly, women, children and people with special needs),” the embassy said in a statement. “These categories are most vulnerable as they have difficulties in finding jobs and usually live in rural areas. A significant change in the welfare they get would force them to go back to Ukraine, where the security situation is getting much worse amid Russian counteroffensive in the Kharkiv and Sumy region.” A spokesman for the Government insisted that the cuts were “not an attempt to send Ukrainians home”, but senior figures privately admit that much of the Government’s attention is now directed at reducing the flow of migrants claiming asylum here. Making conditions here less attractive is now seen as a central part of this strategy. “It’s about making the entire migration system sustainable,” the spokesman said. The Government made clear that it will now consider further cuts to the entitlements of refugees and asylum seekers as accommodation pressure again lead to more tents being pitched at the Grand Canal in Dublin by men seeking asylum for whom the State has no accommodation. There are no plans at present to remove the tents, which numbered about 50 on Tuesday evening, the Government said. But efforts are continuing to find venues to where they could be moved. In a statement issued after the Cabinet approved the measures, the Government said that Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman would “review entitlements of international protection applicants and report back to Government within six weeks”. Other measures being examined include fines on airlines, the expansion of the “safe country” list, and curtailing visa-free travel. In addition, Taoiseach Simon Harris indicated that the continued availability of accommodation in direct provision centres for people who have been granted refugee status is likely to be looked at closely. Mr Harris also made clear that the Government is contemplating further cuts in refugee entitlements. “We’re not just reviewing payments,” Mr Harris told reporters, “we’re reviewing the entire kind of range of supports and how the State interacts. So, for example, you have many, many, many people who have status in this country who are through the immigration system and who are still living in free State accommodation without making a contribution.” Meanwhile, official figures seen by The Irish Times show that more than 21,000 international protection applicants are awaiting a first-instance decision on their application despite Government moves to fast-track the cases of people from some countries. Almost 100 people have been waiting more than two years for a first determination on their applications.",0,1
2024/5/15,"‘I have been threatened’: Paschal Donohoe says that he has experienced abuse in public life Some 94% of politicians and 72% of political staff reported some form of threat, harassment, abuse or violence, new survey has found The Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has said that he has been threatened on occasion during his time in public life. Mr Donohoe was speaking as a new survey of Oireachtas members and political staff has found that a vast majority of respondents have experienced some form of abuse. Some 94 per cent of politicians and 72 per cent of political staff who took part in the survey reported that they experienced some form of threat, harassment, abuse or violence, according to a summary of the findings seen by The Irish Times. Speaking on Wednesday Mr Donohoe said that this had happened on a very small number of occasions. He said threats and abuse directed at politicians was “a serious problem,  but it was one that was associated with a small minority of voters and people within the country.” “I have been threatened. But I have been threatened on a very small number of occasions. The overwhelming amount of engagement with the public is as I hope it would be. While the intensity of those threats has, unfortunately, increased, the appreciation and recognition that people have of the role of politicians is unchanged.” “Don’t get me wrong. I am not saying I am greeted with heroic levels of affection anywhere that I go. “But we should not let the threats and attempts to intimidate from a very small number in our country and society colour our view about how politics is conducted overall.” A UCD report on the survey on the abuse and harassment of TDs and Senators and their staff will be launched in Leinster House on Wednesday. A separate report of the Taskforce on Safe Participation in Political Life, which was led by former Garda Commissioner Nóirín O’Sullivan, will also be published. A total of 61 Oireachtas members, or 28 per cent of the 220 TDs and Senators, completed the survey as did 200 of the 580 political staff. The most frequent types of abuse in relation to Oireachtas members was found to be abusive language (52 per cent) followed by prejudicial slurs (38 per cent); comments on physical appearance (35 per cent); and publication of false information (34 per cent). Incidents of abuse resulted in 89 per cent of TDs and Senators that responded and 75 per cent of political staff reporting feeling anxious or afraid. Mr Donohoe said there was “a small number of people that are angrier than they used be, who feel they have licence to say and do things that has not been the case  before”. He suggested that this was “heightened by the pandemic”. “The pandemic and those two years have left an imprint in our society that, I believe, have amplified an anger and feeling about the world from a very small number of people. I have had to contend with that.” “But it comes from a small number of people and the overwhelming majority engage very civilly and really appropriately with politicians and if we don’t continue to acknowledge that, we are going to further diminish the number of people willing to come in to politics. And we will genuinely all be the poorer if we get to that point.” Mr Donohoe said : “We need to protect politicians and our political system from the risks of that small number of people but continue to have an openness and an ability to engage with voters and I believe is a huge strength of Irish politics.” In the report, it found that almost half of the politicians, 49 per cent, increased security at home while 28 per cent of political staff requested increased security at constituency offices. Asked if any specific issues were related to the abuse experienced, Oireachtas members reported immigration (67 per cent); Women’s Rights (47 per cent); housing/homelessness (40 per cent); and LGBTQ+ issues (40 per cent). Statistical tests also indicate a significant association between gender and type of abuse and “in particular, women members of the Oireachtas are more likely to experience digital harassment, to be subjected to prejudicial slurs, to be threatened with sexual violence, to be sexually harassed, to receive unwanted sexual approaches and sexually explicit messages, and more likely to receive comments on their appearance.” One finding of the report is that more targeted efforts should be made to protect politicians from social media-enabled abuse. The Irish Times previously reported that the findings of a draft of the report by Ms O’Sullivan’s taskforce including how tailored security services should be provided by gardaí to politicians and that the Oireachtas should set up a new social media-monitoring unit. Ms O’Sullivan was appointed last summer to lead the cross-party taskforce designed to address the safety of politicians in Ireland, following reporting about the scale of abuse faced by politicians during the course of their work, particularly female politicians.",0,1
2024/5/15,"Head of Defence Forces elected first Irish chair of EU’s highest military body Seán Clancy takes over key post at time of increased regional and global instability and insecurity, attaining four-star general rank The head of the Defence Forces, Lieut Gen Seán Clancy, has been elected as the next chair of the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), the highest military body within the union. The EUMC is composed of the chiefs of defence of the 27 member states, who are regularly represented by their permanent military representatives. It is a three-year, full-time role and is the first time that the committee will have an Irish chair. He will take up this new role in May 2025, taking over from the incumbent chair, Gen Robert Brieger of the Austrian Armed Forces, but will continue to serve as Chief of Staff until that time. It means Lieut Gen Clancy will be promoted to the rank of a four-star general, the highest grade any military officer has had in about a century. There has not been an officer of such rank in the Irish Defence Forces since the 1920s, when Michael Collins, Richard Mulcahy and Eoin O’Duffy held an equivalent rank, although they are not referred to as such in historical records. The Tánaiste and Minister for Defence Micheál Martin said he warmly welcomed Lieut Gen Clancy’s election at a crucial time for Europe, with increased regional and global instability and insecurity. “He brings with him almost 40 years of distinguished military service with the Irish Defence Forces,” Mr Martin said, acknowledging Lieut Gen Clancy’s range of defence experience and his skills in partnership building. “He is ideally suited to apply his abilities to the role of chair of the EUMC at such a crucial time for the military pillar of the EU’s Common Security and defence policy.” The EU’s Military Commttee is the forum for military consultation and cooperation between the EU member states in the field of conflict prevention and crisis management. It directs all military activities within the EU framework, in particular the planning and execution of military missions and operations under the Common Security and Defence Policy and the development of military capabilities. Based on consensus, it provides military direction to the European Union Military Staff. The chair of the EUMC  acts as the spokesperson for the committee, giving voice to military expertise embodied in the committee. On a regular basis, the chair participates in the political and security committee meetings, giving military advice and making recommendations to the group. The chair also acts as the military adviser to the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy , who heads the European External Action Service (EEAS). This extends to attending Council meetings with defence and security implications. The chair also acts as the primary point of contact for the Operation Commanders of the EU’s military operations. The appointment of the chair of the EUMC occurs every three years with each member state having the opportunity to nominate a chair. The other nominees for this election were from Poland and Slovenia. Voting is conducted by secret ballot with each member state casting a first and second preference.",0,1
2024/5/16,"Councillors who lose seats or retire after June election in line for increased ‘retirement gratuity’ payments Level of gratuity will be linked to new higher salary for councillors under Government plans Councillors who lose their seat or retire after June’s local election will be in line for increased “retirement gratuity” payments. Plans to change the system of payments are included in a briefing for the new Minister of State for Local Government Alan Dillon. Under the plans the level of the gratuity is to be linked to the new higher salary that was introduced in recent years rather than the old representational payment for councillors which was lower. The change means a councillor with 20 years’ service will get a maximum payment of €86,172 once they leave office, €8,356 more than the maximum of €77,816 they would have received under the old system. The retirement gratuity is non-contributory so no deductions are taken from  their salaries. There is no pension scheme for councillors and the gratuity, introduced 24 years ago, is paid instead. Councillors who have left office are entitled to the payments once they reach the age of 50 and have at least two years qualifying service. Gratuity payments are also made to councillors who are elected to the Dáil, Seanad or European Parliament once they are over 50. Under the old system calculation of the gratuity was based on the old representational payment which was less than €20,000. The new increased salary for councillors, which stands at €28,724, was introduced in 2021. In the wake of the salary increase, there were calls by councillors and representative organisations like the Association of Irish Local Government for the gratuity to be linked to the new salary. There was a review of the gratuity scheme and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe approved a business case to make changes that was submitted by Mr Dillion’s predecessor as minister Kieran O’Donnell. The new scheme will link the gratuity to the new councillor salary and the accrual rate of the gratuity will be adjusted to a maximum of 300 per cent of the adjusted annual remuneration amount after 20 years. This means that at the current rate of payment  councillors would receive a maximum gratuity of €86,172. The agreed changes require new regulations to be signed by Mr Dillon and Mr Donohoe. A Department of Housing statement said: “The Regulations are not yet signed but will be in place by the local elections on June 7th.” It also said: “Councillors who serve out their full term and retire at the elections in June or who lose their seats will be eligible for the revised gratuity scheme (provided they have served more than two years and are over 50). “If they are under 50, their gratuity is held over until they reach 50.”",0,1
2024/5/16,"State must learn lessons of ‘boom-bust approach’ to public investment, McGrath tells Dáil Dáil passes legislation to create two new funds to deal with future spending pressures and potential economic shocks Ireland has to learn the lessons of the “boom-bust approach to public capital investment”, Minister for Finance Michael McGrath has said as the Dáil passed legislation to create two new funds to deal with future spending pressures and potential economic shocks. He also defended the Government’s approach to the funds as Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty claimed the legislation “is far too rigid, lacks flexibility and risks unintended consequences for the State’s fiscal and economic policy”. Under the Bill a new sovereign wealth fund, the Future Ireland Fund, will be created with 0.8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) generated from corporation tax receipts invested annually, starting this year, to support State spending from 2041 onwards. An annual €2 billion will be invested from 2024 to 2030 in a new Infrastructure, Climate and Nature fund designed to ensure that capital spending is maintained in the event of a future economic shock. The Minister said the Future Ireland Fund and Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund Bill has been “widely commended by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Central Bank of Ireland, the European Commission, the OECD, and a list of ratings agencies and other independent experts, both domestic and international”. He added that “an alarm bell is ringing and we must take heed of it and take on board all of the expert advice that we are getting in that respect”. “The demographics will not look after themselves. These are costs that are coming very quickly in the years ahead. I refer to the cost of an ageing population, healthcare, home care and decarbonisation.” Mr McGrath also said “there is a need to learn the lessons of the past and the boom-bust approach to public capital investment. If we encounter a shock or we have another downturn, which we inevitably will, if we do not set up these funds the response will be to slam the brakes on public spending when it comes to infrastructure. “It is the last thing a government should do. When the economy is weak we should invest through the economic cycle, lean against the wind, invest in housing, transport and all of the infrastructure we need. That is what the second fund does.” Mr Doherty said his party supported the establishment of sovereign funds, particularly a countercyclical investment fund. But he said what mattered was how it was designed and that the legislation “falls short”. The annual investment of 0.8 per cent of GDP, about €4 billion currently, would rise to €5.4 billion in 2030. These were “significant sums” and come “at an opportunity cost in respect of monies that could otherwise be invested in areas such as housing and infrastructure, which we cannot afford to neglect”, he said. The Donegal TD said the State is projected to run an Exchequer deficit in 2026 and 2027. “Under this legislation, the State would, while running a deficit, transfer €4.3 billion into the fund in 2026 and €4.5 billion in 2027. “We have concerns about the implications for other areas, such as tackling the Government’s housing crisis, of enshrining this provision in law.” He said the funds could be invested inside or outside the State “and there’s a risk that money allocated to this fund will be predominantly invested abroad and in search of higher interest yields”.  This brought “a massive opportunity cost to the State, an opportunity to invest in Ireland” in critical infrastructure and in less economically developed regions, in offshore wind capacity”, he said. Mr Doherty said “it would be a missed opportunity should other jurisdictions benefit from the investment under the fund while the State continues to face significant challenges in housing and infrastructure, challenges that are holding back the economy”. The Bill was passed by 77 to 34 votes and will be debated in the Seanad next week.",0,1
2024/5/16,"Thornton Hall ‘super prison’ site set to be used for asylum seeker accommodation Official Ireland turned an effective blind eye to tents on Mount Street, says Simon Harris  The Government is hopeful that asylum seekers can be moved within weeks to a portion of the site earmarked for the long-stalled ‘super prison’ at Thornton Hall in north Co Dublin. With more tents being erected around Dublin by asylum seekers who have not received an offer of accommodation on their arrival, the pressure to find sites is acute. There are 1,780 asylum seekers awaiting an offer of accommodation, according to the latest International Protection Accommodation Service statistics. It is understood that the Government believes a portion of the 160-acre Thornton Hall site can be made available for tented accommodation, sanitary facilities and kitchen and eating areas. It has long been earmarked as a potential site to accommodate asylum seekers.  The Cabinet was last year asked to approve tens of millions of funding for work on accommodation projects on State sites including Thornton Hall. Other sites identified at the time where tents have already been set up include Columb Barracks, Mullingar and the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, Dublin. Taoiseach Simon Harris on Thursday said the Government needs to “very quickly” identify State-owned land where accommodation can be provided for asylum seekers. The number of tents pitched by homeless asylum seekers along the Grand Canal between Baggot Street and Leeson Street in Dublin increased from around 40 on Tuesday to around 90 on Thursday.  Hundreds of metres of barriers were erected last week along stretches of the canal in an attempt to prevent tents being pitched. This followed an operation involving gardaí, the HSE and Waterways Ireland to clear more than 100 tents and move some 160 people, mostly men, to State sites at Crooksling and Dundrum. Mr Harris said he recognised that there “continues to be an issue with tents emerging” but he felt it was “very different” to the situation that recently developed on Mount Street, where an encampment formed due to its proximity to the International Protection Office. “I believe an effective blind eye was turned by official Ireland to the development of what became almost a public health emergency. What we saw on Mount Street was appalling,” he said, adding that “a lot of intensive engagement” was going on to find sides where safe and sanitary tented accommodation could be provided. However, he added that conversations about migration in Ireland “cannot begin and end every time with accommodation”. “That is just one aspect of what needs to be looked at in terms of the sustainable migration system. We must also look at all the other aspects in relation to migration. We must also look at how the welfare system interacts, how we provide accommodation charges,” he added. Tánaiste Micheál Martin said he believed Thronton Hall should be used to accommodate asylum seekers and that he understood work was underway between various departments in relation to its use. He said the Government was “exhausting every possible opportunity that exists” to utilise State land to help provide accommodation “in respect of the unprecedented numbers that have arrived into the country”. Further restrictions on benefits to refugees and people seeking asylum are to be considered in the coming weeks as the Government seeks to reduce the numbers arriving and ease pressure on the asylum system. An estimated 27,000 Ukrainians who are not in work and live in “State-provided serviced accommodation” such as hotels and B&Bs where meals and other services are provided, are likely to be affected. In six weeks’ time they will see benefits reduced from €232 per week to under €38.80 per week.",0,1
2024/5/16,"Mary Banotti ‘worked fiercely for real change for Irish women’, funeral hears Former Fine Gael MEP ‘adored politics and the European stage was her Broadway’, says daughter Former Fine Gael politician Mary Banotti was “a life force” and “worked fiercely” to secure change for Irish women, her daughter Tania told her funeral Mass in Dublin on Thursday. The eldest of six children, Mary “grew up fast” when her father Jim O’Mahony died at a young age, Tania said. At 19, she left “her boring bank clerk job to train as a nurse in London” before heading to New York where she lived in Greenwich Village, acted in an off-Broadway play and joined the civil rights movement. Later, she moved to Kenya to work as a volunteer nurse where “she met my father, Giovanni, an Italian-Eritrean doctor”. The couple moved to Rome but then separated and “in 1970 she began again in an Ireland that didn’t welcome separated working mothers”. Mary Banotti (84), who died at St Vincent’s hospital last Monday, was MEP for Dublin from 1984 to 2004 and a Fine Gael candidate in the 1997 presidential election. Speaking at her funeral in the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, Foxrock, Tania recalled how on her mother’s return to Ireland in 1970, she “worked fiercely for real change for Irish women”. With “first generation feminists like Nuala (Fennell), Gemma (Hussey), Monica (McWilliams) and Catherine (McGuinness)” and many others, she helped establish Women’s Aid and campaigned for the Family Home Protection Act. What has changed in Ireland since was “thanks to my mother and these fierce women,” she said. As an MEP, Mary Banotti “adored politics and the European stage was her Broadway”, Tania said. Her most meaningful work then was as the first EU mediator for parentally abducted children. “I myself was abducted as a baby, leaving my mother distraught. She translated that trauma into action and was completely dedicated to the issue,” she said. Mary’s biggest campaign was the 1997 presidential election, Tania said, “and while she didn’t win, she was delighted to be part of an election where the main candidates were all women”. She liked to entertain. “It was always informal except one dinner for the [unnamed] British ambassador. She ambitiously roasted goose, which swam in so much fat that it slid off the kitchen counter and under the dining table. When he left his post the ambassador wrote, saying it was the best party of his life here.” Over recent months, Tania said, she and her mother “talked a lot about what’s happening in Gaza”. As an MEP, Mary Banotti had been “an outspoken advocate for Palestine”. Tania recalled how her mother “was enormously loving and proud of me, much to the amusement of her friends and mine. Every birthday she would tell me I was her capolavoro, her masterwork”. “One of Mary’s favourite sayings was sursum corda, lift up your hearts. I will try to lift up my broken heart”, and begin “a new and different part of my life, without her but with her spirit,” she said. During Prayers of the Faithful, family friend Olga Harrington prayed “for those caught up in war and famine, particularly for the children who will not get to live out their lives. Mary’s work for children was an inspiration to all of us and we pray that many others will follow her example and work for peace, justice and equality.” Mass celebrant was Fr Pat O’Donoghue assisted by Canon Alison Shine, goddaughter to Mary Banotti. Chief mourners were Tania and Mary Banotti’s siblings Michael O’Mahony, Nora Owen, Catherine O’Mahony and Joan O’Mahony. President Michael D Higgins was represented by his aide-de-comp Col Stephen Howard. Among the attendance was Taoiseach Simon Harris, TDs Richard Bruton and Chris Andrews, Senator Barry Ward, MEP Frances Fitzgerald, journalists Vincent Browne, Stephen Collins, Olivia O’Leary and former director of the Abbey Theatre Christopher Fitzsimons. A cremation service took place afterwards at Mount Jerome in Harold’s Cross, Dublin.",0,1
2024/5/16,"School places: More than €280m spent on buying modular units for schools in 2023, PAC hears Department defends practice as sum for leasing and buying prefabs described by TD as ‘eye-watering’ Almost €282 million was spent on purchasing modular buildings for schools last year, the Dáil’s public spending watchdog has been told. Department of Education secretary general Bernie McNally was questioned about spending on the rental and purchase of prefabs or modular units for schools during an appearance before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). She rejected an accusation that planning for schools had failed. Ms McNally said temporary accommodation was sometimes necessary in response to population growth as well as for other reasons. Some €29 million was spent on renting modular units in 2021, this increased to €41 million in 2022 and came in at €43 million last year. In 2021, Ms McNally said, there were 396 schools with rented prefabs for more than five years and this number had fallen to 219 as of last month. She said the spend on modular units last year was €281.9 million. Ms McNally said it is “encouraged internationally that we use modern methods of construction”. She said “there is value for money, there’s also climate benefits” and that much of the modular accommodation is “permanent”. Fianna Fáil TD Cormac Devlin later called the sum spent on leasing and purchasing prefabs “eye-watering” as he suggested the department could develop permanent buildings. Department of Education official Hubert Loftus said rentals represented 4 per cent of the department’s capital programme “so it’s a small element”. He said the purchasing of modular units is an “important delivery mechanism”, that Government policy is to add capacity to the modern methods of the construction sector and the department’s framework provides “very climate-friendly solutions, including timber frame modular solutions that we’re very proud of”. Earlier, Sinn Féin TD John Brady raised issues around pressure to find secondary school places. He argued that there has been a “very poor forward planning process” and said this has been evident in his Wicklow constituency. Ms McNally said: “I absolutely acknowledge that there are families around the country that have concerns.” However, she said the State is divided up into 314 school planning areas and “typically” there is a problem in about 10 of these every year. “We have nearly one million children and young people in schools and the vast majority of those get a place and there isn’t a problem.” Mr Brady argued that planning has “fundamentally failed” and he read out a letter he received from a boy in sixth class whose friends have received a secondary school place but he has not yet had one confirmed. Ms McNally said she empathised with the boy in question but that the system is “working overall”. “We are working really hard. Ideally we’d like to have every single young person sorted out much earlier in the year,” she said, adding that the department believed this would happen in the next few weeks. Ms McNally said she respectfully disagreed with Mr Brady when he said there is a “cyclical failure by the department” to deal with the issue of school places.",0,1
2024/5/16,"Fianna Fáil in ‘good position’ to retain majority of council seats, says Micheál Martin  Party emerged as largest after 2014 and 2019 local elections but trailing FG and SF in latest poll before June vote Fianna Fáil is in a “good position” to retain the majority of its local authority seats in next month’s local elections, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said, despite the latest opinion poll suggesting his party is trailing Fine Gael and Sinn Féin. Mr Martin was speaking in Dublin as Fianna Fáil launched its local election campaign and manifesto. Fianna Fáil, which is running 365 candidates across the State, is the largest party in local government. It won 279 seats in 2019 and also took the most seats in the 2014 local elections. The latest Irish Times/Ipsos B&A poll has support for Fianna Fáil at 20 per cent, three points behind Fine Gael and Sinn Féin. Asked if Fianna Fáil was about to lose its position as the largest party in local government, Mr Martin replied: “I remember when we achieved that crown in 2014. The commentators in the first hour after the local election and the count were predicting a desperate day for Fianna Fáil”. He added it was “going to be challenging for us because we got 27 per cent on the last occasion” but that the party has defied predictions in the past. “Local election polls and general election polls are different ... there’s a personal dimension to it as well in addition to a party vote, so I think we’re in a good position to retain the majority of seats that we have,” he said. Asked if he accepted the party would lose seats, he said: “I’m not accepting anything. I’m going out there in a robust fashion. I think we’ll do the very best we can to retain the seats we have and gain extra seats.” The Tánaiste said Fianna Fáil’s “priority” remains housing and the manifesto pledges to “protect and extend” the Help-to-Buy scheme and other initiatives such as refurbishment grants for vacant and derelict homes. It also promises to “strengthen the powers of the local authority to evict tenants for extreme anti-social behaviour and set basic standards for the upkeep of properties”. The manifesto also includes a commitment “to not oppose social and affordable housing projects”. Mr Martin accused political rivals of opposing housing projects, such as those at O’Devaney Gardens in Dublin 7 and Oscar Traynor Road in Coolock, for “ideological reasons”. Put to him that people from all parties, including his own, have opposed housing projects, Mr Martin said: “Given the housing crisis we’re currently in we are committing to people not opposing housing projects. Now people may want to amend certain designs and so on like that, that’s legitimate, but not the actual project itself.” Fianna Fáil’s manifesto also promises to “build safer communities” including introducing a dedicated police force for public transport and boosting funding for crime prevention officers to support neighbourhood watch groups. It says the party would fund a “brighter streets” campaign to improve public lighting in each local authority and set up a coastal erosion fund in areas affected by the problem. Fianna Fáil also wants to reinstate the previously abolished town councils for places with a population of 7,500 or more and to make the annual Culture Night a quarterly event.",0,1
2024/5/17,"Taoiseach outlines Ireland’s intention to recognise Palestine in call with Israeli president Pair spoke by phone on Friday ahead of Ireland’s expected recognition of Palestine next week Taoiseach Simon Harris has outlined Ireland’s intention to recognise the state of Palestine in a call with the President of Israel Yitzhak Herzog. The pair spoke by phone on Friday and the contact comes as Ireland and some other European countries including Spain are preparing to recognise the Palestinian state. Senior Government figures have said Ireland’s recognition of Palestine will happen by the end of May. A Government statement said that Mr Harris “set out the Government’s position on Gaza clearly, especially Ireland’s wish to see an immediate ceasefire and urgent and unhindered access for humanitarian aid. “He expressed deep concern about the potential for catastrophe in Rafah.” There have been fears for weeks for the safety of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Rafah if Israel invades the city as part of its bid to destroy Hamas. Israel faces pressure from the United States, Europe and the United Nations not to send its troops into the city. The Government statement said that Mr Harris “expressed the view that peace and security for Israel and Palestine can only be built on a two-state solution. “He also outlined Ireland’s intention to recognise the State of Palestine.” The statement added: “The Taoiseach made clear Ireland’s abhorrence of Hamas and Ireland’s support for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages.” The two leaders are said to have “agreed to stay in touch”. Israel’s ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich has previously criticised Ireland’s plan to recognise Palestine. She argued last month: “A unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state at this point sends a dangerous signal to Hamas and its supporters, since it will be viewed as rewarding terrorism.” Ireland, and countries including Spain, have indicated that they will recognise Palestine as part of efforts to bring peace to the Middle East. Last week Mr Harris said: “There is never a wrong time to do the right thing and the right thing to do right now is to recognise the state of Palestine. “Why do we do that? We do that because we must keep the hope and the destination of a two-state solution firmly to the forefront. You cannot say you believe in a two-state solution and not recognise that there are two states.” Mr Harris said Ireland recognises the state of Israel and its right to security and peace and “Ireland wishes to recognise the state of Palestine and wishes to see those two states live side-by-side”. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin this week confirmed recognition would happen within the next two weeks. He told the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs: “we need to move on the formal recognition of the Palestinian state. After intensive discussions with European and Arab partners we will do so before the end of this month.”",0,1
2024/5/18,"Analysis: What effect will the Government’s scattergun approach to managing migrants have? A chaotic system involving the Department of Justice, the Department of Integration and the HSE is struggling to cope with increased demand A few weeks ago, a man presented at the International Protection Office (IPO) on Mount Street in Dublin to file his asylum claim and said he had a fever. His temperature was taken by an on-site nurse and, following a brief assessment, he was sent to an emergency department where he was examined for symptoms of malaria. On the face of it, the process was well-organised. In reality, the set-up is chaotic. The man checked himself out of the hospital before doctors confirmed he did not have malaria and was not carrying an infectious disease. No follow-up arrangements had been made with the man, and he disappeared. With three separate bodies – the Department of Justice, the Department of Integration and the HSE – all collecting names and numbers, and an overworked team of health professionals tasked with assessing hundreds of individuals, the system failed. The lack of dedicated clinical space at the IPO, where this man should have been effectively assessed and registered, is just one example of Ireland’s rapidly deteriorating immigration system. In spite of the Taoiseach’s recent assurances of a “multi-agency response” and “Team Ireland” making real progress, the reality for those at the coalface is starkly different. “We don’t have a clinical set-up at the IPO to deal with this,” said one health professional, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We should have routine, robust health at the point of entry but there’s no follow-up plan.” HSE staff appointed to the IPO have not been given additional funding or resources to fully assess new arrivals and have witnessed vulnerable men being sent back out on the streets, the health professional said. Between 60 and 80 people are now triaged for health screening each day, compared with 15 individuals per day last December. This health professional believes the decision not to classify migrants as homeless is a strategy. “It’s the idea that they don’t have the same rights and entitlements as our own homeless. What’s happening now to the people in tents could have happened during the Ukrainian crisis but it didn’t,” said the source. “This is a political choice. We opened every community centre and pulled out all the stops for the Ukrainians. But not for these men.” The Department of Integration says “every effort is being made to source additional accommodation” in the context of an “extremely challenging” environment and local opposition to new centres opening. Yet a veteran working in the field of migration policy and support, preferring to speak anonymously, says the presence of tents around the city centre sends a “very convenient PR message to the general public” that the Government is not helping these men. It “reinforces the idea that men are the problem” and feeds into stereotypes that have been gaining ground across Europe for over a decade, the expert adds. The hardening rhetoric used by some politicians, including the Taoiseach’s commitment that tents would not be “allowed to fester”, is a calculated policy decision, the migration expert argues. This language “sets the parameters for the wider discourse in society” and colours how Irish people understand this country, says Veronica Crosbie, chairwoman of Places of Sanctuary Ireland, a group that supports asylum seekers, and former chairwoman of the Dublin City University MA in Refugee Integration. The word “fester” should be “embedded in our own DNA when we think back to this country’s history of slums”. Ireland’s support for Palestinians in Gaza stems from this memory of our own suffering, she says. However, “you would have thought we’d be more compassionate for people who are suffering here, in Ireland”. Leaving male asylum seekers to pitch a tent on the side of the road “is symbolic of people being on the margins, of shanty towns”, she says. Ireland’s two-tier support system for those fleeing conflict or persecution, created in the wake of the war in Ukraine, further “vilifies” these men. “It was the current Government who set up that ranking system,” says Dr Crosbie. “That creates the effect that some people are more deserving than others. Now they’re proposing to give Ukrainian refugees less, but they created this mess in the first place.” Taoiseach Simon Harris took a more measured approach in his descriptions this week when he spoke of “vulnerable people” in tents and his resolve to ensure a “multiagency response” would continue with “no buck passing” or “siloed mentality”. A spokesperson for the Taoiseach underlined that “453 human beings” had been “taken off the streets to safe shelter” since Mr Harris entered office and that the Fine Gael leader’s “overall message” is that Ireland’s asylum system should be “compassionate and commonsense”. But, with about 50 tents pitched along the Grand Canal on Friday morning, and 1,780 men awaiting an offer of accommodation, the Government will now face the legal implications of leaving men out on the streets. In just under a fortnight, the High Court will hear the case brought by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) that the State is failing to meet international protection applicants’ basic needs. For the first time, the IHREC has brought this potentially landmark case in its own name because of the “gravity of the situation” and the “destitution” faced by those sleeping rough. The High Court will assess whether the State has failed to fulfil its legal obligation to provide shelter, food and access to basic hygiene facilities and whether, as a result, it is breaching the human rights of these people. The Taoiseach’s announcement that all refugee and asylum seeker supports will be reviewed indicates the Government is firmly considering a new direction for asylum policy. It would appear there are votes to be won with a change of direction; this week’s Irish Times/Ipsos B&A opinion poll revealed almost two thirds of voters now favour a more closed immigration policy. The challenge facing the Government on immigration policy as it deals with the current increase in the number of asylum seekers and migrants has parallels with the period before the establishment of the direct provision system 24 years ago. While already operating as a pilot scheme, the decision to formally implement direct provision as a national scheme in April 2000 was hastily carried out in response to a range of pressures, including UK legislative changes and warnings from European bodies that Ireland’s welfare provision was “serving as a magnet”. Two decades on and the Government is again rapidly implementing changes, in large part because of controversial immigration polices unfolding across the Irish Sea. “Direct provision was introduced in a policy panic, a sense that we’ve got to do something fast,” says the migration expert. Two decades on, the State risks repeating history by hastily implementing changes rather than creating “well-designed policies for minorities”. “My worry here is this is a short-term effort at getting votes, setting a direction that we won’t be able to come back from,” says the source. Two decades of work by civil society groups to improve conditions for asylum seekers have also been shelved in a matter of weeks, says Dr Crosbie. “We were heading the right direction, back to a system where people would be given social supports and reclaim that sense of dignity and agency that is so vital for human beings. “But now I look at the tents and I hear this narrative of law and order. The Government has gone into free-fall management; it’s a total shambles.” In reply to queries from The Irish Times, the Department of Justice said that in response to the increase in the number of international protection applicants and space constraints at the IPO, it opened a second processing site - for families with children - at Citywest in early April. The HSE said there was a “coordinated response at the IPO” and that people identified as having specific medical needs by International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) through their vulnerability assessment are referred to a migrant health team.",0,1
2024/5/18,"Miriam Lord: AI Paschal vs TikTok Ava offers a portal into modern manners Minister made deepfake photos of himself to highlight issue of identity theft, but got caught in a transatlantic spat over rude behaviour at the Portal That’s Paschal’s posters sorted for the next election. (He swears he is going to stand again in Dublin Central.) And well done to the people at this week’s European Anti-Financial Crime Summit for coming up with a publicity wheeze guaranteed to pull in more than a few column inches for their conference in the RDS. Among the issues discussed was the growing problem of identity fraud and how to combat it. The Minister for Public Expenditure, wearing his president of the Eurogroup hat, officially opened the event on Thursday morning. Paschal Donohoe agreed to be the guinea pig for some artificially generated “action” photos to show delegates the level of sophistication that professional fraudsters have reached. Colum Lyons, founder and chief executive of ID-Pal, a company that helps businesses verify customer identity, presented images of Paschal skydiving, scuba-diving, kayaking and bursting with brawny intent from a rugby tackle. There were also shots of Alpine Paschal hiking and Gangster Paschal swaggering. The mild-mannered Minister posted a selection on social media to warn people about “the dangers of identity fraud, which is a very serious issue, as these FRAUDULENT images show” and not because he was absolutely thrilled with the results. At the start of the conference, where speakers included Derville Rowland, deputy governor at the Central Bank of Ireland, and Justin Kelly, Assistant Garda Commissioner for organised and serious crime, delegates were shown a welcome video featuring the Eurogroup president, deepfake dimples and all. AI Paschal addressed the audience, saying it was wonderful to see so many people in attendance as the subject was of huge importance to the business and financial sector. He then announced he was speaking to them from South Korea and delivered the rest of his speech in Korean. One observer described it as “gas but terrifying”. But at least it made a change from the usual double Dutch. When he arrived at the RDS, the Minister was still smarting after being told off by a New York-based TikTok influencer and OnlyFans model for saying that people who behaved inappropriately at the live webcam portal between Dublin and New York “let us all down”. Ava Louise was one of those art lovers who forced the temporary shutdown of the installations in Manhattan and opposite the Spire on O’Connell Street. Or as the Irish Sun put it: “Pent-up portal boob flasher has fired a bazooka at Paschal Donohoe after he blasted live-stream conduct.” In an exclusive interview, the “busty American beauty” mounted a passionate defence of her antics and called for the portal to be turned back on to allow people have some fun. “He really should enjoy himself, chill out ... I’ll go back to show him fun. I’ll show him my Big Apples.” We hear apples have been mysteriously appearing on the Minister’s desk over the last couple of days. That explains it. Hannah Hamilton, special adviser to Minister of State for Nature, Heritage and Electoral Reform Malcolm Noonan, has more than just one Minister to look after these days. When she isn’t in Leinster House, Hannah is at home in Kilkenny keeping a close eye on her growing brood of owlets. Malcolm’s right-hand woman has had a long-time interest in “a small nature conservation project” on the banks of the river Nore. Ten years ago she put up a nest box and a pair of barn owls – Late Late Show owls – took up residence and have been having lot of babies ever since. This is a marvellous because they are a critically endangered bird. Last year Hannah upgraded their home and it came with an inbuilt camera. “For the first time I was able to watch them laying eggs and then see the babies hatching and growing. It’s been amazing. I have it on my phone and now I can check in on their progress from Leinster House,” she tells us. Thing is, the collective name for a group of owls is “a parliament”, which is very appropriate under the circumstances. As a result, the Dáil ushers – one of them, Paul Smith, is a keen birder – have now become very invested in the new arrivals and are trying to come up with names for them. There are five babies now, with three eggs still to hatch. Owls lay eggs at intervals so owlets arrive in dribs and drabs. Daddy owl since the beginning is George Clinton – named after the American funkster behind the 1970s music collective Parliament-Funkadelic. Mammy was always thought to be Francey but when the camera was installed Hannah realised Francey was gone and George had moved in a new bird. She was surprised because, as a general rule, barn owls are supposed to be monogamous. But it seems gorgeous George has a roving eye in his rotating head. Jolene was the new squeeze. “They came in this spring for the breeding season and I was looking at the female and I suddenly thought: she doesn’t have a tag. Jolene has a tag. And then we realised it’s another woman and I’m like: George, what are you up to?” The new one is Alice. Hannah posts content from within the owl box on her Too-witter account (sorry). It’s under the hashtag LoveOwland. “Because there’s a lot of drama.” At the moment the owlets “look like little aliens” because they have no fur or feathers. In a week or two they get fluffy and cute and after about a month they get curious and start looking out of the hole, eventually venturing out on to the veranda to practice their flapping before learning to fly. Then philandering George and his latest floozy teach them how to hunt and off they go. Good to see everything is rosy again in Louth Fine Gael after the heir apparent in the constituency put the sitting TD’s nose out of joint by not including him in Tuesday’s PR photo round-up of their local election candidates handing in their nomination papers in Dundalk. A beaming Senator John McGahon was pictured with each of the council hopefuls as they signed their papers. Also in the frame was former senator Jim D’Arcy, who is also from Dundalk. Local man John quickly put the 10 pictures up on his Facebook page. “Busy morning in Louth County Council where all of our Fine Gael candidates for the upcoming election were officially nominated for the June 7th local elections,” he declared, namechecking all the candidates in the Wee County’s five electoral areas. But Senator McGahon’s happy burblings were burst by this terse and rather forlorn response from deputy Fergus O’Dowd, the party’s long-serving TD for Louth, who is based in Drogheda. “Sorry I was not present, I would have been happy to attend, I am saddened by this exclusion.” Poor Fergus. That wasn’t a very nice thing to do. Ejiro O’Hare-Stratton, who is standing in the Drogheda Urban area, rushed to comfort him, nurse’s training to the fore. “I understand how you feel. It’s disappointing to think you could have joined if you had known about the event, especially given the fact that you are the sitting TD for Louth/East Meath constituency. It’s only fair that you should have been invited too.” Not a word from John. Of course, Fergus is retiring from national politics and will not be running in the next general election. So maybe John forgot about him. But then, Jim D’Arcy hasn’t been in the Seanad since 2016, although taoiseach Leo Varadkar appointed him as his adviser on Northern Ireland and border issues in 2017. And they are from the north of the constituency, whereas Fergus is based at the other end, in Drogheda. But John might need Fergus when the time comes for him to hand in his nomination papers and go looking for votes. By Thursday the smiling Senator remembered to include him in the photos after a “busy morning in Drogheda alongside Fergus O’Dowd TD and two of our fantastic candidates in Drogheda Urban”. Hopefully Senator McGahon’was able to find his way back to Dundalk without getting lost. As election slogans go, the one from Aontú’s candidate in Ireland South is a cracker. He is photographed against a background of warships on the high seas. Vote for Patrick Murphy, says the poster. “The man who negotiated the Russian withdrawal from Irish waters.” That’s some boast. Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín is delighted with his catch. Fisherman and mussel grower Patrick met ambassador Yuri Filatov when the Russian fleet planned dangerous naval exercises off the Cork coast in 2022 and persuaded Moscow to withdraw the fleet from Irish waters. The Ballydehob father of four was part of a group of fishermen who told the Russians that they would carry on fishing in the midst of their naval activities. “As a gesture of goodwill” Moscow announced the exercises would be moved after appeals from the fishing community and the Irish Government. When the fishing industry representative was selected to run last year, Peadar Tióbín rather grandly declared: “Patrick came to international prominence as part of a group of fishermen who dared to challenge the flotilla of Russian warships testing missiles off the southwest coast of Ireland. Similarly Aontú is a small new movement taking on the political establishment.” Of course, then minister for foreign affairs Simon Coveney would say his department and officials played a pivotal role in turning back the battleships while rear admiral Senator Gerard Craughwell would also claim credit for threatening to launch a small armada from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Defence to put the frighteners on Putin. After 30 unbroken years in national and local politics, former government minister and recent cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council Mary Hanafin left the political stage this week after completing her final term on the council. She was appointed government chief whip in 2002 and minister for education in 2004 by Bertie Ahern and went on to hold a number of senior portfolios in Brian Cowen’s administration. She lost her seat in Dún Laoghaire, one of the casualties of Fianna Fáil’s 2011 electoral meltdown. Having spent most of her political career on her feet and talking, the former deputy leader of Fianna Fáil is not retiring just yet. She qualified for the bar earlier this year and will be taking her skills to the Four Courts for a new phase in her working life.",0,1
2024/5/19,"Micheál Martin to push for progress on Pte Seán Rooney murder investigation in meeting with Lebanese ministers Tánaiste also set to travel to southern Lebanon to greet Defence Forces troops serving with Unifil mission Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin is set to press the Lebanese government to make progress on bringing to justice the killers of Pte Seán Rooney during his weekend trip to Lebanon. Mr Martin will on Sunday hold talks in Beirut with Lebanese minister for defence Maurice Sleem and minister for foreign affairs Abdallah BouHabib. As part of the weekend trip to Lebanon, Mr Martin, who is also Minister for Defence, will meet with members of the Defence Forces serving on the United Nations Interim Force Lebanon (Unifil) peacekeeping force in the south of the country. The Irish personnel have faced a heightened security environment since last October when the war between Hamas and Israel broke out. The conflict in Gaza, some 200km away to the south, has seen Israel and Iran-backed Hizbullah, an ally of Hamas, trading fire daily along the Lebanese-Israeli border. “A central focus of my visit will be meeting with Lebanese ministers to communicate the absolute determination of the Irish Government to ensure those responsible for Pte Rooney’s death are brought to justice,” Mr Martin said ahead of his meetings on Sunday. Pte Seán Rooney (24), from Newtowncunningham, Co Donegal, was killed in an attack on a convoy of Irish peacekeepers in the Lebanese town of Al-Aqbiya in December 2022. Muhammad Ayyad, the only one of five suspects arrested in the wake of the attack, was charged with a number of offences. His trial was delayed last December when his legal representatives said he was too ill to attend and the proceedings were rescheduled until next month. Mr Martin has been accompanied to Lebanon by secretary general of the Department of Defence Jacqui McCrum, and the chief of staff of the Defence Forces, Lt Gen Seán Clancy. The Tánaiste will travel to Camp Shamrock to meet the members of the 124th Infantry Battalion in Unifil. The Defence Forces personnel there represent Ireland’s largest overseas deployment. The Government recently approved deployment of an additional platoon of 33 Irish troops, including members of the Army Ranger Wing, to serve with the Irish battalion in Lebanon. “I am very much looking forward to meeting our peacekeepers who serve with such distinction in Unifil, and in a very challenging environment amid escalating tensions due to the war in Gaza,” Mr Martin said. “We recently reaffirmed our continuing support to Unifil and the important role it plays in de-escalation in the south of Lebanon, through an increased force protection element to the battalion. “The dedication of Defence Force personnel and their families is a vital part of Ireland’s commitment to global peace and security. Nowhere is this engagement more evident than in south Lebanon.” Unifil was established by the Security Council in 1978 after Israel invaded Lebanon. Its scope and size were expanded after a 2006 war between Israel and Hizbullah that killed 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and 158 Israelis, mostly soldiers. The force is deployed in southern Lebanon with the primary role of helping maintain international peace and security.",0,1
2024/5/19,"Revenue raises concerns over rule change allowing people to sink up to €2m tax free into pension pots ‘Massive loophole’ emerged after the removal of a benefit-in-kind charge on employer pension contributions The Revenue Commissioners has written to the Department of Finance raising concerns over what the Opposition has dubbed a “massive loophole” allowing people to sink up to €2 million tax free into their pension pots. The taxation change, which was introduced in the Finance Act 2022 by then minister for finance Paschal Donohoe, removed a benefit-in-kind charge on employer contributions to a pension pot that had previously been in place. When asked about how the rule change was working out at the Oireachtas finance committee last week, Revenue Commissioner chairman Niall Cody told Sinn Féin’s finance spokesman, Pearse Doherty: “I would be concerned. I am concerned.” He said that this “concern has been shared” with the Department of Finance. Mr Doherty told the committee that tax planners had been actively advertising the measure, later describing it as a “massive loophole in our tax system” that is “being exploited by the wealthiest in our society while ordinary workers struggle to save for their pension”. Mr Doherty said that under the measure, company directors can put more than €2 million into a pension in a single year without paying any tax on it, which could also be used to reduce a firm’s corporation tax bill in the process. Prior to the end of 2022, if combined contributions by an employer to a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) exceeded a certain level – between 15 per cent and 40 per cent of net relevant earnings, dependent on age – the amount above that threshold was treated as a taxable benefit in kind. The employer was entitled to a deduction for tax purposes. The Finance Act 2022 removed this charge following a recommendation from the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group. A spokeswoman for the Revenue said the recommendations were “made with a view to improving and simplifying the pension landscape in Ireland” and would result in increased PRSA contributions. The Revenue Commissioners said since the changes were implemented, it has been “actively monitoring” trends and data in relation to the matter. “This analysis has highlighted a number of cases which need further review and we are carrying out more analysis on same,” the spokeswoman said. “Revenue has discussed this matter with the Department of Finance, during which a high level overview of the analysis carried out by Revenue to date was shared with the department.” A spokeswoman for the Department of Finance said it will “always listen closely to any concerns raised by Revenue and work closely with them to address any issues that are identified to ensure tax provisions are used appropriately”. She added: “As with all areas of tax policy, the Department of Finance is monitoring the implementation of these changes closely and will assess any evidence of misuse.” Mr Doherty said that the existence of the measure “undermines all the principles of pension policy and tax equity and is facilitating aggressive tax planning”, adding he raised the issue with Mr Donohoe at the time “and he either did not understand his own legislation or chose to hide the truth of its consequences”. Mr Doherty said records released to him under the Freedom of Information Act showed the Society of Chartered Actuaries wrote to the department before the change was introduced raising concerns but that recommendations it made were not incorporated to the Act. The Donegal TD said he has raised the issue with Minister for Finance Michael McGrath who he accused of having “repeatedly ignored my concerns”.",0,1
2024/5/19,"‘Common sense’ needed on number of asylum seekers entering Ireland, says Harris Policy must combine compassion and ‘rules-based approach’, says Taoiseach, as current situation ‘not sustainable’ Ireland will remain compassionate while injecting “a degree of common sense” when it comes to the number of people who are entering this country seeking international protection, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. “Irish people are extraordinarily compassionate. As I travel around the country, I’m absolutely aware of the innate decency of Irish people and I think part of it is that there isn’t a family or a community that doesn’t know what it’s like to have experienced immigration over the years and over the generations,” he said. “So it’s really important in this debate around migration, and these policy discussions around migration, that we never lose sight of basic humanity – that behind every number is a human being, in every tent is a person – a vulnerable person in many cases. “But we do have to apply the rules as well and the reason we apply the rules is not because we wish to be nasty, is not because we wish to learn from other countries whom I wouldn’t frankly wish to learn from, who have adopted what I think to be more nasty policies towards migration.” The Taoiseach was speaking in Edgeworthstown, Co Longford, following the National Famine Commemoration, where he drew lines between the suffering of the Irish people during the Great Famine, and the current situation in Gaza. The tragedy of the Great Famine was national, he said, but “the lessons are global” and compel us to “honour the memory of the dead by doing everything we can to prevent similar tragedies elsewhere”. “We must apply the lessons of the Great Irish Famine to our world today, working to alleviate hunger and suffering wherever it exists, honouring human rights, international law, and calling out any and all breaches of it.” He said there was a need for a “rules-based approach” in the migration system because the situation “is not sustainable”. “We can’t constantly have this emergency response,” Mr Harris said. Meanwhile, the issue of direct provision accommodation is also “an extraordinarily challenging situation”, he said, and the conversation “cannot begin and end with one in relation to accommodation”. “We have legal obligations in relation to providing people with shelter. We take those legal obligations extremely seriously. We will see more capacity come on stream in the days ahead in relation to that, and that’s important,” the Taoiseach stressed. But, he added, it is also important to look at all options at our disposal to move on from an emergency response to migration, which he says is “understandable but not sustainable”, to a situation that is more efficient. “What we agreed at Cabinet last Tuesday was that, over the course of the next six weeks, a number of Ministers would review a range of supports in relation to people who were accessing international protection, and would look at how we operate compared to other European countries – are the areas in which we must do better or are there areas in which we’re out of line? “There are around five or six thousand people who are in direct provision accommodation, who do have status. They’ve every right to be in this country. They’ve been assessed as having a right to remain here, they also have every right to work in this country, and many of them probably are, and many of them are probably contributing very importantly to our society. “But there is a legitimate question as to how long you can remain in direct provision accommodation and there is also a legitimate question in relation to how you need to help pay your way in relation to that too. And that will be looked at as part of the review.”",0,1
2024/5/19,"No wish to cut diplomatic ties with Israel as Ireland proceeds with plan to recognise Palestine, says Harris Taoiseach addresses reports of diplomatic row after his phone call with Israeli president Yitzhak Herzog Taoiseach Simon Harris has said Ireland will recognise a Palestinian state by the end of the month while insisting he does not want diplomatic relations with Israel to be severed as a result. Mr Harris was speaking after a report that a diplomatic row has arisen surrounding a phone call between Mr Harris and Israeli president Yitzhak Herzog in which Ireland’s intention to recognise Palestine was discussed. Ireland and some other European countries including Spain are preparing to recognise the Palestinian state and Mr Harris outlined Ireland’s plan to do so during a phone call with Mr Herzog on Friday. According to a RTÉ report, sources close to the Israeli president said Mr Herzog warned that unilateral recognition of Palestine could jeopardise any hope of Hamas releasing the hostages it continues to hold in Gaza and encourage further attacks on Israel. An Irish Government statement in response said: “Some of the content of the anonymous briefing to RTÉ does not accurately reflect the content of the conversation.” Later, speaking to the media in Edgeworthstown, Co Longford, on Sunday morning at the National Famine Commemoration, Mr Harris said he has “less than zero interest in getting into some form of back-and-forth between myself and the president of Israel. “I had a good conversation with the president of Israel. We had a firm and respectful conversation. “It is my job as the Taoiseach of this country to speak up for the Irish position, to speak out on behalf of the people of Ireland,” he said. “The Irish position in relation to the Middle East, in relation to Gaza, in relation to Israel, is very straightforward and very consistent. “We need to see an immediate cessation of violence. We need to see unimpeded and unhindered access to humanitarian aid because there is a humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in front of our eyes, and we need to see a two-state solution. “In order to see a two-state solution and to help bring one about you have to recognise the very existence of two states. And in the coming days, Ireland intends to do just that,” Mr Harris said. Asked whether Ireland would press ahead with unilateral recognition of Palestine if it led to a severing of diplomatic ties with Israel, Mr Harris replied: “Firstly it’s not unilateral: Ireland is working with a number of like-minded countries in relation to this. I expect a number to move in the coming days. I expect more to move in the coming weeks.” “Certainly Ireland doesn’t wish to sever diplomatic relations,” the Taoiseach added. When asked to give details of when recognition of Palestine will occur, the Mr Harris said there is “important sequencing” and political processes that have to be followed so a specific date will be decided in the coming days. “But what I can tell you is it’s absolutely our intention to recognise the state of Palestine this month and there’s not that long left in this month.” On Sunday afternoon a statement from Israel’s embassy in Dublin said: “In their conversation [on Friday], President Herzog reiterated Israel’s concerns regarding a unilateral recognition, which would create more questions than answers: What would Ireland be recognising, since Gaza is under Hamas rule? How does it help the Palestinians in Gaza? The statement also said: “What signal does it send to Hamas, following the brutal attacks on October 7th and thereafter? “In addition, such a step is feared to jeopardise any hope of Hamas releasing the 129 kidnapped individuals they are still holding.”",0,1
2024/5/19,"Withdrawing Irish troops from Lebanon due to Israel-Hamas war may cause added ‘carnage’, says  Martin   Minister for Foreign Affairs visits troops in southern Lebanon where Israel and Hamas ally Hizbullah trade fire daily Irish troops will not be withdrawn from the Lebanon-Israel border for fear of “carnage” developing in the region in their absence, Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has said. Though more than 150,000 people had been evacuated from the region since the Israel-Hamas war began last October, an assessment concluded that the Irish troops would not be withdrawn, Mr Martin said. Speaking on a three-day visit to Lebanon, where on Sunday he met Defence Forces personnel serving with United Nations Interim Force Lebanon (Unifil), Mr Martin said the Hamas attack in Israel last October and the bombardment of Gaza by the Israelis since then had made conditions for the Irish troops much more dangerous. “We obviously did an assessment,” he said when the Israel-Hamas war broke out, adding he spoke to Defence Forces Chief of Staff Lieut Gen Seán Clancy and his advisers. “But you just don’t overnight pull out of a peace operation. We saw where that happened in previous conflicts in the past in different parts of the world with horrendous consequences. And … it’s only when peacekeepers pull out that real carnage develops.” The Israel-Hamas war had also resulted in Israel and Iran-backed Hizbullah, an ally of Hamas, trading fire daily along the Lebanese-Israeli border, in the region where the Irish are based, mainly in Camp Shamrock. Mr Martin said this was “very challenging” for Irish troops, who have been forced to take cover in bunkers hundreds of times, including in recent days, and the Government was “very conscious” of the risks involved. “There has been an escalation in this region [but] not to levels that would be akin to a war or anything like that yet,” said Mr Martin, who is also Tánaiste and Minister for Defence. “Nonetheless, it has resulted in up to 70,000 to 80,000 people having to leave this area [in southern Lebanon] and likewise up to 90,000 people on the Israeli side of the border having to be evacuated.” He added an extra platoon, comprising 33 personnel, including from the Army Ranger Wing,  were being deployed in a bid to shore up force protection. Mr Martin added that the bombardment of Gaza by the Israelis needed to stop and aid be permitted to flow into the region. Lieut Gen Clancy, who is accompanying Mr Martin, said the Hamas attack on Israel last October and retaliatory strikes by Israel had brought about death and destruction “beyond our imaginations”. However, while that conflict had ratcheted up tensions in the region where the Irish troops were operating, the Unifil mission “tempo” and security measures had been adjusted accordingly. The 391 Irish troops, and their international Unifil colleagues, were proving a stabilising force in the region, including performing patrols amid the significantly heightened security environment since last October. “We are well equipped and well trained and well able to sustain and be resilient in our resolve here towards maintaining our operations,” said Lieut Gen Clancy. Mr Martin is on Monday due to meet Lebanese ministers to press them for progress on bringing to justice the killers of Private Seán Rooney. The 24-year-old, from Newtowncunningham, Co Donegal, was killed in an attack on a convoy of Irish peacekeepers in the Lebanese town of Al-Aqbiya in December 2022.",0,1
2024/5/2,"‘We’ll see by the end of the night’ if Government approach to migration is a ‘PR boon to Tory party’, says Martin Tánaiste dismisses ‘right-wing Tory press’ claims over sending gardaí to Border, tells Social Democrats TD not to ‘get taken in by the Telegraph’ Tánaiste Micheál Martin has again insisted that there are no checkpoints at the Border as he dismissed claims that the Government’s “shambolic” approach to migration was a PR boon to the Tory party in their local and general election campaign. Mr Martin said “we’ll see by the end of the night whether it’s been a PR boon or not”, in reference to the local elections currently under way in the UK. He also dismissed a front-page story in the Daily Telegraph, which he dubbed the “right-wing Tory press” about British prime minister Rishi Sunak “imploring the Irish Government not to set up checkpoints at the Irish Border” and “urging the Taoiseach to maintain an open border”. The issue was raised by Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon, who said “you couldn’t make this stuff up”. Mr Gannon said the “Government’s panicked, reactive shambolic approach to migration is not just causing chaos and division in Irish society it is a PR boon to the Tory party in their general election campaign”. He referred to reports of a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on Wednesday evening in which the Tánaiste said that communications and engagement in relation to migration had to improve “on all fronts, this far into the chaos”. The Dublin Central TD said that “every couple of months you’ve promised that you will improve communications”. He added that “it’s very hard to communicate a plan for migration that you very clearly don’t have”. Mr Gannon asked “when is this shambolic Government going to get its act together and get a proper plan in place on migration”. “Get it together, Tánaiste”. Mr Martin told him: “You couldn’t make it up really – a left-wing Deputy like yourself invoking the right-wing Tory press to attack the Irish Government. And you’re taking the Telegraph seriously?” Mr Martin said they would see by the end of the night whether there was a PR boon or not. “There’s obviously no one at any border. There are no checkpoints at the Border. “But I remember actually when I met a former British prime minister, in my time as Taoiseach, when there was a blazing headline across the British press that ‘the frigates are going to France’.” Mr Martin told Mr Gannon that “you have to really stand back and just reflect a bit. Don’t get taken in by the Telegraph, Deputy.” A political row broke out between the Irish and British governments when Mr Sunak said the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda to have their claims processed was already acting as a deterrent. Government figures revealed that 80 per cent of asylum seekers in the State are now arriving from Northern Ireland and the UK said it would not accept their return. Taoiseach Simon Harris has also said gardaí will not be sent to police Border areas but 100 were being redeployed to frontline immigration duties.",0,1
2024/5/2,"Estimated €450m expected to have been spent on metro projects  before Metrolink construction Figure includes estimated €300 million on current plan to connect Dublin airport to the city centre and €150m on past initiatives An estimated €450 million is expected to have been spent by the State on metro projects before full-scale construction of the new Metrolink line begins. The sums involved were described as “astronomical stuff” by the chairman of the Dáil’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC), Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley. A PAC report last year found that nearly €150 million was lost on abandoned projects such as the old Metro North and Metro West projects. A PAC meeting on Thursday heard how it is expected that in the region of €300 million will be spent on the design, planning and procurement phase of the current Metrolink project from Swords to Dublin city centre via the airport before construction begins. Transport officials defended the spending while insisting Metrolink is a separate project from Metro North. The overall cost of Metrolink has been estimated at €9.5 billion. It remains in the planning process and if approved it is not expected that construction will be completed until between 2031 and 2034. National Transport Authority (NTA) deputy chief executive Hugh Creegan told the PAC on Thursday that some €158 million had been spent on Metrolink as of the end of December 2023. He confirmed that no significant physical work has taken place but some “enabling works” had occurred and most of the costs are associated with design, investigations and planning. Mr Creegan said the next stage in the project is “intensive” and relates to procurement. He suggested this could cost between €100 million and €200 million. Asked by Mr Stanley if the pre-construction costs could come to €300 million overall Mr Creegan replied: “That’s the kind of order we’re talking about.” Later in the meeting, Mr Stanley suggested that €450 million will have been spent on the metro projects “without ever buying a carriage or 1m of rail line or sending a digger out to the site” adding “this is astronomical stuff”. Senior Department of Transport official Garret Doocey said the cost of getting multibillion euro projects like Metrolink through planning and pre-planning processes is “significant” and the Department and NTA’s job is to “ensure that we’re getting value for money for that expenditure”. He said that Metro North was a “separate project” it was brought through under appropriate guidelines before it was cancelled. Mr Stanley said he understood it was a separate project but added: “The fact of the matter is the aim is still to get the same thing. It’s to get connection between the city centre of Dublin, north of Dublin and the airport.” Mr Creegan said the spending on the new project Metrolink is “enormous” but added: “that is what it costs to bring through a project of this scale through the design process and get it to construction and this is the time where you need to spend money in order to make sure you’ve got all the details right and minimise your problems downstream.” Mr Stanley said it seemed “very expensive” when “so much money has already gone down the tube” arguing that €150 million was “wasted” previously with “not a thing to show for it”. Mr Doocey responded to this saying there had been a railway order secured for Metro North but the then-Government decided not to proceed with that project. Mr Stanley said that as a “policy decision” and was a matter “for a different forum”.",0,1
2024/5/20,"RTÉ's first European elections TV debate to focus on Midlands-North-West tonight Only eight of the 27 candidates will be allowed appear on the programme which begins at 10.35pm Given the second-tier nature of European Parliament elections, and the sheer size of the constituencies, it is not logistically possible for candidates to employ traditional methods of canvassing. For that reason, TV debates are seen to play a larger part in deciding who gets elected and who does not. For example, the former Green Party candidate Saoirse McHugh was an unknown in 2019, but her strong performance in an RTÉ debate focused on the Midlands-North-West (MNW) constituency – where she challenged Independent candidate Peter Casey’s views on immigration – saw her finish a credible fifth. The first of the three European election debates on RTÉ will take place tonight, at the very late hour of 10.35pm on the Upfront programme hosted by Katie Hannon. Focusing on the MNW constituency, the debate will divert from the usual format of the programme; there will be no audience, for example. The European elections present a particular headache for TV debates. All three constituencies have more than 20 candidates, with the MNW having the most at 27. It would not be possible to host a meaningful debate featuring all candidates, so the national broadcaster has reduced the number to eight. The candidates set to feature in tonight’s debate are: Peter Casey (Ind); Barry Cowen (Fianna Fáil); Luke Ming Flanagan (Ind); Saoirse McHugh (Ind); Chris MacManus (Sinn Féin); Pauline O’Reilly (Green Party); Peadar Tóibín (Aontú); and Maria Walsh (Fine Gael). Strict criteria to select candidates have been laid down, with a particular emphasis on past electoral performance. The maximum number of seats is eight. Priority is given to people who are elected TDs, Senators, MEPs, or councillors, or if they achieved more than 5 per cent of the vote in the constituency. If they stand for a party, the party has to have either: one European seat; two seats in Dáil Éireann; five local election seats; or a 5 per cent vote share. On that basis, Saoirse McHugh and Peter Casey have been selected on the basis of their performances in the last European election. There is no place, however, for Ciarán Mulooly from Independent Ireland, even though he could have argued the newly formed party has three sitting TDs. Only one candidate is allowed per party in this first debate, which means that Lisa Chambers and Niall Blaney (FF); Nina Carberry (FG) and Michelle Gildernew (SF) all lose out. RTÉ has said that to allow as much time as possible for candidates to make their points, there will be no opening or closing statements. The next RTÉ debate, on May 30th, will focus on Ireland South. The final debate will feature candidates in the Dublin constituency on June 4th, just three days in advance of polling day.",0,1
2024/5/21,"Ireland expected to formally recognise state of Palestine on Wednesday Two other EU countries to also move toward recognition amid ongoing conflict in Gaza  The Government is expected to formally recognise the state of Palestine on Wednesday morning, sources have indicated. It is understood two other European Union countries, who have not been identified, will also move toward recognition. Taoiseach Simon Harris, Tánaiste Micheál Martin and Minister Eamon Ryan are due to address the media at 8am on Wednesday where the decision is expected to be addressed. On Sunday, Mr Harris said Ireland would recognise a Palestinian state by the end of the month, but insisted he did not wish to see diplomatic relations with Israel severed as a result of the move that would prove highly controversial. He was speaking after a report that a diplomatic row has arisen surrounding a phone call between Mr Harris and Israeli president Yitzhak Herzog in which Ireland’s intention to recognise Palestine was discussed. The move comes amid ongoing conflict in Gaza and shortly after the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) sought arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas’s leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, for war crimes Mr Harris had previously said that “important sequencing” and political processes had to be followed before an official recognition could take place. “In order to see a two-state solution, and to help bring one about, you have to recognise the very existence of two states. And in the coming days, Ireland intends to do just that,” Mr Harris said. Last month, the Taoiseach and Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sánchez held bilateral talks in Dublin, vowing to gather international support for a two-state solution. Mr Sánchez had also met with Norway’s prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre who said his country also stood ready to recognise a Palestinian state. “The question is when and in what context,” he said.",0,1
2024/5/21,"Taoiseach defends attendance of Israeli ambassador at famine commemoration Harris says ‘we maintain diplomatic links with countries even if we abhor their actions’ and reiterates intention to recognise Palestinian state Taoiseach Simon Harris has defended the attendance of Israeli ambassador Dana Erlich at a famine commemoration last weekend, as Opposition TDs sharply criticised her presence at the ceremony. Mr Harris told TDs that “Ireland has decided to maintain diplomatic links with Israel. We maintain diplomatic links with countries even if we abhor their actions.” He also reiterated the Government’s intention “to recognise the state of Palestine this month”, although he did not specify a date. “We obviously hope to do so with some other countries,” he said. A number of TDs expressed shock at Ms Erlich’s attendance at the famine commemoration in Edgeworthstown, Co Longford and People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett renewed his call for her to be expelled. “I find it quite shocking, to be quite honest, that the Israeli ambassador was asked to attend a famine memorial event when the Israeli regime she represents is wilfully inflicting a famine on the people of Gaza,” he said. Labour leader Ivana Bacik said reports indicated the State may recognise Palestine as early as Wednesday. “I welcome that particularly as we see the horrendous death toll rise in Gaza and as we see International Criminal Court arrest warrants brought against Netanyahu and Israeli and Hamas leaders.” She said the Attorney General’s statement in February to the International Court of Justice that countries must prevent trade that maintains Israel’s annexation of Palestine “is at odds with” the apparent advice to the Taoiseach on the Occupied Territories Bill and she called for a debate or questions and answers suggestion to settle “once and for all” if blocking the progression of the Bill is legal or “merely political”. Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon said part of the International Criminal Court’s case is the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of war. The Israeli ambassador’s presence was “an insult not only to the occasion but to the one million Irish people who died and were forcefully exiled from our nation to a point where we still have not recovered our population”. He said it was a “political decision” because the Russian ambassador was not there but the Israelis and all other ambassadors were. Independent TD Thomas Pringle said the Government made a political decision to invite the Israeli ambassador and to have her “commemorating our famine as Israel is busy committing genocide in the occupied territories is pure hypocrisy”. The Taoiseach said however that “we maintain diplomatic links with countries even if we abhor their actions. I abhor the actions of the Netanyahu government regarding what is happening in the Middle East. “I conveyed that very strongly to the president of Israel in a firm but respectful conversation last week. I conveyed it again on behalf of the people of Ireland in the presence of the Israeli ambassador at our famine commemoration this week.”",0,1

That result, and the decisive rejection of the care referendum on the same day, dealt a severe blow to the Government in the fortnight before Leo Varadkar declared he was standing down as taoiseach. Campaigners for No warned before the family vote of “long-term consequences” for tax law. But when the Government was asked whether it had examined the tax implications of the proposed amendment, it stated in unambiguous terms that there would be no tax impact. “In relation to your specific question, the proposed amendment will not affect taxation, succession or family law,” the Government said during the campaign. Now Revenue files – released by the Department of Finance under the Freedom of Information Act – show how the tax authority noted a lack of clarity “on the extent and scope” of how the proposed Constitutional change would “interact” with tax law. “In the absence of a proposed definition for ‘non-marital family’, it is not possible to consider the impact of any proposed approach on tax legislation,” said a summary of Revenue observations. “If it is the case that the proposed Constitutional change would leave the definition of a Family to the courts, there may be some uncertainty for a time while this definition is settled.” “This may require consequential legislative changes to tax law at the outset of any constitutional change or subsequent to same to reflect the broader policy intention.” Revenue submitted the document to the Department of Finance in June, as part of referendum preparations. Separate files show Finance officials then set out the possible need for “consequential legislative changes to tax law” to the Department of Equality, which ran the referendum. Asked about Revenue’s concerns, a spokesman for Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman said a number of departments and agencies “provided input” as the referendum wording was developed. “The Attorney General is the chief legal adviser to the Government, and the Minister’s statements during the campaign reflected the advice received from him,” the spokesman added. Revenue declined to comment on the files. They follow disclosures showing how the text for the care referendum was chosen to “avoid a concrete and mandatory obligation” on the State. The Government had insisted the draft amendment to “strive to support” care would impose an express obligation on the State in the Constitution. Revenue made no public comment during the family referendum campaign, declining even to say whether it had carried out an impact analysis on any potential tax implications. The tax body insisted it was for the new Electoral Commission to handle questions but the commission never answered queries on tax, pensions, family law, succession and the law of intestacy.",0,1
2024/5/21,"Plan to extend Dart services to Drogheda within three years  Dart+ Coastal North will see electrified line connect commuter stations such as Donabate, Balbriggan and Skerries The Coalition is to seek planning permission to extend Dart services further north as far as Drogheda in Co Louth. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan will brief Cabinet on Tuesday on plans to extend the electrified line, and with it Dart services, by another 37km beyond its current terminus at Malahide. If the project achieves planning permission and is built out, it would also extend Dart services under the banner of Dart+ Coastal North to commuter stations such as Donabate, Balbriggan and Skerries. Mr Ryan will tell Cabinet that the project will double passenger capacity between Malahide and Drogheda from about 4,400 people at peak hours to 8,800. Ministers will hear that the plan is to submit the applcation to An Bord Pleanála by July. If approved, the project is expected to be completed within roughly three years. Mr Ryan is promising to boost rail services by 2026 with the roll-out of 65 new battery-electric Dart carriages. The northern extension is part of the wider Dart+ programme, which envisages expanding the existing network from 53km to 150km, extending the line to Maynooth and the M3 Parkway to the east, and to Hazelhatch and Celbridge in the southwest. Mr Ryan is also expected to update Ministers on the Climate Action Plan, which is not expected to feature plans for a dairy farmer exit scheme, which had divided opinions in the farming community. The scheme had been developed by the Department of Agriculture but, following further consultation, it has been dropped from the climate plan. Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue had given a strong indication that it would not proceed last month. The update for Cabinet will contain new information on the annex of actions to the plan. Elsewhere, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien will tell Cabinet colleagues it is too early to predict the final output in housing for the year, but that he believes an uplift seen in recent years will be sustained. The Coalition continues to face affordability and access issues in the rental and home purchase markets, despite increased output in recent years. Mr O’Brien will tell Cabinet that 60 per cent of housing delivered in the last decade was constructed in the period to the end of March this year, and outline that 11,568 homes that were either previously unfinished or had been disconnected from the ESB network for two years or more have been added to the housing stock in the same period. Minister for Finance Michael McGrath will brief Cabinet on the annual report of Home Building Finance Ireland. Late on Monday evening the indications were that the Cabinet would not discuss proposals to recognise Palestinian statehood, which have been promised before the end of the month. Ireland, along with a group of like-minded European countries, is expected to take the step – with some reports last week indicating it could come as soon as tomorrow. However, sources said that there were still hopes more countries could sign up to the decision, with Norway also said to be considering the step. Irish sources said there had been some waning enthusiasm for the move among some EU governments, against the backdrop of European Parliament elections which have made some countries nervous over how the decision could be perceived by their electorates.",0,1
2024/5/22,"Harris says Ireland’s recognition of Palestine is an affirmation of Palestinian right to self-determination Taoiseach rejects suggestions from Israel that Government’s decision will challenge Israeli sovereignty and security The announcement was made in tandem with the governments of Spain and Norway, who similarly declared their intention to recognise an independent Palestinian state. Ireland’s recognition of Palestinian statehood will come into effect next week on May 28th. In announcing the decision the Taoiseach characterised Ireland’s recognition of Palestine as a step towards peace in the Middle East, and an affirmation of Palestinians’ right to self-determination, independent statehood, security and dignity – at times drawing on Ireland’s own struggle for independence. The announcement “is an act of powerful political and symbolic value”, and marks “an important and historic day”, Mr Harris said from the steps of Government Buildings. “It is an expression of our view that Palestine holds and should be able to vindicate the full rights of the state, including self-determination, self-governance, territorial integrity and security, as well as recognising Palestine’s own obligations under international law.” He was joined in making the announcement by Tánaiste Micheál Martin and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, the former labelling the announcement “a historic moment”. Mr Harris’s announcement immediately drew the ire of Israel, who said that the decision undermined the country’s sovereignty and security. Dana Erlich, Israel’s ambassador to Ireland, was recalled from Dublin by foreign minister Yisrael Katz, with similar action taken against Spain and Norway. Drawing on Ireland’s own past, Mr Harris spoke of Ireland’s pleas to the international community for the recognition of its independence and right to self-determination over 100 years ago. “Today we use the same language to support the recognition of Palestine as a state. We do so because we believe in freedom and justice as the fundamental principles of international law, and because we believe that permanent peace can only be secured upon the basis of the free will of a free people.” This recognition is a “message” to Palestinians who advocate for peace and democracy, Mr Harris said, that Ireland fully respects their aspirations “to be living freely in control of your own affairs, under your own leadership”. Mr Harris rejected suggestions from Israel that the Government’s decision would challenge Israeli sovereignty and security. “Israel loses nothing from the recognition of the state of Palestine. We need to see a two-state solution that recognises the state of Israel recognises the state of Palestine.” Asked about the timing of the Government’s decision, and the perception that it was prompted by events following the October 7th attacks on Israel, Mr Harris said “Hamas is not the Palestinian people”. “Here in Ireland, better than most countries in the world, we know what it’s like when a terrorist organisation seeks to hijack your identity and seeks to speak for you.” He said right-thinking people were able to differentiate between “the actions of terrorists” and “the decent people of a state”. Mr Harris accepted that it had long been the position of successive governments to recognise Palestinian statehood. The Dáil unanimously voted to recognise a state of Palestine in 2014. At present 143 member states of the United Nations recognise Palestinian statehood. The three Coalition leaders were at pains to point out that recognition of Palestine was not an endorsement of Hamas – there were repeat condemnations of the October 7th attacks in which 1,200 people were killed by Hamas militants – or a hostile act towards Israel, pre-empting any “misrepresentation” of Wednesday morning’s announcement. Rather the act of recognition was “a statement of unequivocal support” for the two-state solution, “the only credible path” to peace between Israelis and Palestinians, Mr Harris said. Ireland recognised the state of Israel and the state of Palestine equally. Mr Harris admitted that 30 years after the Olso Accords peace in the Middle East was “perhaps further away than ever”. He said keeping alive the aspirations of those peace agreements was “a huge challenge”. The Taoiseach said the Government’s announcement came at a time of “appalling suffering, hardship and starvation” for Gazan Palestinians. “How can anyone justify children going to sleep not knowing if they will wake up?” Mr Martin said the decision was a promotion of “moderation” in Palestine. “It can be argued that Israeli strategy, war and suppression of the Palestinian people has empowered extremism,” he said. Throughout the briefing the three leaders reiterated calls for a ceasefire, a release of hostages, and unhindered access of humanitarian aid into Gaza. “Civilians on all sides must be protected by international humanitarian law. Violence and hatred can only ever be a dead end,” Mr Harris said. Mr Harris also rejected suggestions that the announcement was “virtue signalling” or a populist move ahead of next month’s European elections. Mr Martin said Ireland rejected calls for the entirety of the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the river Jordan to form a “mono-ethnic state, based on either forced exile or subjugation”. He outlined the obligations of Palestinian leaders in a Palestinian state to provide “democracy, to human rights, to good governance, and to the rule of law” to its people. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan drew parallels to Ireland’s experience with violence during the Troubles and the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. “We have learned the hard way that violence against innocent civilians to try and achieve political aims cannot and must never win.”",0,1
2024/5/22,"Full text of Simon Harris speech on ‘historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine’ Taoiseach confident other countries will follow lead of Ireland, Norway and Spain Good morning all, Last month I stood on these same steps with Prime Minister Sánchez of Spain when we agreed that the point of recognising the State of Palestine was coming closer. That point has now arrived. Today, Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we are recognising the State of Palestine. Each of us will now undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision. In the lead up to today’s announcement, I have spoken to a number of other Leaders, and I am confident that further countries will join us in taking this important step in coming weeks. This is an historic and an important day for Ireland and for Palestine. On January 21st, 1919 Ireland asked the world to recognise our right to be an independent State. Our ‘Message to the Free Nations of the World’ was a plea for international recognition of our independence, emphasising our distinct national identity, our historical struggle, and our right to self-determination and justice. Today we use the same language to support the recognition of Palestine as a State. We do so because we ‘believe in freedom and justice as the fundamental principles of international law’, and because we believe that ‘permanent peace’ can only be secured ‘upon the basis of the free will of a free people’. Taking our place on the world stage – and being recognised by others as having the right to be there – was a matter of the highest importance for the founders of our State. From our history, we know what it means. Recognition is an act of powerful political and symbolic value. It is an expression of our view that Palestine holds and should be able to vindicate the full rights of a state – including self-determination, self-governance, territorial integrity and security – as well as recognising Palestine’s own obligations under international law. It is a message to those in Palestine who advocate and work for a future of peace and democracy, that we fully respect your aspirations to be living freely, in control of your own affairs and under your own leadership. On May 10th, 143 out of 193 UN Member States – 80% of those present and voting – voted to determine that the State of Palestine is qualified for membership in the United Nations in accordance with the Charter of the UN. Our step today, taken with Norway and Spain, is further recognition of the legitimate right to statehood. It is a statement of unequivocal support for a two-State solution – the only credible path to peace and security for Israel, for Palestine and for their peoples. We have previously said that recognition is a step that we would ideally have taken as part of a process towards that goal. However, we are three decades after the Oslo process and perhaps further than ever from a just, sustainable and comprehensive peace settlement. Our decision to recognise Palestine should not have to wait indefinitely, especially when it is the right thing to do. It is a decision being taken on its merits. But we cannot ignore the fact that we are taking it as Palestinians in Gaza are enduring the most appalling suffering, hardship and starvation. A humanitarian catastrophe, unimaginable to most of us and unconscionable to all, is unfolding in real time. Can anyone justify children going to sleep at night not knowing if they will wake up? Today we are taking a significant political step. There will be reaction and interpretations of its implications but let us not lose sight of this fundamental truth: Children are innocent. The children of Israel. The children of Palestine. They deserve peace. It is long past time for a ceasefire, for the unconditional release of hostages and for unhindered access for humanitarian aid. There should be no further military incursion into Rafah. There should be no more Hamas or Hizbullah rockets fired at Israel. Civilians, on all sides, must be protected under International Humanitarian Law. Violence and hatred can only ever be a dead end. The only pathway to peace is political. The people of Palestine deserve a future filled with hope, a future defined by success instead of suffering. A future at peace. The people of Israel deserve the exact same thing. To the people of Israel, I say today: Ireland is resolute and unequivocal in fully recognising the State of Israel and Israel’s right to exist securely and in peace with its neighbours. Let me be clear that Ireland condemns the barbaric massacre carried out by Hamas on October 7th last. Civilians attacked and murdered. Hostages taken in the most brutal and terrifying of circumstances, including a young Israeli-Irish child. We call again for all hostages to be immediately returned to the arms of their loved ones. Let me also be clear that Hamas is not the Palestinian people. Today’s decision to recognise Palestine is taken to help create a peaceful future. A two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment, where so many wrongs can never make a right. Just as Ireland’s recognition as a state eventually led to the establishment of our peaceful Republic, we believe that Palestinian statehood will contribute to peace and to reconciliation in the Middle East. A peace that honours the legitimate aspirations of all people in the region to live with respect, justice, security and dignity, free from violence or the threat of violence. Today, moving in lock step with our European colleagues, we seek to be bearers of hope. We want to reaffirm our belief that peace is possible, that justice is achievable, and that the recognition of both States – Palestine and Israel – is the cornerstone upon which that peace must be built. So today, we are saying that we recognise the state of Israel and its right to exist in peace and security within internationally agreed borders. We equally recognise the state of Palestine and its right to exist in peace and security within internationally agreed borders. Recognising the statehood of Palestine sends a message that there is a viable alternative to the nihilism of Hamas. Hamas has nothing to offer but pain and suffering to Israelis and Palestinians alike. There is also no future in the extremist version of Zionism that fuels settler violence and illegal appropriation of land in the West Bank. I would like to thank our international partners, in Norway and Spain and in other like-minded countries, for their close and continued co-operation. I thank the Tánaiste for his continued work on this matter. I look forward to continuing to work with them on our shared objective of delivering long overdue peace and prosperity to the people of Israel and Palestine and the wider Middle East. Ireland will always stand with all those ready to walk a political pathway to peace and we will do everything in our power to help to bring it about. That is what today’s decision is about. We take it to offer hope and encouragement to the people of Palestine in one of their darkest hours. We in Ireland see you, we recognise you, we respect you. We will continue to work so that you and your children and your children’s children can have the better future you deserve and so that one day Palestinian children and Israeli children can live side by side in peace and security.",0,1
2024/5/22,"Why Ireland is recognising the state of Palestine, how it happened and what it means for Irish-Israeli relations Ireland’s move does not recognise a specific government in the area and is based on various UN resolutions Ireland is going to recognise the state of Palestine based on 1967 borders, which means the borders are based on the situation before the Israeli occupation of parts of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The rationale for this stems from a range of United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Recognition is given to states rather than to governments. The Palestinian Authority (PA), the Fatah-led secular government which controls areas of the West Bank, is acknowledged as the governing authority in the state and that will be the case for Ireland’s recognition, even though the PA doesn’t have full authority within its area. In peacetime, Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, while Israel controls East Jerusalem and much of the West Bank. Senior officials, as well as Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin, have been working in the background for some time, with meetings and discussions since December around each Foreign Affairs Council. Mr Martin, who is also Minister for Foreign Affairs, was engaged in shuttle diplomacy for months, going back to a dinner he hosted with like-minded countries to discuss the possibility of recognition on January 21st. That was followed by a round of calls and meetings with the UAE, Jordan, Norway, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt and Spain across March, before more back channelling with Slovenia and Norway in April and May. His Middle East trip in April was also pointed to by allies as important – before a final call with the Palestinian prime minister last night. The Department of Foreign Affairs also flagged the plan with the US, EU countries and Israel as part of a no-surprises strategy. It’s understood that the US administration didn’t send anything back that gave cause to pull up the handbrake, but sources in Dublin admit that it wouldn’t have been Washington’s first course of action. The decision by Ireland, Spain and Norway to formally recognise Palestine takes effect on May 28th. The three countries have different processes to go through and by that date, all governments will have completed their respective steps needed. No. Ireland recognises the PA as the legitimate governing authority across the occupied Palestinian territories and, along with the EU, considers Hamas a terrorist organisation. Hamas has welcomed the step, seen in Dublin as an unfortunate if unsurprising development. Ireland’s position remains that these are illegal settlements under international law, regardless of whether Palestine is recognised as a state. It wasn’t flagged in advance, but there was in fact a formal government decision on Tuesday to recognise the state of Palestine and for coalition leaders to announce that at an appropriate time. There may be another decision next week to mark the recognition date. There has been some talk of a Dáil debate, even if one is not technically needed. Both will be upgraded to embassy status rather than the current diplomatic/representative missions. Feilim McLaughlin, currently head of mission in Ramallah will become Irish Ambassador to Palestine, and Dr Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, currently ambassador/head of mission in Dublin will become Ambassador of the state of Palestine. Norway, Spain and Ireland argue that the step is part of a wider effort to get back on a political path to a two-state solution which recognises Palestinian rights to self-determination and their statehood. Ireland believes there has now been a fundamental change in the dynamic necessitating recognition now, while it had previously been envisaged under the Oslo accords that recognition for Palestine would come towards the end of a wider two state solution peace process and negotiations resulting in settlement and agreement. Ireland, Spain and Norway believe that this will enable progress to be made with both states seen as equally legitimate. Another important context is the Arab Peace Vision being worked on by Jordan, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Palestine have been working on in recent months. It was presented to the US side and will be presented formally for the first time to European countries foreign ministers on Sunday in Brussels. That vision, which Ireland views as the only game in town for getting to the end of the current conflict and towards a two-state solution, and ultimately build pressure for a political solution, asks European countries to recognise Palestine as a core part of pulling together a two state solution. Not a whole lot positive, it must be said. Officials in Dublin are insistent that this recognises the sovereignty and equal aspirations of both countries and is conceived of as a move towards a peaceful two state solution and is not a hostile move against Israel. It is clearly not an explanation that is accepted in Israel, where the Irish ambassador will be summoned for a severe démarche (diplomatic dressing down) by the government in Jerusalem. Reports in Israel suggest that Ireland, Norway and Spain will be diplomatically “isolated” there – not summoned to briefings, not given updates and requests will be delayed. Meanwhile, the Israeli ambassadors here, in Oslo and Madrid have been temporarily recalled – a step Ireland had expected and one which would be seen as at the lower end of potential backlash. Dublin doesn’t expect fallout for Irish citizens in Israel or for the small number of Defence Forces personnel in Israel. Ireland has no plans to recall our ambassador to Israel. A range of scenarios have been sketched out by officials in Iveagh House. In 2014, when Sweden recognised Palestine, there were no political visits for a long period, very limited contact between political leaders, and obstacles were put in Sweden’s way in respect of access to Gaza. However, Ireland believes it is difficult to be precise about what exactly might happen. Moves that could restrict Ireland’s operations and development programmes in Palestine are seen as possible. Contingency planning and work on mitigating actions are under way in Dublin to address what may come next, with a hope that the joint action with Spain and Norway may give Israel a pause for thought on potential sanctions. The Arab Peace Vision mentioned above will be presented to European leaders on Sunday, and on Monday, the Council of Foreign Ministers will meet. However, any movement on an EU level is not expected as the bloc remains split over the issue. Ireland is expected to keep up multilateral and bilateral efforts to convince other like-minded countries to recognise Palestine, with Slovenia seen as a matter of time after its government approved the decision, and Malta also seen as more likely to move. Belgium has also been mentioned in dispatches. Ireland will also remain in contact with the Saudis, the US and Palestinians on the peace vision front in the hope a step-by-step process will emerge. Officials believe that recognising Palestine doesn’t run contrary to the idea that borders may change in land swaps agreed arising from any culmination of the two-state solution process, arguing you can recognise a country without final definition of its borders and that Ireland recognised Israel when it did not have internationally recognised borders.",0,1
2024/5/22,"Palestinian whose family fled Gaza to Ireland says it is ‘a historic moment full of emotions’ Protester at announcement describes recognition of Palestine as ‘giving a reward to a terrorist organisation’ Ireland’s recognition of the state of Palestine is “giving hope” to Palestinians living in Ireland. The move, announced by the Taoiseach on Wednesday, is a “crucial step for building a bright future”. “We’re grateful for Ireland’s strong support and its historical step to recognise Palestine as a state. This is a crucial step for building a bright future without occupation,” said Ahmed Alsammak, a master’s student who came to Dublin in September for his studies. “I deeply wish all western countries emulate Ireland, Norway, and Spain as I don’t want my children to have the same tough childhood that I had due to the Israeli occupation,” he told The Irish Times. Irish people had “unwaveringly supported” Palestinians, Alsammak said. “That really has helped us as Palestinians in Ireland and alleviated our suffering as we see our families in Gaza suffering from famine and mass killings by the Israeli army.” Ireland, Norway and Spain recognised the Palestinian state on Wednesday, prompting Israel to recall its ambassador from Ireland and Norway. Taoiseach Simon Harris told the Dáil the move was not taken “to be virtuous” but because there was a belief in a two-state solution. “The people of Israel and the people of Palestine have a right to live side by side in two states and peace and insecurity. And if you believe in a two-state solution it’s important that you recognise the existence of two states.” The countries who recognise Palestine do so as part of a peace process, he said. “But sadly we’re at a time where a just and comprehensive peace settlement seems further away than ever, perhaps, and you can’t wait forever to recognise the state of Palestine.” Another Palestinian student who grew up in Gaza, Asil Nasir, said the announcement gave Palestinians “more hope that actual negotiations might happen”. “We always see the solidarity of the people of Ireland, but the Government didn’t do anything practical as a reaction to what’s been happening in Gaza, but after this recognition of the state of Palestine there is hope,” she said. The move was “a significant diplomatic victory” for Palestine and could be “a move to encourage other countries to follow suit, potentially leading to increased pressure on Israel to engage in meaningful negotiations”, she said. Isam Hammad, whose family fled Gaza and arrived in Ireland in February, said it was “a historic moment full of emotions”. “To be in Ireland and witness this strategic shift towards recognising the state of Palestine...Our people have been fighting for years to restore our rights on our land,” he said. Hammad and his family fled their home in Gaza City and travelled to Rafah in October, a fortnight after the Hamas-led assault in southern Israel and the subsequent Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip. In November the family applied for Irish visas through his son Hamza, who was born in the Coombe Hospital in Dublin in 1997 and has Irish citizenship. They are now living in homeless accommodation in the city centre. “Recognition is the first ingredient of the recipe of peace, which will never be established without allowing the people of Palestine to have their sovereign state on their own land,” Hammad said. Meanwhile, a small number of protesters gathered at the gates of Leinster House following the announcement. Lior Tibet, a student in UCD, said Israelis had experienced harassment on campus and a one-sided narrative in Ireland and in the Irish media. “We do feel [recognition] is giving a reward to a terrorist organisation,” she said. “It’s not that we are against a two-state solution, we are pro-Palestinians, we want them to have a state, but we are opposed to Hamas, and as long as Hamas is the head of the state at the moment I just can’t see how it’s any benefit to the Palestinians and Israelis.” She said there was a misconception of the concept of Zionism in Ireland, which she said was not against a Palestinian state. Cormac, who declined to give his second name, said there had been multiple proposals for peaceful solutions that had been rejected by the Palestinian Authority. He said recognition of the state of Palestine needed to take place within a framework of peace negotiations. Enosh Hortig, an Israeli studying and living in Ireland, said Israel had been attacked and needed to tackle Hamas. He said the number of civilian deaths that had been reported was not correct. “[Hamas] are using their civilians [as] a human shield to fight against Israel. With terrorism you need to fight, and if they use their children as a human shield you have nothing to do and nothing to say; it’s very sad for us but you need to fight and kill all the bad people and all the terrorism.”",0,1
2024/5/22,"Mayoral candidates clash over role of Land Development Agency in Limerick Ten politicians  contesting June 7th election voice strong differences of opinion on transport solutions for the city and county There were strong differences of opinion between candidates for the new position of executive Mayor of Limerick and a proposed Northern Distributor Road for the city during a two-and-a-half hour hustings on Tuesday. Several candidates at the event, held at the Technical University of the Shannon, argued strongly for the need for the road to ease congestion and to improve access to the suburb of Moyross, the University of Limerick as well as the city’s industrial zone at Plassey. They included Fine Gael councillor, Daniel Butler who said that international companies and the city’s big educational institutions were calling for them. However, other candidates, including Green Party TD Brian Leddin, said the road was unnecessary and that developing Limerick’s rail networks and public transport infrastructure was a better way of reducing congestion. “I have yet to see a case for the Northern Distribution Road that costs €500 to €600 million,” he argued. “It will lead to our city sprawling in a non compact way and car-dependent development.” Labour candidate Conor Sheehan said the road project was “dead “as it was not in the National Development Plan and could not be revived. “We do not live in the International People’s Fiefdom of Limerick,” he said. Fianna Fáil candidate, Dee Ryan, said she supported phase one and two of the road but said the was not in favour of the road being developed on the Care side of the city as it would lead to ancillary development that would take people away from the city centre. In all, 10 of the 15 candidates for the position took part in the event, which was convened by political editor of The Irish Times, Pat Leahy. Elections for the position will take place on June 7th, along with the local and European Elections. The new mayor, who will hold the position for five years, will have executive powers and will control a €700 million annual budget. The may will have responsibility for strategic planning, housing, road transport, road safety and the environment. The debate was divided into two segments, with five candidates in each. Sinn Féin TD Maurice Quinlivan said he would have liked the mayor have wider powers and hoped a new Government would devolve more powers. He said that he wanted to be a ‘minister for limerick’ if elected. Like other candidates, he said that while health did not come within the remit of the mayor, it would be remiss of him as mayor not to highlight the problems associated with University Hospital Limerick. Another of the front runners, independent candidate John Moran, focused in on his ability to get projects delivered. He told the audience that as a former secretary general of the Department of Finance and at senior levels in the private sector, he had delivered. He said he wanted to set out a vision for a more liveable Limerick. There was general agreement among all the candidates that upwards of 2,500 houses were needed for the city, but there were differences of opinion on how that could be achieved. Some backed the Land Development Agency but others criticised delays in project getting off the ground. The Social Democrats candidate, Cllr Elisa O’Donovan castigated the agency for not being transparent and for breaking promises. Independent candidate Helen O’Donnell said she would establish and “accelerator unit” in the local authority to speed up progress on housing, and to end dereliction and vacancy throughout the south. Another independent candidate, Laura Keys, said that the mayor needed to engage with community groups and move away from a top-down approach. Like most other candidates, she said that parts of the city centre had become run down and needed renewing. “We need an end to urban sprawl. We need to do what they do in Madrid. They created a forest ring around the city to allow compact development,” she said. Mr Moran, a former chair of the LDA, said there were acres and acres of land in Limerick which could be used immediately. Modular housing could be supplied on the land straight away “in the thousands”, he suggested. “Modular housing which could be introduced in a matter of year or two could be used to provide as a temporary solution for four or five years to bring down rent in Limerick.” Another independent candidate, Frankie Daly, said his approach to tackling Limerick’s challenges would not be to dictate but to work as apart of a team, to facilitate development. “We are the capital of the midwest and we are not getting the same resources as other places,” he said. Mr Quinlivan did not express support for the LDA continuing with its role in terms of delivering on housing in Limerick. “The Government has run out of ideas as it was 13 years in office and is stale,” he argued. “There’s lot of land that is owned by the LDA. If I’m elected, the first thing I will do is sit down with Government to ask that land to be released to the local authority.” In terms of the city centre, Mr Sheehan said he would set up a taskforce for rough sleeping, similar to what has been done in Manchester. “I would fund part of it from my salary. Crack cocaine is rife in Limerick. There is aggressive begging,” he said. On transport, Mr Leddin said that a railway linking Limerick to Shannon Airport could be delivered within five years at a cost of €200 million. He said it would be a “game changer’ for the region. He also said that the extensive rail network could be developed to allow commuter trains to Adare. Ms Ryan said that every community in Limerick city and county should have access to a good quality playground. Mr Butler said there was a need for 2,500 social houses and the mayor’s role would be to ensure delivery on key sites.",0,1
2024/5/22,"Taoiseach hits back at housing criticism, citing progress - but will voters agree? Coalition will argue it has acted on many recommendations of the Housing Commission report but it needs to show results For more than a year now, the Government has been insisting that Ireland has “turned a corner” on housing and in the Dáil on Tuesday, it was no different. In the face of sustained attack from the Opposition, who characterised leaked extracts from a report by the Government-appointed Housing Commission as an indictment of the Coalition’s housing policy, Taoiseach Simon Harris shot back that the progress being made was undeniable and the report was about what comes next “now that we have a functioning housing market”. The report certainly doesn’t sketch out a functioning housing market. It opens with lines that excoriate accumulated failures to address this policy sore — and the system that allowed it to emerge in the first place. Interventions have “not resolved failures that are fundamentally systemic”, with “ineffective decision making and reactive policy making where risk aversion dominates”; this causes volatile supply, undermines affordability and arises from “the failure to successfully treat housing as a critical social and economic priority”. It calls for a “radical strategic reset of housing policy”, giving a soundbite to the Opposition that sustained them throughout the day. In a line reminiscent of countless verdicts on our healthcare system, its dour verdict is that as a consequence of multiple failures, the State has one of the highest levels of public expenditure on housing in Europe, “yet one of the worst outcomes”. In truth, the extracts from the report are not simply a scorecard for this Government’s housing policy; the scope is broader than that, with the assessment reaching further back in time to the roots of the crisis and throwing solutions forward well beyond the scope of the Coalition’s term. It lays out a daunting vision of the future. It paints a picture where household sizes are shrinking, the population is ageing, and household formation (people setting out by themselves and starting a family) is being suppressed significantly. In short, Irish people are trapped in larger households where ambitions are stunted. The true nature of household demand has been misstated due to the clogged-up market, with an underlying deficit of 256,000 homes, and many people are ageing with an uncertain future in front of them. Dublin, as the engine of economic growth, is under-resourced in infrastructure, pressed by the foreign direct investment-led model to grow and simultaneously constrained by national policy that seeks to spread growth to the regions, resulting in sprawl and suffocating the city with quality-of-life shortcomings. Ireland, bearing the scars of the Celtic Tiger era, has become obsessed with avoiding oversupply, it says, and failed to properly account for the costs of undersupply. It calls for higher targets for housing delivery overall, the creation of a new State agency, the housing delivery oversight executive, and for 20 per cent of the housing stock to be social and affordable. The commission argues that there are “clear solutions” if there is a commitment to address the issues, saying that specific details can be complex but the overall strategy need not be. Easier said than done, no doubt. The Government will doubtlessly argue that it is already acting on many of the recommendations in the report. Indeed, some of its recommendations seem to suggest policies some versions of which it has already advanced. While this offers a handy line of defence for the Coalition, it will also increase pressure on them to show that their measures are working. The challenge for the Coalition is not to list schemes and interventions but to convince people these myriad plans are making a difference in access and affordability. That is a trickier process, and for months now, Ministers have privately acknowledged that the Coalition only stands a chance of success on housing when people begin to feel a change. Right now, for every green shoot it points to, there are still multiple examples of real-life expectations being constrained by a thicket of overlapping crises. For the Opposition — on a day when almost the entire Dáil agenda was being given over to housing issues — the leak was a golden chance to focus voters’ minds. In its way, this is no less pressing for Sinn Féin in particular. The party built its polling success on a laser-guided critique of Government housing policy, but while housing remains top of voters’ concerns, for some reason the party has plateaued and begun to decline. The key part of this entire strategy is to link housing dysfunction not just with the shortcomings of one minister or government, but with an entire style and culture of politics it says it will change — on Tuesday, the party said umpteen times that Fine Gael has been in power for 13 years. If voters cannot be swayed by this argument, the polls suggest that Sinn Féin does not have another angle of attack that will attract voters to its banner in the same way. As Ireland gears up to vote, the Opposition and Government are betting on housing in different ways.",0,1
2024/5/22,"Housing Commission: Details of all rents should be publicly available and pressure zones replaced, report says Leaked document highly critical of Ireland’s housing market, sharpening focus on issue ahead of elections The Government should replace long-established rent pressure zones (RPZ) with a new system of regulation while making all rents being charged publicly available, the Housing Commission has recommended. The leaking of parts of the report has put the Government on the back foot over housing in advance of a vital election period, with charges that the housing crisis in Ireland has been driven by “ineffective decision making and reactive policy making”. The report’s verdict that the housing crisis in Ireland has been driven by “ineffective decision making and reactive policy-making” led to strident criticism of Government policy from the Opposition. It finds that although Ireland spends among the most in Europe on housing, it has some of the worst outcomes. A full copy of the report obtained by The Irish Times argues that the current RPZ system, which limits rent increases to inflation – or a maximum of 2 per cent, whichever is lower – should be replaced. Instead, a new system that pegs rent increases to nearby homes of a similar quality should be introduced, according to the report. Rent would not rise more than a set percentage above this level over a specified period, taking into account costs such as management and maintenance, interest rates and household incomes and affordability. It also argues that the State should “establish a publicly available register of rents being charged”. RPZs, it says, were introduced as a temporary measure eight years ago and now the “system of regulation needs to be made fit for purpose for the longer term”. The Cabinet this week agreed to extend the rules to the end of 2025. The report says that studies have suggested non-compliance with the rules is an issue in Ireland, and cites research that argues RPZs contribute to a “two tier” rental market with existing tenants enjoying lower rents and those seeking a home face “significantly higher” charges. It finds the methodology employed when extending the system to cover new areas is “not fit for purpose” and that the current approach leads to “inconsistencies and inequities”. Moving to reform the RPZs, which have become a core feature of the rental market in Ireland since their introduction and expansion over many areas, would likely spark significant debate over a replacement – just as the Government gears up for a series of elections where housing costs will be a key issue. The report also indicates that the recommendation split the commission, with three members – Ronan Lyons, Michael O’Flynn and Dermot O’Leary – arguing that there was a consensus in international research “in terms of the negative impact, in aggregate, of rent controls, especially quasi-permanent rent controls of the type proposed here”. They argued that rent controls within tenancies would be more effective and that aspects of the recommendation of the report would “adversely impact supply and it is therefore inconsistent with the conclusion of the commission elsewhere in the report”, adding that direct controls on rent should only apply as a temporary measure in specific locations “rather than a permanent system of rent determination as recommended here”. The report also recommends that the State should “amalgamate regulatory agencies involved in regulating rental accommodation” under a single authority “and strengthen the enforcement powers”. Taoiseach Simon Harris defended the Government’s progress on housing in the Dáil, pointing to record figures on housing commencements and social housing completions last year, denying that the Government was attempting to delay publication of the report until after next month’s local and European elections. The report found that there is an underlying housing deficit of 256,000 homes in Ireland and recommended that 20 per cent of the housing stock should be composed of social and affordable homes, as well as the establishment of a new Housing Deliver Oversight Executive and of high-yielding Housing Delivery Zones.",0,1
2024/5/23,"Israeli minister posts video of Irish dancers and Hamas fighters as Harris says  decision to recognise Palestine ‘no surprise’ Taoiseach insists move was an effort to ‘try and create momentum towards a peace process’ Israel would not have been “surprised” by the Government’s decision to officially recognise the state of Palestine, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. Mr Harris said he believed it was the “right decision” and was an effort to “try and create momentum towards a peace process, that may seem far away but is absolutely essentially needed”. Meanwhile an Israeli government minister claimed on Thursday Ireland’s decision was a reward for Hamas and posted a video edited to show Irish dancers and Hamas fighters as well as the Irish flag. “A two-state solution is the only way to bring peace and stability to the people of Israel and the people of Palestine,” Mr Harris told reporters in Dublin on Thursday morning as he arrived for the inaugural Child Poverty and Wellbeing Summit at Dublin Castle. “What I would say very clearly, to the Israeli government, is we very much recognise the state of Israel and its right to live in peace and security, but you can absolutely say that and also say the next bit - that the people of Palestine have a right to live in peace and security and that the humanitarian catastrophe that’s unfolding in Palestine, in Gaza, needs to end.” Mr Harris said he had a “very good conversation” with Israeli president Isaac Herzog last Friday, which was “firm but respectful”. “We exchanged views, I outlined the Irish position. So I don’t think anybody in the world, least of all Israel, would have been surprised by the decision that Ireland, Norway and Spain took yesterday,” he said. The Government’s decision to officially recognise the state of Palestine on Wednesday was widely welcomed by many civil society groups, Opposition parties and supporters of Palestine. However, Israel and its supporters fiercely criticised the move, with Israel’s minister of foreign affairs Israel Katz claiming in a post on X that it was a reward for Hamas. In the post Mr Katz tagged Mr Harris saying: “Ireland, if your goal was to reward terrorism by declaring support for a Palestinian state, you’ve achieved it. @SimonHarrisTD, Hamas thanks you for your service.” The post was accompanied by a video edited to show the Irish flag, Irish dancers and Hamas fighters with traditional Irish music playing over it. The Israeli response is expected to be discussed in the coming days when ambassador Dana Erlich returns to Jerusalem for consultations with the foreign ministry there. It is understood that options which include restricting access for Irish NGOs to the West Bank, and to Gaza after the conflict, will be on the table. Israel will reprimand the ambassadors of Ireland, Norway and Spain on Thursday over their governments’ plan to recognise a Palestinian state, an Israeli official said. The envoys have been summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, where they will be shown a previously unpublished video of Hamas taking female captives during its October 7th attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war, the official said. Israel has also recalled its own ambassadors in Dublin, Oslo and Madrid for consultations.",0,1
2024/5/23,"Taoiseach tells Israeli public: ‘IRA was never the people of Ireland and Hamas is not the people of Palestine’ Harris says in CNN interview that he would not tolerate any country misrepresenting the position of the Irish people Taoiseach Simon Harris has responded to Israel’s criticism of Ireland for recognising the Palestinian state with a message to the Israeli public, saying that Ireland acknowledges their right to peace and security and also that “the IRA was never the people of Ireland and Hamas is not the people of Palestine”. Ireland, Spain and Norway have all decided to recognise the state of Palestine, prompting the Israeli foreign ministry to reprimand their ambassadors during a meeting where the diplomats were also shown video footage of female Israeli soldiers being taken hostage by Hamas. During a CNN interview on Thursday evening, it was put to Mr Harris that the Israeli government’s view is that the recognition of the Palestinian state by the three European countries is a reward for Hamas. Mr Harris said he would not tolerate any country misrepresenting the position of the Irish people, adding: “We have been clear and unequivocal that we condemn Hamas, that we condemn the most horrific, barbaric massacre that Israel experienced on the 7th of October. “We call for the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages.” He said it was possible to say this and also say what “sadly some refuse to say” in relation to the Israeli response to the October 7th attack – that “what is happening in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe, that children are being starved ... and that there are children who will go to sleep in Gaza tonight not sure if they would wake in the morning. “This situation is not sustainable. It needs to stop.” He added: “I have no intention of being in any way shape or form distracted from the immediate need for a cessation of violence in the Middle East and the need for the release of the hostages for humanitarian aid to flow unimpeded ... and the need for a peace settlement.” Mr Harris also directed a message to the people of Israel, that Ireland recognises their state and “Israel’s right to live in peace and security.” He said: “The people of Palestine also must have an equivalent right to peace and security. “And let me also say this to the people of Israel. The Irish people know what it’s like to have their national identity hijacked by a terrorist organisation. The IRA was never the people of Ireland and Hamas is not the people of Palestine.” Mr Harris said he hopes Ireland’s recognition of the Palestinian state will encourage other countries to do the same and “Israel loses nothing by us recognising the state of Palestine”. He said it “a positive step towards peace”, that there is a need to stand by international law and human rights and “that means children in Israel, children in Palestine, having a right to live safely side by side in peace and security”. “Anything else in terms of videos from foreign ministries and the like is distracting from the very, very serious issues, the serious issue of the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding.” This remark was a reference to a social media post by Israel’s minister of foreign affairs Israel Katz, who claimed on X that Ireland’s recognition of Palestine was a reward for Hamas. The post was accompanied by a video edited to show the Irish flag, Irish dancers and Hamas fighters with traditional Irish music playing over it. Earlier on Thursday, Ireland’s ambassador to Israel Sonya McGuinness, along with the Spanish and Norwegian ambassadors, were summoned to Israel’s Foreign Affairs Ministry in Jerusalem over the three countries’ decision to recognise Palestine as a state. The ambassadors were shown a video of five women hostages being taken captive during the Hamas attacks on October 7th. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin criticised the manner in which the meeting was staged, with Israeli media filming the ambassadors as they watched the video footage. “We have a very strong ambassador I think she does a fantastic job in Israel, she’s fair but I think there has to be norms around how diplomats are treated and there has to be respect and I think today was very inappropriate and wrong but nonetheless we’ll continue to keep putting our point.” Mr Martin said it may not have been intended but “I have never before come across a situation where media are invited in to witness [a meeting of diplomats] in the manner that happened today”.",0,1
2024/5/24,"Israel to ‘review’ operation of Irish NGOs in Palestine as Martin says treatment of Ireland’s ambassador in Jerusalem ‘wrong’ Tánaiste criticises the manner in which Ireland’s ambassador to Israel was reprimanded in Jerusalem before Israeli media Israel plans to “review” Ireland’s diplomatic, economic and humanitarian activities within Israeli borders, the country’s ambassador in Dublin has said as political tensions rise over the Government’s recognition of the state of Palestine. In an interview with The Irish Times, Dana Erlich said there would be a review of bilateral relations – “diplomatic, security, economy, military, anything, intelligence – all of the range of aspects, and then we’ll see the different diplomatic tools that we might have – if it’s authorisations, accreditations, anything like that”. Asked about Irish non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating in Palestine, she said: “I don’t know because most steps are with government entities and government bodies, but... we need to review all of that,” she said, acknowledging that many NGOs are Government-funded. She was speaking as she prepared to return to Jerusalem for consultations with her government after Ireland’s decision, along with Spain and Norway, to officially recognise the state of Palestine. The announcement this week prompted the Israeli foreign ministry to reprimand their ambassadors during a meeting in Jerusalem on Thursday where the diplomats were also shown video footage of female Israeli soldiers being taken hostage by Hamas. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin criticised the manner in which the meeting was staged, with Israeli media filming the Irish ambassador Sonya McGuinness and her European counterparts as they watched the video footage. “We have a very strong ambassador I think she does a fantastic job in Israel, she’s fair but I think there has to be norms around how diplomats are treated and there has to be respect and I think today was very inappropriate and wrong but nonetheless we’ll continue to keep putting our point.” Mr Martin said it may not have been intended but “I have never before come across a situation where media are invited in to witness [a meeting of diplomats] in the manner that happened today”. Ms Erlich said Ireland had a “disproportionate obsession with Israel that we don’t see with any other country”. She also expressed worry and frustration with how Israel is perceived and portrayed in Ireland. “You can object to Israeli policy and the current government,” Ms Erlich said. “You can object to the steps taken by Israel. You can object to decisions. “But what we see here – the comments made by politicians, different initiatives spreading in civil society – it has gone beyond the normal criticism, it is a vilification of a whole society, which now is also translated to the Jewish community here. “We see the rise of anti-Semitism. And it is all connected. This is why yesterday’s step concerns us with the message it sends to Hamas, but also, me as ambassador, it concerns me about how Ireland sees Israel and the future of these relations.” In a CNN interview on Thursday evening, Taoiseach Simon Harris said he would not tolerate any country misrepresenting the position of the Irish people, adding: “We have been clear and unequivocal that we condemn Hamas, that we condemn the most horrific, barbaric massacre that Israel experienced on the 7th of October. “We call for the unconditional and immediate release of all hostages.” He said it was possible to say this and also say what “sadly some refuse to say” in relation to the Israeli response to the October 7th attack – that “what is happening in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe, that children are being starved ... and that there are children who will go to sleep in Gaza tonight not sure if they would wake in the morning”.",0,1
2024/5/24,"Tánaiste insists banning imports from illegal Israeli settlements breaches EU law Christian Aid and Labour question if Government’s position has changed following legal submission to ICJ case Tánaiste Micheál Martin has reiterated the Government’s insistence that a proposed law aimed at banning imports from illegal Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories would breach European Union legislation. It comes after humanitarian organisation Christian Aid and the Labour Party questioned whether the Government’s position had changed given Ireland’s recent submission to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) case on Israel’s policies and practices in the Occupied Territories. The Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 was first put forward by Independent Senator Frances Black. The Government has long said it cannot be implemented as trade is an EU competency. In the Government’s February submission to the ICJ, Attorney General Rossa Fanning said: “States are obliged not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel’s breach of its obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. “In Ireland’s view, these obligations require all States, as well as international organisations with external trade competence (in Ireland’s case, the EU), to review their trading relationships with the settlements in the OPT [Occupied Palestinian Territory]. “It requires them to take steps to prevent trade that assists in the maintenance of the situation created by the settlement activity, or that implicitly recognises or serves to entrench or legitimise Israel’s settlement or annexation of that territory.” Christian Aid’s head of policy Conor O’Neill highlighted this sector of Mr Fanning’s statement to the Labour Party. He argued that Mr Fanning’s statement means the Government is saying there is “a conflict between international law obligations (cease trade immediately) and EU law obligations (don’t cease trade alone), and Ireland is picking EU law”. “In such a situation international law must surely come out on top,” he said. Mr O’Neill told The Irish Times: “We would be within our rights to pass this bill” and “then let the question on EU law be ventilated and decided by the EU courts”. Labour leader Ivana Bacik said “the Attorney General’s intervention in February copperfastens just how untenable it is for the Government to continue relying on his old advice as a means of blocking the Occupied Territories Bill”. She said Ireland’s ICJ statements “jar with what the Government continues to insist remains the position [on the Occupied Territories Bill]”. A Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman said Tánaiste Micheál Martin addressed the issue in the Dáil, pointing to a written response from a question by Ms Bacik. In his reply, Mr Martin said Ireland’s ICJ submission “concluded that settlements and related activities have violated international law in a number of significant ways, and that settlement activity is being used to annex Palestinian territory and deny the Palestinian people their right to self-determination”. “Drawing on the Court’s case law, the submissions argue that states and international organisations like the EU that have legal competence to regulate trade with third countries should do this by reviewing their trading relationships with the settlements.” Mr Martin added that “competence for external trade policy lies exclusively with the European Union”. He said the EU already “applies a policy of differentiation to distinguish trade with Israel from trade with the settlements”. This policy does not ban the import of goods from the settlements but they are not entitled to benefit from any preferential treatment under the EU-Israel Association agreement. “Once the Court delivers its Advisory Opinion, which we expect will be in the coming months, we will engage at EU level to consider whether any further actions are necessary,” he said. Mr Martin said the “clear legal advice” is that the bill, in its current form, “is not compatible with EU law”.",0,1
2024/5/24,"Row erupts between candidate Niall Blaney and Tánaiste at Fianna Fáil European election launch Blaney and Martin in public disagreement over level of support offered by party on campaign trail Tensions over Fianna Fáil’s three-candidate strategy in the Midlands-North-West constituency spilt over at the party’s European elections launch on Friday. One of the candidates, Senator Niall Blaney, got into a public disagreement with Fianna Fáil leader, Tánaiste Micheál Martin, about the level of support he was getting from the party. The party’s membership had voted for Laois-Offaly TD Barry Cowen to be its candidate at a selection convention in February. Donegal-based Mr Blaney, who came second in that contest, and former Mayo TD Senator Lisa Chambers were later added to the ticket. Earlier this week, Mr Blaney released a statement saying that Fianna Fáil is in “panic mode” after picking three candidates to run in the vast constituency. Asked about tensions within the ticket, Mr Martin said it was “natural”. He said he canvassed with Mr Blaney and with two local election candidates in Cavan, and has committed to canvassing with Ms Chambers. Mr Martin denied it was a mistake to run three candidates, saying: “It’s a very large constituency and with very distinct geographies ... We believe we’ve made a correct decision in selecting three strong candidates who will compete strongly for seats.” During the press conference Ms Chambers and Mr Blaney were asked whether if they feel supported. Ms Chambers replied: “I don’t just feel supported. I am supported.” She suggested Fianna Fáil is “in the mix and competitive for two seats”, adding: “There’s healthy tensions within the party because our ticket is competitive.” Mr Blaney said: “Unfortunately I’m not getting the support the other candidates are getting ... and that’s a problem for me. “I have never gotten any opportunity to be on national television yet. I’m the only candidate of six [Fianna Fáil European candidates] that has been the case.” Mr Blaney said there is “a real opportunity now to take a seat in the Border and the Connacht counties, but we need equal support for the last two weeks. If the Tánaiste goes for a canvass, he goes for a canvass with all three ... I’m asking for equal opportunity and equal support”. Asked for a response Mr Martin said: “I canvassed with Niall – the only person yet I think I haven’t canvassed with is Lisa.” Mr Blaney chipped in: “Can I qualify that? The one with me was two other candidates, and I joined it.” Mr Martin replied: “But that’s what I’ve done with all the candidates. All the European candidates are with local election candidates [on canvasses].” Mr Martin added: “We will deal with how the campaign gets conducted after the press conference ... But there’s huge support for the candidates from the party.” It has not been the only instance of infighting in a constituency where Fianna Fáil does not currently have a seat. At the weekend, Ms Chambers criticised Mr Cowen for describing himself as the “lead candidate”. She called the remarks “dismissive and arrogant”. Responding on Friday, Mr Cowen explained that he said this as he was the only one selected by a convention, adding: “It doesn’t mean I’m not out there trying to win votes the same as everybody else.” Fianna Fáil’s other candidates in the European election are Billy Kelleher MEP and Cynthia Ní Mhurchú in the South constituency and Barry Andrews in Dublin. Fianna Fáil’s manifesto includes a pledge enter the EU Migration and Asylum Pact – which the Government has already confirmed it intends to do – and another to advocate for EU funds to invest in infrastructure and services in communities hosting asylum seekers. Mr Martin said he did not have “specifics” in relation to how much funding could be sought.",0,1
2024/5/25,"‘This is not how we wanted to recognise Palestine’: how Irish back-channel diplomacy built to a symbolic moment Months of co-ordination led to what is seen by participants as an imperfect attempt to revive moribund Middle Eastern peace hopes Almost exactly a month before the October 7th attacks, Micheál Martin met Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas at the Mukataa presidential compound in Ramallah. The Tánaiste was on a tour of Middle Eastern capitals, and Abbas and the Palestinian Authority were clearly under pressure. Earlier in the year, Palestinian and Israeli officials had met for the first time in years, but progress towards a Middle East peace deal seemed as remote as ever. On the same trip, the Irish delegation had met the Israeli government and formed the impression that the current Israeli government had no genuine interest in the long-mooted two-state solution that has anchored the diminishing hopes for a lasting peace in the region since the Oslo Accords of 1993. In Ramallah, one source recalls, there was a “lot of despair and disillusionment”. Abbas was said to be “complimentary” of Ireland’s position on Palestine, including its support for a two-state solution – but afterwards, the Tánaiste spoke about the need to develop a “critical mass” of EU countries that would take the action together. What Martin was outlining was long-standing Irish policy: the aim, as articulated in successive programmes for government, was to recognise Palestine. In truth, it was a stance, rather than a policy going anywhere fast. At different times over the years, momentum towards recognition had ebbed and flowed. However, there was always a reason not to act. Different peace plans in the region, the desire to maintain access and relations with Israel, the all-consuming focus on Ukraine. There were two pillars that determined how fast Ireland would go: officials were adamant Ireland would not move alone, and it was always tricky to align with other countries – fusing the domestic politics of different states, balancing bilateral relations and diverging foreign policy goals. Secondly, the Oslo peace accords always envisioned recognition of Palestine as coming late in a process leading towards a two-state solution, thereby validating a process approaching its climax. With progress towards that goal effectively moribund, recognition of Palestine was some way off. In his briefing to the press afterwards, Martin was typically moderate and incrementalist – urging people not to describe Israel as apartheid, talking up a structured dialogue process between the Palestinian Authority and the EU. But a month after Martin’s meeting with Abbas, the world changed. It also set in train a series of events that culminated on the steps of Government Buildings on Wednesday morning with Taoiseach Simon Harris announcing – in a meticulously co-ordinated move with Norway and Spain – that Ireland would now recognise Palestine. It was only days into the war in Gaza, but the conflict had already plainly exposed clear division in the European Union. “It wasn’t possible for months and months to agree a statement,” recalls one senior Irish source involved in talks. The then taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and his advisers were attending October’s Irish quarter-final of the Rugby World Cup, a pulsating match against the All Blacks culminating in another early exit from the competition for Ireland. Simultaneously, they were reviewing drafts of an EU statement to go out the following day. As the clash unfolded on the pitch, the taoiseach’s team were agog at what they believed to be a totally unbalanced statement. It was clear, in the view of one person familiar with discussions at the time, that “waiting for the entire bloc, we would be waiting for a very long time and it wasn’t a conscionable position to take that we should do nothing.” The following month, Varadkar attended a summit convened by French president Emmanuel Macron in the Élysée Palace on the humanitarian situation in Gaza. Macron greeted the arriving dignitaries, and they were guided into a gilded room to be seated at a table, surrounded by an outer ring of aid organisations and officials. The summary from people such as Mike Ryan of the WHO and UNRWA’s Philippe Lazzarini was deeply sobering, and contributed to a growing view on the Irish side that Gaza was in effect being “wiped out”, in the words of one senior official – as well as concern that the situation could spread into the West Bank and south Lebanon, where Irish peacekeepers were stationed. Against this backdrop, the idea of recognition began to gain more currency. “What it says,” recalls the same source, “is a number of countries are committed to recognising the state of Palestine, so it can’t be wiped out”. On the fringes, Varadkar met Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, who specifically mentioned recognition. Two senior sources last week pinpointed this as a moment when the Irish side began to think about moving more quickly. Martin, for his part, worked the room at the Foreign Affairs Council – the meetings of EU foreign ministers – speaking to counterparts on the edge of proceedings, probing their willingness. The shortlist included Spain, Slovenia, Belgium, Luxembourg and Malta. The hope was that synchronised recognition could shield countries from the backlash that Sweden suffered in 2014 from Israel when it acted alone. While the step would be in a way purely symbolic, the Irish view was increasingly that a comprehensive peace process was as far away as it had been for 20 years, and so the original plan had to be revised. Instead it could become a way to put pressure on Israel, and to begin building towards a critical mass that might culminate in about half of EU member states having recognised Palestine. Martin was engaged in bouts of shuttle diplomacy, returning to the Middle East in November. A big concern in the Government was also how the United States, Israel’s strongest supporter, would react. The Biden administration’s frustration with Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu was periodically clear, but Ireland nonetheless proceeded carefully through the embassy in Washington. The IDA, briefed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, sounded out the multinationals. No strong signal of dissatisfaction came back to Dublin from the political or business elites in America. Ireland believed the US could live with it. On January 21st, Martin hosted a dinner in Brussels of like-minded countries. By this point, a person familiar with events said it was possible to have a “real hard discussion about what you are prepared to do and when are you prepared to do it”. The dinner was an important moment, but events afterwards also showed how enthusiasm could wane in some capitals, and how difficult it was going to be to choreograph simultaneous recognition. Belgium faded away, feeling that holding the EU presidency precluded them from acting. Luxembourg’s foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, was replaced by the country’s former prime minister Xavier Bettel, thought by the Irish side to be less gung ho. At the Munich Security Conference in February, Martin held a key meeting with Norway where it was suddenly clear the Nordic country was game. Its cachet as an honest broker was clear. But even at that, the Irish side detected a moment of uncertainty from Oslo before the government headed by Jonas Store firmed up again. Another key factor was the emergence of an Arab Peace Initiative, which put an emphasis on recognition by European countries – seen by officials in Dublin as the only game in town. Martin continued working back channels in February, March and April. In February, Ireland and Spain wrote to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen seeking an urgent review of whether Israel was complying with human rights obligations under its EU trade agreement. The request ultimately dissipated – not a direct contributory factor towards the recognition move, but it emphasised for some on the Irish side that moves through the EU institutions could underwhelm. Two days after Varadkar announced he was stepping down as taoiseach, he signed a joint statement with Malta, Slovenia and Spain after talks on the margins of the European Council, stating they had “discussed together our readiness to recognise Palestine”. There was no timeline, but the gear shift was now publicly visible. In Dublin it was clear that Harris would succeed Varadkar. The Spanish side reached out to the presumptive taoiseach’s team, emphasising they wanted the first bilateral meeting to be with their prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. The pair met three times in 72 hours – in Brussels, and again in Warsaw at a mini-summit hosted by Donald Tusk, from which Harris returned to Dublin and Sanchez flew to Oslo, where he spoke with Norwegian premier Store, before coming to Dublin. By this stage Martin had told the Dáil – on the day of Harris’s election, with more than one observer noting the belief the Fianna Fáil leader was planting a flag in the process – that Ireland would recognise Palestine. The meeting between Harris and Sánchez was, in the words of a source present, a “one-issue” affair – entirely focused on recognition. Initially Ireland had been looking at late April to recognise, but the increasing likelihood of Norway coming on board slowed the process. On May 9th a leak to the Slovenian press caused consternation in Dublin as it identified May 21st as the likely date. It was true it was being examined, along with the 28th, but the choreography was getting ever tighter, with Spain and Norway, as well as Slovenia, having their own parliamentary and governmental hoops to jump through to secure recognition. The language began to narrow, with Harris by now promising recognition would come in May. Last weekend he had a long conversation with Store over the phone and on Saturday there was what one senior source described as a “moment of realisation” that it would be possible this week. Cabinet was briefed on Tuesday, before the three prime ministers exchanged a volley of “green light” texts that night. The Israeli reaction was swift and very public – the ambassador being temporarily recalled from each capital, seen as the minimum punishment. In Dublin, they are watching and waiting to see what comes next, with a severing of relations seen as an unlikely worst case. On Thursday the Israeli foreign ministry released a cutting video pointing out Hamas had thanked Ireland – seen as an unfortunate but inevitable development by Dublin. The démarche of the three ambassadors in Israel, where they were shown footage of October 7th and filmed themselves during the process, caused offence in Dublin, where Martin called it “wrong” and “inappropriate”. Within Government, nobody is so naive as to think this will change things overnight, but the hope is it may be a beginning of a lifeline thrown to a political process. “This is not how we wanted to recognise Palestine,” said one Coalition figure on Thursday. “We wanted to do it as a two-state solution. It’s done now for fear that a two-state solution may not be possible – in order to keep the hope alive.”",0,1
2024/5/26,"Election trail: Green Party back on the endangered species list after four years in Government The party has claimed policy wins since entering Coalition but retaining gains made in 2019′s local and European elections will be challenging  Scoil Iognáid in Galway is down at the end of a narrow street called Raleigh Row. The Gaelscoil is the first in the city with a traffic free, safe street for pupils going to school. The impact has been transformative. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan is on hand for the official opening of the kind of project championed by his party. Príomhoide Laoise Bhreathnach shows before and after photographs that juxtapose traffic chaos and traffic-free calm. Ryan, the Minister for Transport, talks about his ambition for this to happen at all schools. “You need to go for moonshots in your politics and life,” he tells the audience. Firing off moonshots, sometimes in the face of stark reality, is what Ryan’s political career has been all about. For example, the Green Party is running a record 129 candidates in the local elections. If history is telling the Greens anything, it is that the smallest party in a coalition takes a pasting, irrespective of how well the government performs. After going into coalition with Fianna Fáil in 2007, the party went on to lose 15 of its 18 council seats in 2009 and was wiped out completely in the 2011 general election. It has made a comeback since, with 49 councillors and two MEPs elected in 2019 and 12 TDs in 2020. Now back in Government, its opponents are predicting big Green losses. But Ryan is talking up their chances of gaining seats in the local elections. The party insists that this time is different. It’s bigger and more savvy, and climate change is on more peoples’ radars. It has more sway in Government and much more money to do green things with budgets running into billions for sustainable and active travel, public transport, agriculture, clean energy, the circular economy, the arts and heritage. And yet, and yet. Outside Dublin – particularly in rural Ireland – the party has been portrayed as a pantomime villain by its opponents – against roads; responsible for carbon tax and for fuel hikes; against turf-cutting; and even against rural Ireland. On canvass with the Greens in two of its stronger areas outside Dublin – Galway and Kilkenny – there is a clear sense the party will have its work cut out. Ryan joins European election candidate Pauline O’Reilly and city councillor Niall Murphy on the hustings in Glenard, a middle class area in Salthill. Murphy is a flame-haired man with an easy-going temperament. He has fought almost a lone battle on Galway City Council to get more cycle paths in the most traffic-clogged and bicycle-averse city in Ireland. In Dalton Drive, there is a conversation about cycling infrastructure. Ryan, whose department is responsible, tells the woman that because of the slow pace of implementation, “Galway has a real risk of falling behind other cities” in getting funding for sustainable and active travel. An exchange ensues, the pattern of which will be repeated – more or less – half a dozen times along this street. “Traffic in Galway is dire,” says the woman. “The only solution is more public transport,” says Ryan. “Public transport is dire,” says the woman. “We lived in Dublin for years and were shocked to see how bad it is.” O’Reilly explains that the problem partly stems from dealing with a conservative council and executive. The woman concludes, however, by pronouncing the need for the outer ring road. Ah, the ring road – aka the electoral albatross around the Greens’ neck. The party has opposed previous plans for it, a move which has not made it a friend of motorists. Ryan tells the woman better public transport and more cycle lanes would be the best way to take traffic off the roads as people would have an alternative. She looks unconvinced. As do others. Cllr Murphy chats to a man named Aidan who is standing in his driveway. He points across to Ryan and says: “Your man across the road has succeeded in stopping the ring road. Ye shafted it.” Further along Ryan meets Peter Murphy, who runs an electrical retail business. The Greens objected to the ring road, Murphy says, and he can no longer vote for the party. Ryan argues that allocating road space to cycling, walking and buses will take cars off the road. Peter Murphy responds by saying that the river divides Galway in two and a new bridge is needed nonetheless, given the population increase since the last bridge was built in the 1980s. A few others raise the ring road. Once that’s raised, you can chalk the person down as a doubtful. There are one or two householders who say cycle lanes are needed. But it’s not 50-50. “We knew from history as a smaller party in Government that this election would be tougher on the doors,” says Niall Murphy. “If you are an independent or in opposition, you will have it cushy as you have no responsibility. Traffic has been bad in Galway for decades. The idea of it being the Greens’ fault is ridiculous.” O’Reilly, standing in Midlands-North-West, is upbeat. She believes things are positive on the doors but many of her pledges are numbers twos. “It’s hard to gauge at this stage. We need to push people to give number ones. It’s more critical than ever for Greens to be elected in Europe,” she says. Malcolm Noonan won a Dáil seat in Kilkenny in 2020 and now serves as Minister of State for Heritage. He oversaw a big expansion of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, an ambitious Biodiversity Action Plan and secured an enormous new national park in the Dingle peninsula in Kerry. But does that butter any parsnips? We go to in Larchfield or the Village, where Noonan grew up, a neighbourhood abutted to the clubhouse of James Stephens, the famous GAA club of former Kilkenny player and manager Brian Cody. Noonan is canvassing with Cllr Maria Dollard, a disability advocate and community activist. She recounts an earlier canvass where she was chased down the street by a man standing some 6ft 4in in height, who she said continuously roared the “c” word and complained about migrants. Today’s walkabout passes without any drama. The issues are speeding cars, traffic, opportunistic parking, flooding and the 16-year wait for, you’ve guessed it, a ring road for the city. Noonan says the man who Dollard says chased her was not representative. “Migration is featuring on the doorsteps but not as much as some people think,” he says. “All that most people are looking for is a fair system.” His own sense is that many have suspended their final judgment on who they will vote for. “It’s hard to say. People are non-committal,” he adds, perhaps conceding it will be a battle for the Greens. Asked if the party can hold, or indeed gain, seats in the forthcoming elections, he gives a candid assessment: “We are consistently a party that wants to be in government. It’s the only way we can implement the fundamental changes that we need in this country. “And if we take a drubbing for that, then we take it, and we all come back again. I think we’re needed in our politics. And I think we’ve proven that over the last four years.”",0,1
2024/5/27,"Israel vents anger at Palestinian recognition through diplomacy and online videos Ireland, Spain and Norway to formalise decision on Tuesday As Ireland, Spain and Norway prepare to formalise their recognition of a Palestinian state, Israel has been stepping up reprisals against all three countries through diplomatic measures and online videos. Israel responded angrily to the preliminary announcement last week by the Irish, Spanish and Norwegian governments, with the country’s foreign minister, Yisrael Katz, describing it as “a parade of stupidity” and warning of “dire consequences”. Dublin, Madrid and Oslo are scheduled to confirm their recognition of the state of Palestine on Tuesday. All three governments have been facing a backlash from Israel in recent days. Their ambassadors in the country were all invited to watch video of the October 7th attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war and they received a reprimand from the country’s foreign ministry. Israeli media filmed the Irish ambassador Sonya McGuinness and her Spanish and Norwegian counterparts as they watched the footage. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin described the diplomats’ treatment as “inappropriate and very wrong”. However, the Israeli government has suggested that the action against Ireland might not end there. The Israeli ambassador to Ireland, Dana Erlich, told The Irish Times that there would be a review of bilateral relations, encompassing everything from intelligence and security to the economy. The Israeli response has also taken the form of garish online videos aimed at Ireland, Spain and Norway, portraying the decision to declare support for a Palestinian state as being favourable to Hamas. In one, published on the X platform and addressed to Taoiseach Simon Harris, apparent footage of Hamas fighters was interspersed with traditional Irish dancing as folk music played. “Ireland, if your goal was to reward terrorism by declaring support for a Palestinian state, you’ve achieved it,” wrote Mr Katz above the video. Similar videos were aimed at Norway and Spain, with the latter showing flamenco dancing. Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, reacted by describing the video as “execrable” for using a symbol of Spanish identity such as flamenco.  Relations between Spain and Israel have been fragile for several months. Socialist prime minister Pedro Sánchez has been one of the EU’s most outspoken critics of the Israeli response to the October 7th attack. Also, senior figures in the far-left Podemos party, which until late last year governed in coalition with Mr Sánchez’s socialists, have repeatedly called for Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu to be tried for human rights violations. Bilateral ties have deteriorated further in the hours leading up to the declaration of support for the Palestinian state, which Spain is due to make during a cabinet meeting. In a video recording about her support for the decision, Spain’s deputy prime minister Yolanda Díaz, of the left-wing Sumar platform, said: “Palestine will be free, from the river to the sea”. The Israeli government condemned her use of the phrase, which it deemed anti-Semitic. Meanwhile, Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, told an interviewer that “a veritable genocide” was taking place in Gaza, the first time a socialist member of Mr Sánchez’s government has used that term. Israel has taken further diplomatic action, announcing that the Spanish consulate in Jerusalem will no longer be allowed to conduct consular activities with or provide consular services to Palestinian residents of the occupied West Bank. “The days of the Inquisition are over,” Mr Katz wrote on X. “Today, the Jewish people have a sovereign and independent state, and no one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence – those who harm us, we will harm in return.” The foreign ministers of Ireland, Spain and Norway met in Brussels on Monday, agreeing to postpone any response to the Israeli actions until a later date. Earlier this month, the Spanish government denied permission to dock to a vessel sailing under the Danish flag because it was carrying armament from India to Haifa in Israel. Mr Albares said the decision was the first time Spain has refused entry to a vessel for this reason.",0,1
2024/5/27,"Possible sanctions on Israel discussed in ‘real way’ for first time at EU meeting  Micheál Martin condemns ‘barbaric’ Israeli air strikes on tents housing displaced people in Rafah   European Union foreign affairs ministers raised the prospect of placing sanctions on Israel in a “real way” for the first time over its continued military campaign in the besieged city of Rafah in Gaza, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said. At least 45 people were killed on Sunday night when an Israeli air strike hit tents housing displaced people in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which took place despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordering Israel to immediately halt its assault on the city. A meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers on Monday discussed the possibility of placing sanctions on Israel if its government continued to disregard the order of the United Nations court. Some ministers also raised the prospect of sanctioning Israeli government officials suspected of assisting violent settlers targeting Palestinians in the West Bank. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Martin said the recent air strikes in Rafah were “barbaric” and had led to a frank discussion about the EU taking stronger action against Israel. There were “very clear views” expressed by foreign ministers that Israel should adhere to the ICJ order to cease its military operation in Rafah, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said. “For the first time at an EU meeting in a real way I have seen significant discussion on sanctions,” he said. It was agreed the EU would raise its “grave concerns” and seek a response from Israel on whether it would comply with the international court order, he said. “There have been sanctions against Hamas in respect of its murderous activity. There have been sanctions against violent West Bank settlers,” he said. “People talked today about potentially [targeting] Israeli government officials who may be aiding and abetting those violent West Bank settlers,” he said. If there continued to be “a flagrant disregard” for the ICJ order to stop the assault in Rafah, the EU would have to consider taking action on a broader level, he said. Mr Martin noted there was a “long distance” between sanctions being discussed at a meeting and all member states agreeing to take action, given several countries remain ardent supporters of Israel. In response to criticism of the air strikes on an area designated for displaced people, the Israeli military said its air force struck a Hamas compound, but that it was examining reports a fire that started as a result of the strikes had injured civilians. Speaking earlier at a press conference in Brussels, Mr Martin said the portrayal of Ireland’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine as a reward for the terrorism of Hamas militants could not be further from the truth. The response of the Israeli government to the decision was “outside of diplomatic norms” and did not reflect well on Israel, he said. Mr Martin said aid agencies had all predicted that any military assault on Rafah would have “dire consequences” for Palestinian civilians. He reiterated calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages held by Hamas and a “massive surge” of humanitarian aid into the enclave. The Fianna Fáil leader was speaking alongside foreign ministers from Spain and Norway, who have decided to recognise the state of Palestine alongside Ireland’s decision to do the same. José Manuel Albares, Spanish foreign affairs minister, suggested the EU should consider taking action against Israel if it continued to ignore the recent ICJ court order. “I think that this time we have to raise our voice, not only for an immediate ceasefire, but also to back international law and the United Nations charter,” he said. He said he would raise the matter at a meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers to seek a statement backing the United Nations court. “If Israel continues to pursue [its assault] against that opinion of the International Court of Justice, that we try to take the right measures to enforce that decision,” he said. Espen Barth Eide, Norwegian foreign affairs minister, said the ongoing war in Gaza was a “low point” in the history of the Middle East. “We have extreme violence in Gaza, we have Israelis living in fear of terrorism and rocket attacks, and we have settler violence and the expansion of illegal settlements in West Bank,” he said. The Norwegian minister said too much space had been left for forces who did not want a two-state solution to “sabotage” the previous 1993 Oslo accord between Israel and Palestine. Mr Martin said he hoped a number of other EU countries would follow suit and recognise the state of Palestine. The effort was a step towards a “just and lasting solution”, where “occupation and terrorism, dispossession and displacement have no role and are given no space”, he said.",0,1
2024/5/27,"Israel warns of potential tech sector impact over Ireland’s Palestine stance Taoiseach dismisses Dana Erlich’s claims as a ‘distraction’ as Israeli military kills dozens in Rafah refugee camp The Government’s decision to recognise a Palestinian state sends the “wrong message” internationally about Ireland as a tech hub, Israel’s ambassador to Dublin has said, suggesting it will impact on foreign investment in the Irish technology sector. Dana Erlich’s claim was quickly rejected by Taoiseach Simon Harris who described the Israeli envoy’s comments as a “distraction”. Speaking in Jerusalem, where Ms Erlich has held foreign ministry consultations after being recalled in protest, she voiced hope of returning to Ireland, though she saw the Irish Government as siding with the Palestinians against Israel. The statehood recognition is due to be formalised on Tuesday by Ireland in conjunction with Spain and Norway. The move was denounced as a “reward for terrorism” by Israel, which is waging a devastating Gaza war and knock-on fighting on other fronts in response to the October 7th cross-border rampage by Hamas, the dominant Palestinian Islamist faction. Ms Erlich said all aspects of Israeli-Irish ties were under review but stopped short of predicting further action by her government, which has continued sparring with Madrid. “Ireland is not neutral or an honest broker in this case, because they are very supportive of the Palestinians. But what we are saying [is]: this is not the time for such announcement on recognition,” Ms Erlich said in an interview. Many Irish sympathise with Israel “behind the scenes”, she said: “I think there is a lot of potential in our bilateral relations, if it’s cybersecurity or healthcare, climate change. I hope to be given that opportunity to continue that.” But she said a public mood of hostility, which some Jews deem anti-Semitic, is making Israelis question their place in Ireland – a threat to tech services that account for the lion’s share of some $5 billion (€4.6 billion) in annual trade between the countries. “We are getting more and more phone calls and conversations of concerned people – if it’s Israelis who invest in Ireland and are concerned about their investment, if it’s Israelis who have relocated to Ireland into different tech companies and either are requesting to be relocated somewhere else or asking to return to Israel,” Ms Erlich said. “I think it sends the wrong message about the location and the centrality of Ireland as a tech hub when there are more and more people who are concerned about moving to Ireland. I don’t think that this is the message that Ireland wants to send to the world… And this is not what we want to see.” Asked about Ms Erlich’s comments on Monday, Mr Harris said: “I think it’s a distraction quite frankly… What we have decided to do is recognise the state of Palestine because we believe in a two-state solution. “We believe in the state of Israel and the state of Palestine living side by side in peace and stability. And we believe at a time when others are seeking to bomb that hope to oblivion that it’s more important than ever to keep that hope alive.” Speaking at the launch of Fine Gael’s local and European election manifestos, Mr Harris also criticised the Israeli attack on a refugee camp at Rafah in Gaza that occurred on Sunday night describing the killing of dozens of civilians as “barbaric”. Asked if he was disappointed by Ms Erlich’s remarks, Mr Harris said: “It’s up to the ambassador to say what the ambassador wished to say.” The business connection between Ireland and Israel has already been hit by the decision announced on February 5th by Israel’s national carrier, El Al, not to renew direct flights to Dublin that were launched last year, citing changes in customer demands since the Gaza war. The Government has rejected calls by pro-Palestinian activists to impose sanctions or an economic boycott on Israel. But on April 5th, Ireland said its €15 billion sovereign investment fund would divest from six Israeli companies, including some of its largest banks, over their activities in the occupied Palestinian territories. – Additional reporting Reuters",0,1
2024/5/27,"‘We are struggling to keep pace’: Harris cites rapid population growth in call for public service reform Taoiseach criticises ‘the bureaucracy, the red tape, the silos and the pass the parcel when it comes to disability services’ during conference speech The State needs to be reshaped to keep up with its growing population and this will involve public service reform as well as additional funding and staff, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. Addressing the National Economic Dialogue conference in Dublin on Monday, he also said people were “still hurting” as a result of the impact of inflation over recent years, and that the cost of living must still be a focus for the budget for next year . Speaking at the event, Minister for Finance Michael McGrath said there would be measures in the budget to support households, as well as a social welfare package. However, he said: “the emphasis should be on permanent changes to our expenditure and taxation framework rather than a large series of one-off measures”. Eamon Ryan, leader of the Green Party and Minister for Transport, suggested he favoured spending being prioritised on longer-term investments in areas such as housing and transport. He said the main test for the budget was that it must be progressive and give most help to those on the lowest incomes. “Whatever about tax breaks and all the promises about expenditure increases, we know, because we have agreed it with our Coalition colleagues, that if we do not meet that test, the budget won’t be agreed.” Mr Ryan also said farmers had to be paid more to give them an income for protecting nature. He also said for the Irish economy capital spending was key: in housing, water, energy and transport. The Minister for Public Expenditure, Paschal Donohoe, said the budget in the autumn would be “sensible and appropriate”, similar to the four others he and Mr McGrath had overseen during the current Government. Mr McGrath said the budget would be held at its regular time in early to mid-October. Mr Harris, in his address to the conference, said: “we need to ask what is the right size for the State and what is our vision for the public service”. “We are struggling to keep pace with a rapidly growing population. We need to right size the State – not in per capita terms but just to keep up.” “That means more public servants, more spending on capital infrastructure and public services.” “But it must mean more than that too. Spending more and recruiting more without reform is a wasted opportunity and it leaves us exposed for a time when money might not be so plentiful. "" Mr Harris said the economy and the public finances were in good health. Ireland had a record number of people at work, at just over 2.7 million, and job growth was taking place in every region, he said. He said inflation was moderating, with a marked downward trend since last year, and that real wages should grow again this year. However, he said that people were “still hurting”. He said the cost of living must once again be a focus for the budget for next year. Mr Harris said cost-of-living increases had left people feeling their personal finances were insecure and might not withstand any further shocks. “We need to give them a sense of security that the Government get this,” he said. The Taoiseach said he wanted Ireland to be the best country in which to be a child. He described this as Ireland’s moon shot. He said the improvement of disability would be a key focus for his Government. “We are nowhere near where we need to be in relation to this. I am acutely aware of the current challenges in children’s disability services and the difficulty in meeting demand. “I am fed up with the national game of pass the parcel and silos when it comes to children with disabilities. It is having a profound impact on children with disabilities,” Mr Harris said. “The parent does not care who provides the services. The child certainly does not care. And quite frankly, I don’t care. I have a low tolerance level for the bureaucracy, the red tape, the silos and the pass the parcel when it comes to disability services.”",0,1
2024/5/27,"Immigration is the top issue getting voters’ attention ahead of elections Housing and immigration are the major issues voters have noticed, according to the Irish Times/Ipsos B&A Snapshot poll Immigration and housing are dominating the list of the issues voters noticed about what the Government has done in the last month, according to the latest Irish Times/Ipsos B&A Snapshot poll. The research shows that the vast majority of respondents who cited immigration and housing as the issues they noticed, have a negative view of the Government’s performance. The monthly Snapshot seeks to gauge what voters are noticing about what the Government is doing and whether that pushes the country generally in the right or wrong direction. It comes two weeks ahead of the local and European elections, the first test at the polls for Simon Harris as Taoiseach. The poll shows that 29 per cent of respondents said that immigration was the issue they noticed the Government doing or saying something about in the past month. This was far ahead of housing (19 per cent), which has been the number one issue for most of the time since Ipsos B&A began measuring this data last summer. Housing and immigration are far ahead of other issues. Healthcare was cited by 4 per cent of respondents, while climate change/sustainability; the cost of living; social policies; the recent referendums; and the change of leadership in Fine Gael and the Government were mentioned by 3 per cent each. Just 2 per cent of respondents each mentioned the budget/spending; education; the economy; crime/gardaí; democracy/political process; and the Palestine-Israel conflict. The prominence of the immigration issue has surged by 17 points this month, up from 12 per cent in April. Housing remains largely steady, down by just two points. Housing has consistently been in the top two spots, whereas immigration rose to prominence in the second half of last year. The survey finds that the vast majority of comments made by participants are negative towards the Government’s performance. On immigration, just 14 per cent of comments were positive, with 85 per cent negative. On housing, the responses were even worse for the Government. Nine out of ten comments (90 per cent) were negative, with just 9 per cent positive. Today’s results come after a period in which immigration and asylum issues have frequently dominated the news agenda. The Government has toughening its stance on benefits for refugees and asylum seekers and there have been repeated clearances of tents where asylum seekers without accommodation have been living in Dublin city centre. Canvassers campaigning in the local and European elections in all parties say that the immigration issue is coming up incessantly on the doorsteps. The new survey asks more than 1,000 respondents the following question: “What have you come across in what the Government has said or done recently that has made you think the country is going in the right or wrong direction?” Their responses are then collated and sorted by issue and whether they view the Government in a positive or negative light as a result. A selection of their verbatim responses can be read below.

2024/5/27,"Lack of action on water charges seven years after special committee ‘beyond disappointing’ Independent Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh chaired a group that agreed households using 1.7 times the average annual water use should have to pay The former senator who chaired the committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water in 2017 has said it is “beyond disappointing” that seven years later nothing has happened to implement its findings, particularly imposing water charges on households which use excessive amounts. Pádraig Ó Céidigh, an independent senator between 2016 and 2020, chaired the all-party special committee which tried to come up with a consensus approach on how to fund domestic water services in Ireland. The 2016 election had been dominated by the issue after the previous government’s efforts to introduce water charges were met widespread protests and boycotts. The committee, which reported in 2017, recommended that households would not be liable to pay any water charges unless they were found to be using 1.7 times the average amount of water used by a household each year. That threshold for charging was set at 213,000 litres. Mr Ó Céidigh, a Galway businessman, said it was a “crying shame” that seven years later, little has happened and there is no sign of the committee’s recommendations being implemented. “It looks like the proposals have been thrown on the scrapheap. Obviously, the Government is not following the guidelines that were set out by the Committee and which were accepted by the Dáil and the Seanad. In my opinion, there has been no progress. “The Government is paying over €1 billion a year as support to Irish Water. There is no punishment for people who are wasting water. “This is such an important issue from an environmental perspective. It seems like they are throwing it on the scrapheap.” Mr Ó Céidigh worked full-time on finding a resolution for almost six months in late 2016 and 2017 and held countless meetings, hearings as well as going on site visits. The report, published in April 2017, recommended that the cost of domestic consumption of water services be met from general taxation rather than by means of direct charges on households, with the exception of levies or disincentives necessary to curb wasteful and excessive use of water services. This was enshrined in legislation later that year. The average water allowance for households was set at 125,000 litres. Any household using more than 1.7 times that amount, 213,000 litres for more, were to be charged. In 2019, the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities accepted those figures and also proposals that households with more than four occupants should be able to apply for an additional water allowance. Another exception was that those with medical needs should be able to apply for an exemption. However, the arrangement was never initiated as it depended on a Government decision that has still not been made five years later. Asked about the status of the charges, a spokeswoman for Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien said that draft regulations on the additional allowance and medical needs allowance are in development. “No charges will be implemented until this process has concluded.” The Department did not provide a date on when this process will be completed. Mr Ó Céidigh said a review of the report was due to take place after five years but it never happened. “It is beyond disappointing that nothing has happened after seven years,” he said. Spokespeople for Opposition parties expressed the view that the charges will never be implemented. Eoin Ó Broin of Sinn Féin said that domestic metered water charges were unnecessary and unwarranted. “This Government does not have a mandate to introduce them. Water services should continue to be funded through general taxation to ensure that people have access to water and wastewater services based on need and not ability to pay. “With respect to water conservation, the priority must be to reduce the high level of leakage within the water system through increased capital investment in upgrading the network. Sinn Féin will oppose any moves to introduce domestic charges and any move to privatise water services,” he said. Cian O’Callaghan of the Social Democrats said: “Water charges were comprehensively rejected by the Irish people so it will come as a surprise to many that a plan to introduce them is being quietly worked on. “Water must not be treated as a commodity. The commitment given years ago to hold a referendum to guarantee that water infrastructure remains in public ownership should be honoured.”",0,1
2024/5/27,"Smoky bacon flavouring ban: Coveney lobbied EU over ‘financial implications’ for Irish firms Kerry Group, which is one of the big players in smoked flavourings, claimed the changes ‘would impact’ more than €30bn worth of food products The Government raised concerns that a recent European Union ban on certain types of smoke flavouring added to ham, rashers and smoky bacon crisps could lead to hundreds of products being discontinued, correspondence shows. Last month, the EU approved a proposal to phase out various smoke flavourings currently added to meats and other food, such as sauces and crisps. Records show in the weeks beforehand, then minister for enterprise Simon Coveney lobbied for food producers to be given several years to stop using the current flavouring method. In a March 27th letter to Stella Kyriakides, EU commissioner for food safety, Mr Coveney said industry had warned the decision could lead to the “discontinuation of a wide range of products currently on the market”. There would be a “significant” impact on Irish food producers, particularly those in the meat-processing sector. “It is estimated that up to 300 products will be affected, with one individual company advising that 27 of their products would be affected,” he said. Previous EU authorisation for the smoke flavourings had been rolled over for a 10-year period, which was due to expire. The decision to not renew permission for the flavourings had been proposed by the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, and approved by countries, including Ireland, at committee level. The move was taken after the EU food safety authority concluded toxicity concerns about the flavourings were “either confirmed or can’t be ruled out”. The current process, which food producers state is healthier than traditional smoking, involves purifying smoke and removing harmful components such as tar and ash, before the flavouring is added to food. Producers will have two years to phase out the current method for adding smoke flavouring to crisps, sauces, soups and snacks, with a five-year window to stop using the method for flavouring ham, fish and cheese. An analysis by Teagasc, the agriculture development agency, indicated that coming up with a new “replacement additive” to give products a similar taste would be “an uncertain and complex process”, Mr Coveney said. The semi-State agency had advised “that it would be almost impossible for industry to replace the smoke flavourings within the next three to five years”. Mr Coveney told the EU commissioner it was “imperative” the period to phase out the current method was long enough to allow the sector develop new ways of adding the flavouring to food. A short transition period would have “significant” financial implications for Irish businesses and the availability of products, he wrote. His letter, released to The Irish Times under the Freedom of Information Act, said the Department of Health, who were leading on the policy area, had requested “a minimum transition period” of two years. Kerry Group previously warned the EU decision would cause “major economic harm” to the Irish food sector. In a January 30th letter to then taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the Tralee-based company said it estimated up to 40 per cent of the ham and bacon sold in Ireland depended on the flavouring method. Kerry Group, which is one of the big players in the smoked flavouring market, claimed the changes “would impact well over €30 billion worth of food products across the EU”.",0,1
2024/5/28,"Palestine and Ukraine flags to be flown side-by-side at Leinster House Ireland’s recognition of the state of Palestine takes effect on Tuesday with plans for beefed up diplomatic ties Ireland’s recognition of the state of Palestine takes effect on Tuesday and is being marked by the flying of the Palestinian flag alongside the Ukrainian flag outside Leinster House. Tánaiste Micheál Martin will bring plans to Cabinet on Tuesday to support the formal recognition of Palestine as a sovereign and independent state. He will outline to Ministers the logistics of how the Government intends to establish full diplomatic relations with Palestine, including through the upgrading of the Palestinian Mission in Ireland to an embassy. This will be subject to a formal request from the Palestinian authorities. The Representative Office of Ireland in Ramallah will also be upgraded to an embassy. An ambassador to Ireland from the state of Palestine will also be appointed after a formal request and Government approval. The current Irish representative to Palestine will also be changed to the Irish ambassador to the state of Palestine. Palestine’s ambassador to Ireland Dr Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid has said she is “looking forward to seeing the flag flying on Leinster House” on Tuesday, describing it as “a big moment”. A spokeswoman for the Oireachtas said the Palestinian flag “will fly alongside the Ukrainian flag on the Merrion side of the House”. Mr Martin will tell Cabinet that Ireland’s “clear and consistent position over recent decades has been for the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory to end, and for Palestinians to enjoy the same freedom and right to self-determination as others”. He is also expected to point out that Ireland was the first EU member state to endorse the idea of Palestinian statehood in 1980. The Programme for Government states that Ireland will “recognise the State of Palestine as part of a lasting settlement of the conflict, or in advance of that, when we believe doing so will progress efforts to reach a two-State solution or protect the integrity of Palestinian territory”. The Government will be asked to recognise the State of Palestine as a sovereign, independent State, within the territory defined by the 1967 borders referenced in a United Nations Security Council resolution. Separately, Mr Martin will also seek approval for a counter motion on a People Before Profit private members motion on neutrality which will be debated in the Dáil on Wednesday. People Before Profit’s motion calls on the Government to withdraw plans to end the triple lock, and to hold a referendum enshrining neutrality in the Constitution, as well as ending the use of Shannon Airport by the US military. In response, the Tánaiste will outline the work of the recommendations of the Consultative Forum on International Security Policy last June, and point to the fact that the Triple Lock currently gives a veto to UNSC members such as Russia. He will argue that existing legislation already requires all foreign military aircraft wishing to overfly, or land in, the State obtain diplomatic clearance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.",0,1
2024/5/28,"Ireland has taken a rare diplomatic lead by recognising Palestine but what will it achieve? There is no mistaking the message of the Palestinian flag flying at Leinster House - Ireland stands with Palestinians now more than ever The passersby on Kildare Street were looking for the Palestinian flag flying at Leinster House. “Where is it?” asked one. “I can’t see it.” “It might be around the other side,” his companion replied. It was. It was flying alongside the EU and Ukrainian flags. Inside the Dáil Taoiseach Simon Harris said it was about “keeping hope alive”. The Tánaiste Micheál Martin had a more forward-looking warning for Israel. “I am encouraged that we are now beginning to see a clear view emerging amongst member states that it is simply not credible that the EU-Israel relationship can remain entirely unaffected by the behaviour of this Israeli government.” Palestinian ambassador Jilan Abdalmajid was applauded by all sides in the Chamber. It was one of those Dáil debates in which everyone more or less agrees with anyone else. But will the recognition achieve anything? “In concert with others, yes it will,” says UCD professor of international relations Ben Tonra. “There’s a momentum there now,” he adds, citing the possibility that Belgium and Slovenia may follow at some point in the future. Even France, he says, is “in play”. “The European ground has been shifting for some time.” For Gezim Visoka, an assistant professor of peace and conflict studies in DCU, the move is “opening a new chapter in how the international community sees the Palestinian question”. “It opens a path for Palestine to receive new forms of support and protection, for example, in state-building,” he says. But there is little prospect for the immediate future of EU sanctions against Israel. Support for Israel – albeit combined with disapproval at the continuing campaign in Gaza, and especially the killing of civilians in an air strike on a refugee camp in Rafah earlier this week – remains strong in some capitals and in the EU institutions. Ireland has been calling for a review of the EU-Israel agreement, which would be a precursor to sanctions, for months now. And while there is no indication that the Irish point of view will achieve a breakthrough there is also no doubt that the EU’s collective position – insofar as it can be said to have one – has moved to a more Israel-critical position. Has Ireland made an enemy of Israel? “We have certainly made an enemy of Netanyahu and those around him,” says Tonra. “The EU is gradually dissociating itself from the Netanyahu government,” says Visoka. “It’s an anti-Netanyahu move.” It is also a pretty rare example of Ireland taking a leadership position among EU countries on the issue. “It’s not a small thing,” says Tonra. “Boldness is not exactly a characteristic of Irish diplomacy.” Dublin insists that the recognition is intended as an aid to peace. The Israelis respond by asking how something intended as a contribution to peace could be welcomed by Hamas (as the Irish recognition was), an organisation dedicated to the violent destruction of their country. The answer seems to be that the Irish Government decided that giving Hamas a boost was an acceptable price to pay for the censure of Israel that is the real point of the recognition. It is prompted above all by a desire to say to Israel that its destruction of Hamas in Gaza and the fearful toll in civilian casualties is not acceptable, that it should be condemned by Israel’s allies and, furthermore, that Ireland will be active in the Palestinian cause. It is not just a gesture; it is a signal of intent. Both Taoiseach and Tánaiste were careful to emphasise the Irish Government’s opposition to Hamas and their absolute acceptance of Israel’s entitlement to protect its citizens. The Ceann Comhairle stressed, in advance of the Dáil statements, that the Dáil “cherished” the Irish Jewish community. But there is no mistaking the message of the flag flying at Leinster House, the debate inside, and the position of the Government: Ireland stands with the Palestinians, now more than ever.",0,1
2024/5/29,"Minister pledges ‘legal mechanisms’ within six months to allow random weapons checks on aircraft Eamon Ryan says it is ‘possible, timely and appropriate’ to develop rules to allow searches in ‘an appropriate manner that does not weaken or damage our diplomatic relations’ Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has pledged to “develop the legal mechanisms” within six months to allow random routine checks of aircraft for illegal weapons. He said it is “possible, timely and appropriate” to develop rules to allow searches in “an appropriate manner that does not weaken or damage our diplomatic relations but, rather, does the exact opposite”. The Minister was responding in the Seanad to the introduction of the Air Navigation and Transport (Arms Embargo) Bill, introduced by Independent Senator Alice Mary Higgins of the Civil Engagement group, which aims to ensure compulsory checks on flights. The Upper House agreed by 22 votes to 12 to delay the passage of her Bill for six months while the Minister developed the “legal mechanisms” to allow for random routine checks of civilian aircraft. Ms Higgins said a delay of six months “is hundreds of nights of terror for the people of Gaza. It is six more months when Ireland does not know how complicit we might be.” Later, outside the Seanad, the Minister stated he would introduce legislation for checks of civilian aircraft and that “no airport in Ireland, or Irish sovereign airspace, has been used to transport weapons directly to Israel”. Ms Higgins had told the Seanad that “even though the regulations allow for inspections, they are not happening. Under this Government, since 2020, there have been zero inspections of planes which we know, because they sought exemptions, are carrying weapons, munitions or dangerous goods.” The Bill would ensure there are no more “exemptions on flights either bringing these dangerous goods and weapons directly to Israel, or bringing them to or from the countries supplying arms to Israel”. “To be clear, the majority of exemptions have been given to the United States and Germany, which are the largest arms suppliers to Israel,” Ms Higgins said. “Germany went from €32 million in arms exports to Israel in 2022 to a tenfold increase, with more than €300 million in arms sent to Israel during this brutal attack on Gaza. In such a context it is unconscionable that we could be part of this arms supply chain.” Mr Ryan said the State granted 1,185 exemptions last year, adding that “on a small number of occasions exemptions  are not granted” if aircraft are carrying more than personal weapons. He said personal weapons could be carried for a variety of different reasons. “You might have a personal protection officer accompanying a diplomat, head of state, or whatever.” “Of the 1,185 exemptions granted last year, 275 of these aircraft landed in Ireland. A further 309 of the exemptions were granted to Irish-registered aircraft operating entirely outside of Ireland and Irish airspace.” The Minister stressed that “they are not allowed to fly with any weapon without that exemption. The procedure in place is well-understood and we have no evidence of any non-compliance.” Ms Higgins pointed to countries such as the Netherlands which introduced new measures to respond to the UN Human Rights Council, “which has directly called for an arms embargo on Israel at this time. We already have a tool in place that we do not use adequately. “This is why the Bill is necessary. Under the existing legislation, the Minister has the discretion to grant exemptions. I am sure when it was originally drafted it was envisaged the exemptions would be rare, but exemptions have become the rule.” Independent Senator Lynn Ruane said Mr Ryan knew he should be carrying out inspections and not “granting exemptions, carte blanche. Every unchecked aircraft is as good as putting Ireland’s signature or stamp of approval on a missile.” The Minister, however, insisted “there is no carte blanche. There are  occasions on which we say ‘No’.”",0,1
2024/5/29,"Drivers involved in serious road crashes to be tested on roadside for drugs from this weekend  Minister of State for Transport Jack Chambers due to sign into law aspects of the Road Traffic Act 2024 dealing with the testing on Wednesday New laws requiring drivers involved in serious road crashes to be tested for drugs on the roadside will be in force for the June bank holiday weekend. Minister of State for Transport Jack Chambers is due to sign into law aspects of the Road Traffic Act 2024 dealing with the testing on Wednesday, coming into effect on May 31st at midnight. Signed by the President last month, the Act is being viewed by Government as a key part of its response to the rising number of road fatalities in recent years. As of Tuesday morning 79 people have died so far in 2024. The legislation is being implemented in stages, targeting key areas linked to dangerous driving behaviour. “The signing of the ‘mandatory drug testing’ provisions into law is an important milestone in our response to the trends we are witnessing on our roads,” Mr Chambers said. Government is committed to doing all it can to reverse the “really alarming trends” seen in recent times, he said, where fatalities have been rising year-on-year. This aspect of the law will require members of An Garda Síochána to test drivers involved in serious collisions for the presence of drugs, following a similar requirement for mandatory alcohol testing. While this testing has already been carried out in the past, gardaí have had a discretionary power to do so. This will shift that to a legal obligation. The Department of Transport recently sanctioned the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to purchase an additional 10,000 DrugWipe test kits this year, the equipment used to detect drugs. The new order also sets a maximum waiting period of 30 minutes for roadside drug testing, beginning once a driver has supplied an oral fluid sample. In some cases this would allow for the results of the test to develop, usually taking about eight minutes, and for an additional test to be conducted if required.",0,1
2024/5/30,"Taoiseach expresses ‘serious concerns’ to Lebanese PM about Seán Rooney murder trial delays Simon Harris tells Najib Mikati there are frustrations in Dublin that four suspects are still at large Taoiseach Simon Harris has expressed “serious concerns” with Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati at delays in the main suspect in the murder of Private Seán Rooney appearing in court. Pte Rooney (24), from Dundalk, Co Louth, was killed during a gun attack on a convoy of Irish soldiers serving with the United Nations peacekeeping force in south Lebanon in December 2022. Trooper Shane Kearney, from Killeagh, Co Cork, was seriously injured in the same attack. Muhammad Ayyad has been charged with multiple offences relating to the attack, which occurred in the Lebanese town of Al-Aqbiya, but he failed to attend a hearing at the military tribunal in Lebanon in December, citing medical reasons. He was subsequently granted bail after spending almost a year in detention while the Lebanese investigation proceeded. During an earlier hearing, Mr Ayyad admitted to firing a gun during the attack but denied an allegation made in the military court’s indictment that he was a member of the Shia militant group Hizbullah which dominates south Lebanon. Mr Harris spoke to Mr Mikati by telephone on Thursday, during which he told the prime minister there were “serious concerns in Ireland with delays to date in the main suspect in the murder appearing in court”, a spokesman for the Government said. The whereabouts of the four other accused, Hussein Salman, Ali Salman, Mustafa Salman and Ali Khalifeh, is unknown. On this, the Taoiseach “expressed frustration at suspects remaining at large”, said the spokesman. “The Taoiseach said he hoped a scheduled court hearing next week would proceed, and that justice being done was essential for the families of Seán Rooney and Shane Kearney, as well as all peacekeepers in the region,” he added. Mr Harris and Mr Mikati also discussed the conflict in the Middle East, Ireland’s recognition of Palestine, and the wider the work of Irish peacekeepers in Southern Lebanon. “The Taoiseach spoke of Ireland’s belief in a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine and said Ireland recognised the state of Palestine this week to keep that hope alive,” said the Government spokesman. “He reiterated the need for a sustained ceasefire, the release of hostages and for unhindered access for aid to Gaza.”",0,1
2024/5/30,"‘Highly ironic’ severest critics of Israeli violence have ‘no problem’ with IRA, says FF Senator Ned O’Sullivan says if people ‘condemn what’s happening in Gaza’ they cannot embrace ‘the people who murdered’ Det Garda Jerry O’Sullivan Fianna Fáil Senator Ned O’Sullivan has said it is “highly ironic” that those most outraged by the violence and atrocities perpetrated in Gaza have no problem with “commemoration services for the Provisional IRA”. He said that “we have to be consistent here. If you are going to stand up and condemn what is happening in Rafah, then you cannot be embracing and welcoming the people who murdered my friend, Jerry McCabe,” in reference to the Garda shot dead by the IRA in a post office raid in 1996. Mr O’Sullivan found it “highly ironic that a great number of the people who are most vociferous in their condemnation of the violence and atrocities being perpetrated in Gaza have no problem countenancing commemoration services for the Provisional IRA people who massacred thousands of people in our own country, including thousands of people of the Catholic faith, and who seem to have no difficulty in balancing those two.” He also said that if Hamas released their hostages in the morning “I believe we would have peace and we would get a ceasefire. Why do they not release their hostages? They are treating people like animals in caves, we do not know what they are doing. Their parents and their families do not know if the hostages are dead or alive. Let us talk about that in this House. Let us have a bit of balance.” Speaking during a debate on legislation to make security checks compulsory on aircraft passing through Ireland to ensure they are not carrying munitions illegally, the Kerry Senator described himself as “somewhat of an outlier” on the Israeli-Hamas conflict. He did not “begrudge the achievement of the Palestinian people in securing recognition for a Palestinian state”, even though it was unclear “what kind of a state this is, where it is going to be located and many other aspects about it”. The Listowel-based Senator said the Government and his party leader Tánaiste Micheál Martin “are acting in what they consider to be the best interests of peace in the Middle East” but he had serious reservations about the timing of the decision. “There is every danger that Hamas is perceiving it right now as a reward for what it carried out on 7th October”, adding that the current round of the “age-old conflict” was started by Hamas. “It sickens me to see the video clips of what they did to young, vibrant women out celebrating a concert. They were humiliated, degraded, raped. “Unfortunately they got cheers for doing that from a large sector of the Palestinian community. I think that must be borne in mind also by the pro-Palestinian lobby here.” Mr O’Sullivan said “we seem to have a fixation for violence in one specific geographic location only”. One of the upsides of recognition of Palestine however is that “we now have the moral right to approach the people of Palestine and encourage them to hold elections,” because it was so long since they last held them. “We are very critical of Israel. Israel is a democracy. Israel has elections. Mr (Binyamin) Netanyahu, whatever you may think of him, was democratically elected. You cannot say the same of the leaders of Hamas, Hizbullah or any of the rest of them.” Mr O’Sullivan added that Hamas “has no solution whatsoever to the Middle East only the entire destruction of the Israeli people. That is a fact. You may look around and open your eyes at me and all the rest of it but that is an actual fact. They want to annihilate Israel.” He offered his “sympathy to the Jewish community living in this country and in this city. We know what they are enduring. We know the worries and fears their children have going to school.” And he told the Upper House he totally disagreed with the recent statement by President Michael D Higgins on anti-Semitism and agreed entirely with the new Chief Rabbi. President Higgins described claims of anti-Semitism in Ireland as “irresponsible”. It was “absolutely outrageous to be abusing the Jewish community” by saying that there is widespread anti-Semitism. “I don’t think it is helpful if people representing the Jewish state seek to encourage fear where it doesn’t exist by saying to people: ‘All of us now and anyone of Jewish faith must feel afraid’; that is grossly irresponsible,” he said. Chief Rabbi Yoni Wieder challenged the President and said however that Jewish families who had lived in Ireland for “six, seven, eight generations” had told him that never before had they felt such a “tension” or “their viewpoint as Jewish people so delegitimised”.",0,1
2024/5/31,"Donohoe, Varadkar and Coveney to attend Bilderberg meeting in Madrid Minister for Public Expenditure taking part as Eurogroup head, while former taoiseach says he will be going at own expense Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe and former taoiseach Leo Varadkar are due to attend a conference of the Bilderberg Group in Madrid this week. Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary is also listed as a participant, as is Fine Gael’s Simon Coveney. The Bilderberg Group describes the meeting as “an annual three-day forum for informal discussions designed to foster dialogue between Europe and North America”. Critics have accused the organisation of being secretive and elitist. Mr Varadkar told The Irish Times on Thursday that he had never been to a Bilderberg group conference previously. “[I] was happy to get the invitation and see for myself if it’s a good event. I am doing so at my own expense in my own time,” he said. A spokeswoman for Mr Donohoe said he would be attending the conference in his capacity as president of the Eurogroup. The private Bilderberg group conference in Madrid is due to consider geopolitical issues such as Ukraine and Russia as well as the Middle East and the US political situation in advance of the presidential election in November. Other topics for discussion include the “future of warfare”, Europe’s economic challenges, climate, the changing face of biology and artificial intelligence. Its meetings are held under “Chatham House Rules”, which means participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of any speaker or other participant may be revealed. Among those scheduled to take part in the meeting this weekend are Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg; former CIA chief David Petraeus; Wendy Sherman, former US deputy secretary of state; Thomas Wright, senior director for strategic planning at the National Security Council at the White House in Washington; Richard Phillips of the office of the director of national intelligence in the United States and Jonathan Finer, deputy US national security adviser. Other political figures scheduled to attend are Charles Michel, president of the European Council, the prime minister of the Netherlands Mark Rutte and European commissioner Maroš Šefčovič. From the business world those listed as taking part includes US billionaire investor Peter Thiel; Wael Sawan, chief executive of oil company Shell; Jane Fraser, chief executive of global bank Citi and Albert Bourla, the chairman and chief executive of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The participation by Irish politicians at meetings of the Bilderberg group has been controversial in the past. In the 1980s the then taoiseach Garret FitzGerald was criticised by Fianna Fáil leader Charles Haughey and by then Workers Party TD Proinsias De Rossa for taking part in a Bilderberg meeting in New York. Dr FitzGerald told the Dáil in 1985 that the idea that the Bilderberg meeting represented “a sinister – or even a secret – plot to undermine the neutrality of non-members of the North-Atlantic Alliance or democracy in the West would come as a very big surprise indeed to the members of Government of other neutral countries”.",0,1
2024/5/31,"Prime Time debate: Nobody likes Von der Leyen and four other takeaways from European election special Last night’s South constituency debate was relatively low key with the only real verbal skirmishes towards the end After the periodic mayhem of the Midlands North West RTÉ debate, last night’s Ireland South election debate was relatively low key with the only real verbal skirmishes occurring towards the end. Initially the two-presenter format looked a bit strange, but Fran McNulty and Miriam O’Callaghan segued well and kept the reins tight on the four key themes – migration, agriculture, neutrality, and the final busking section where each candidate was asked a hard question. All of the eight acquitted themselves well enough, which is also saying something, but none shot the lights out. The most consistent – and possibly the most effective of the eight – may have been Labour candidate Niamh Hourigan who managed to be both punchy and charming in her contributions. On migration, Independent candidate Michael McNamara was the most in favour of curbs, but it did not mean there was much clear blue water between him and the rest. He wanted an end to delays in processing and a more efficient system. Against that, he said Ireland should have a more generous visa permits system which – in a stroke – removed any label of anti-migrant. None of the candidates were fully comfortable with the EU asylum pact. Several pointed to the detention centres planned for EU countries and non-EU countries such as Egypt and Tunisia. Sinn Féin’s Paul Gavan drew a graphic picture of a detention centre in Hungary where children were kept in a cage and not let out for a six-month period. Lorna Bogue of Rabharta said the pact was a “hodge podge” and would be using countries that were external to the EU as detention centres, drawing comparisons with the UK’s use of Rwanda. Mick Wallace, wearing his customary pink T-shirt, said it was a pushback treaty of the kind that leads to the drowning of thousands of people in the Mediterranean. Bogue and Wallace opposed it. McNamara and Hourigan supported aspects of it, as did Gavan. The Government MEPs Billy Kelleher of Fianna Fáil and John Mullins supported it albeit with reservations. Grace O’Sullivan was left more in a bind. She admitted she had grave concerns on some aspects, especially that EU money would pay countries like Egypt to handle migration. But it was put to her the Government of which the Green Party was a member would support it. She replied: “I will be the wasp in Eamon Ryan’s and Roderic O’Gorman’s ears to make sure we have a humanitarian approach.” It’s an uncomfortable place to be. South has much of Ireland’s agricultural heartland, and it was no surprise farming featured heavily. It was the Greens versus the rest, with a twist. The questions cycled through nitrates, herd culling and the EU Nature Restoration Law. Grace O’Sullivan had her best moment here. She lifted a vial of water from her own home tap that she said contained nitrates. She argued Ireland was the last county in the EU to keep the derogation. “There are nitrates in my water. I don’t want my water contaminated.” She said she would only support the nitrates derogation (which is mainly used by intensive-dairy farmers) if farmers could show they do not pollute the water. Good answer. There was magical thinking from some candidates on that score. Kelleher said it would be possible to maintain output while introducing measures that would impact positively on water quality. He argued that 7,400 farmers would be affected if the derogation was not granted. “You are not just culling cattle, it would also cull farms and it would cull families.” Best soundbite of the night. Others questioned the basis for testing water for nitrates. Not enough was being done, said Mullins. “There is a lazy assumption that dairy farmers are causing it,” declared McNamara. Not a lazy assumption at all. Dr Eimear Cotter, director of the EPA’s Office of Evidence and Assessment, said “its assessment was based on specific criteria set by the commission under a 2022 Commission Implementing Decision”. She said the most recent assessments show only 54 per cent of surface waters – rivers, lakes and estuaries – were in a satisfactory condition, “which means that a large number are not in good ecological health”. She said “the picture for our estuaries is even more stark with only 36 per cent in satisfactory ecological condition”. And the cause? Dr Cotter said agricultural activity was one of the main sources of nutrient losses to water in Ireland and was a significant pressure on about 1,000 water bodies. “As well as being too high, nitrogen levels in groundwaters, rivers and estuaries have increased over the last 10 years since their lowest point in 2012-2013,” she said. So, that’s definite then. Farming has nothing to do with it. Billy Kelleher said straight out he would not vote for Ursula von der Leyen if she was nominated for a second term as EU Commission president. It could put him at odds with the Government. Paul Gavan tried to call him out on that, but Kelleher insisted he would vote against her. The debate on foreign policy, neutrality and the triple lock divided along party lines. Gavan, Bogue and Hourigan opposed any changes to neutrality. Hourigan reminded people the guarantee on the lock was central to the Nice and Lisbon treaties. Miriam O’Callaghan asked the candidates what they would do if another European country was invaded. Hourigan said that Nato existed for any member state that feared invasion (a bit of a side-dodge there because if Nato is the answer, the question might be, how do you guarantee placing yourself under the direct influence of US foreign policy?). Bogue did not believe any other EU state was under immediate threat. Her point was: “I think it is not correct as a sovereign State to change international policy every time there is a conflict in the world.” The Government candidates favoured a change. O’Sullivan said the triple lock was not functioning. She said if the Arab League asked Irish peacekeepers into Gaza, they could not go if the United States blocked the mission. Asked why he was one of 13 MEPs (alongside Clare Daly) out of 705 who voted against a parliament resolution condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Wallace insisted he had condemned the Russian invasion but could not support the resolution because it proposed flooding Ukraine with weapons. Putin should be held to account he said but in the same breath said he wanted the United States held to account. All sort of ambivalent. He finished with a harsh double barb at Fine Gael and von der Leyen. “A vote for Fine Gael is a vote for Ursula von der Leyen who is a warmonger and a nasty piece of work.” No ambivalence there. Whatsoever. The final round asked candidates personal questions. Wallace was asked did he regret that he has been perceived as pro Russian. Strangely, his answer was to have a cut at this newspaper. “We have no regrets about speaking the truth. We have spoken the truth from day one. There’s no point getting the news from the mainstream. Don’t read The Irish Times, check what we are saying and doing in the parliament itself.” Ouch. And while you are at it, especially don’t read any of the many excellent investigations by Naomi O’Leary into Wallace and Daly and their rather unusual worldview. The interviewers hit a bit of bum note with Billy Kelleher. There were rumours, said O’Callaghan, that he was opposed to Cynthia Ní Mhurchú being the second name on the ticket. He batted it away effortlessly. Rumours? Rumours? Not true. Always going to be two candidates. Constituency split geographically. Nothing to see here. Paul Gavan was asked if Sinn Féin was the party of flip-flops given its big pivots on nature restoration and migration? His reply was to an unasked question as he condemned Kelleher, Mullin and McNamara for being right-wing politicians. That prompted the only real verbals of the night when McNamara came in quickly to challenge that description. When Gavan claimed McNamara had supported Irish Water and water charges, McNamara responded forcibly that he never voted for Irish Water and never voted for water charges. Another moment for fact checkers. John Mullin was asked the hardly embarrassing question of having a potential conflict of interest in the parliament because he was a renewable energy entrepreneur. He was walking away from the business, was his reply. That was that. Until Miriam told him that he was a bit under time-wise. So she asked the same question again, and he gave the same answer. The overall takeaway was we learned a little at least about where the candidates stand on the key issues that will define this election.",0,1
2024/5/31,"Politicians, officials in breach of lobbying rules to be fined up to €25,000 New measures to allow for the imposition of sanctions, including a ban on lobbying for two years, to come into effect from this weekend Former Ministers, political advisers and senior officials could in future face fines of up to €25,000 if they breach rules on lobbying those in government with whom they had previously worked. New measures to come into force on Saturday could also see those who do not comply with the required “cooling off” period after leaving government employment banned from lobbying for up to two years. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said provision for the new sanctions came from the remaining parts of lobbying legislation which will come into operation from June 1st. Under legislation introduced in 2015 certain individuals including Ministers, Minister of State, special advisers and prescribed public servants are banned from engaging in lobbying former colleagues for a year after leaving off unless they receive permission from the Standards in Public Office (Sipo). For the duration of this “cooling off” period, they are not allowed to carry on lobbying activities in certain circumstances or be employed by, or provide services to, a person carrying on lobbying activities in certain circumstances. Under the measures to come into effect on Saturday it will also be a breach of the legislation for a person to take any action that has the intended purpose of avoiding the obligations to either register or submit lobbying returns to Sipo. Mr Donohoe said on Thursday that the parts of the legislation that will come into operation on Saturday “will promote compliance by ensuring proportionate sanctions are in place where obligations are not met”. “Lobbying is an essential part of the democratic process. It plays an important role in policy formation. It is essential, however, that this activity is transparent and open to public scrutiny. The public need to be able to monitor the potential influence that interest groups and representative bodies have on public policy issues and decisions.” “Essentially it must be clear who is lobbying whom, about what and why. This transparency is a key driver of trust in government. The Lobbying Register has, from its introduction, proved to be an outstanding example of best practice in using this driver to greatest advantage.”",0,1
2024/5/6,"Taoiseach and Spanish PM reaffirm their wish to formally recognise Palestine Simon Harris says international community clear that Israeli military operation in Rafah will inevitably lead to ‘disastrous humanitarian consequences’ Taoiseach Simon Harris has spoken by telephone on Monday to Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez about the recognition of Palestine. Ireland and Spain are leading an effort to get several EU countries to recognise the State of Palestine in the coming weeks, as part of a drive to support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. In a statement issued by Government Buildings, Mr Harris said he and Mr Sánchez had “reaffirmed the wish for both Spain and Ireland to recognise Palestine, agreeing that formal recognition is an important part of acknowledging that a two-state solution is the only way to bring about peace and stability in the region, with a State of Palestine and the State of Israel living side-by-side in peace and security”. “Prime Minister Sánchez and I are both eager to make progress on this very shortly and we agreed to remain in close contact,” he added. “We are co-ordinating efforts with other European states to recognise a Palestinian state alongside like-minded countries. This will be done in a way that can have the most positive impact on the situation on the ground.” Mr Harris also said the two men “took stock of the work under way in New York on a resolution on Palestine’s membership of the UN”. “Ireland fully supports Palestinian membership of the UN. The UN General Assembly will consider this issue on May 10th and we expect a large majority of UN member to take a similar position,” he said. The conversation took place as Israel ordered civilians in parts of Rafah to evacuate to a “humanitarian zone” 20km away in what may be a preparation for an anticipated military assault on the city, the last holdout of Hamas but also where more than a million refugees from the invasion of Gaza have been sheltering. “Prime Minister Sánchez and I shared our deep concern about reports that Israel has ordered an evacuation of civilians from parts of Rafah in preparation of a military operation,” Mr Harris said. “I reiterate my call on Israel not to undertake a full-scale military operation in Rafah. The international community has made it very clear that an Israeli military operation in Rafah will inevitably lead to disastrous humanitarian consequences and the deaths of large numbers of innocent civilians. The protection of civilians is an obligation under international humanitarian law.” The Taoiseach reiterated the call for an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional and immediate release of all remaining hostages and for “a surge in humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza”.",0,1
2024/5/7,"Use of electric collars on cats and dogs to be banned under new regulations Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue says move follows months of ‘significant consultation’ Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue is to introduce regulations in the coming months to ban the use of electric collars on dogs and cats. The move follows months of “significant consultation” on the issue, he told RTÉ radio’s Today Show. The regulations will not have an impact on electric fences as animals can avoid them. The target is electric shock collars which can be used on dogs and cats to control their behaviour, and in some circumstances can be used for training. However, people who already have remote controlled electric collars on their animals will not be required to remove them. The plan is to phase out use of such control methods, the Minister said, adding that it was a proportionate response. Mr McConalogue said that he did not anticipate a rush to purchase such items before they are banned. They were not broadly used, but it was a significant issue from a welfare point of view and the new regulations were necessary to ensure that people “provide appropriate respect and care” for their pets. The move had been prompted in an effort to ensure that Ireland’s laws and policies were appropriate to protect animals and was an issue that was constantly monitored and adjusted as necessary as new evidence emerged. The new regulations had been advised by the Advisory Council on Companion Animal Welfare which had been set up to bring together all the key stakeholders and organisations, he said. According to the Department of Agriculture, the proposed regulation will ban the use of electronic shock collars operated by a hand-held remote control on dogs and cats. It will provide for those currently using these shock collars on their dogs to register with the department, provide the dog’s microchip ID and dog licence number, and continue to use the collars for the lifetime of that dog. This registration process is to be completed by three months from the date of introduction of the regulation. The use of these shock collars on deaf dogs will be exempt from the new legislation.",0,1
2024/5/7,"Taoiseach insists asylum seekers camping by Grand Canal not another Mount Street situation Simon Harris says multiagency approach needed to deal with accommodation challenges Taoiseach Simon Harris has insisted that the appearance of almost 80 tents used by asylum seekers along the banks of the Grand Canal near Baggot Street is not another Mount Street encampment. A week after the authorities removed tents from the streets surrounding the International Protection Accommodation Service (Ipas) office in Mount Street – and offered alternative accommodation to 290 people – some 76 tents were evident on the stretch of canal between Mount Street and Baggot Street on Tuesday. Tents were also erected on ground close to the Salesforce offices near the Docks. Mr Harris said that the Government would find new accommodation for arriving asylum seekers and would not allow the same situation as Mount Street arise. “What we saw happen in relation to Mount Street was untruly unacceptable. It was getting very near a public health emergency in terms of the wellbeing of very vulnerable people.” He continued: “Let me be very clear, what is happening in other parts of the city isn’t [comparable]. What happened in Mount Street was it was allowed to go on for weeks and weeks, months. “That would not be the situation in relation to the Grand Canal. From time to time, situations will emerge because it’s a very difficult and challenging accommodation situation. But we won’t stand for a situation [like] Mount Street.” Mr Harris was speaking outside Government Buildings. He said that a multiagency response was required “where we don’t have some sort of national game to ‘pass the parcel’ when responding to a very significant humanitarian situation. “It wasn’t enough in my view that there was a silo, that it was somebody else’s responsibility.” He said he was confident that progress would be made in finding accommodation for those currently camping. He said the conversation about migration needed to be larger than that around accommodation supply. Faced with the prospect of more than 20,000 applicants for international protection in 2024, he said the Government needed to look at the issue from all perspectives: processing time; deportations; giving people a quicker answer. . “It has to be that balanced firm approach.” The Cabinet approved the Taoiseach’s own memo for a Dublin taskforce. The initiative is a response to the Dublin riots last November and aims to rejuvenate the city centre, improve the public realm, ensure the city centre is a safe environment and endeavour to make it a “more desirable place to live”. The Cabinet also heard that the annual report of An Comisinéir Teanga disclosed he dealt with 634 complaints in 2023 in relation to an absence of, or poor, public services through the medium of Irish. A substantial number of complaints related to a síneadh fada used incorrectly in a person’s name or surname.",0,1
2024/5/8,"Ireland moving forward with plans to recognise Palestinian state in coming weeks, says Tánaiste Irish officials expect vote on full Palestinian UN membership at General Assembly to be carried by significant margin, says Micheál Martin Ireland is moving forward with plans to recognise Palestinian statehood in the coming weeks and will vote in favour of its membership of the United Nations on Friday, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said. Mr Martin told Green Party TDs and Senators on Wednesday evening that the UN General Assembly will consider Palestinian membership of the body this Friday with Ireland due to vote in favour. Irish officials expect this vote to be carried by a significant margin, Mr Martin said, and while Government sources said a large margin in favour would send a strong message. The Tánaiste is also understood to have outlined how the Government is working with like-minded countries such as Spain in order to be in a position to recognise a Palestinian state in the coming weeks. Sources in Dublin indicated no firm date had been agreed with other European countries for a planned move to recognise Palestinian statehood, but agreed that May 21st was a possibility following reports that it was being considered. A spokesman for the Taoiseach, Simon Harris, said that “Ireland and Spain’s work continues together on recognising the State of Palestine” in the wake of his call with Pedro Sanchez, the prime minister of Spain, earlier this week. “The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Sanchez reaffirmed the wish for both Spain and Ireland to recognise Palestine, agreeing that formal recognition is an important part of acknowledging that a two-state solution is the only way to bring about peace and stability in the region, with a State of Palestine and the State of Israel living side-by-side in peace and security.” A spokesman for the Tánaiste said that discussions on recognition were ongoing with a number of like-minded European countries. “Ireland’s focus will continue to be on ensuring a decision on recognition has a positive impact on the prospects for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, based on a two-state solution, and supports progress towards comprehensive regional peace, based on the principles of the Arab Peace Plan,” he said. Mr Martin’s briefing for the Greens’ parliamentary party on Wednesday ruffled some feathers in Fianna Fáil due to his decision not to hold weekly meetings of his own TDs and Senators. In the meeting, he is understood to have spoken of his frustration at the heavy-handed restrictions Israel is putting on humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying Ireland is putting pressure at international levels on this issue. Elsewhere, at the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, Taoiseach Simon Harris promised that action would be taken “very soon” to resolve the numerous tents pitched alongside the Grand Canal in Dublin. The Fine Gael leader said as issues arise, like what has happened alongside the city canal in recent days, they will be dealt with. The meeting also discussed the RTÉ reports published this week, Mr Harris’s plan for a Dublin city taskforce and personal security of Oireachtas members.",0,1
2024/5/9,"Asylum seekers in tents in the Grand Canal area to be moved Significant concern in Government over ‘record levels’ of new arrivals as State struggles to find extra space The Government will move as early as Thursday morning to begin relocating asylum seekers from tents in the Grand Canal area. There is a push by senior officials to significantly increase the level of tented accommodation offered at sites such as Crooksling in southwest Dublin, with Taoiseach Simon Harris promising action “very soon” on Wednesday evening. Mr Harris later told the Fine Gael parliamentary party that as issues arise, such as what has happened alongside the city canal in recent days, “they will be dealt with.” There is significant concern at the highest levels of Government, however, about what one source described on Wednesday night as “record levels” of new arrivals as the State is struggling to find extra space. The number of tents along the Grand Canal, near Mount Street Lower where the headquarters of the International Protection Office (IPO) is located, continued to increase on Wednesday, with more than 100 tents present. A significant number of those sleeping there were from Palestine, as well as Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan. None of those who spoke to The Irish Times were aware of a planned clearance. However, more than 100 male asylum seekers were told they would be transferred from Citywest and Crooksling, in Dublin, in recent days an apparent move to free up space for others in tents along the Grand Canal. About 60 men were preparing to leave Crooksling on Wednesday morning. It is unclear if all 60 were transferred. About 35 were moved to Newtownmountkennedy in Co Wicklow, a location of recent anti-asylum seeker protests. A further 50 are expected to leave Citywest on Thursday. Notices posted at the sites said transfers would take place from 10am. Men in neither location were told where they would be moved to. Government sources said that while processing times for asylum applications are “showing improvement” this is being matched with incoming applications which are “the highest on record”. They said that last week there were more than 610 new arrivals, including families with children – a number that would normally arrive here over a two-month period. The existing short-term plan will remain in place, with the State providing sites where people can be accommodated in tents. An expression of interest for office blocks and units needing refurbishment has gone out. Officials continue to work on plans to add up to eight extra countries to the list of countries of safe origin. It comes as a Government-appointed advisory group has raised “questions and concerns” about the State’s new refugee accommodation strategy. While welcoming parts of the plan, the Expert Advisory Group (EAG) on Ending Direct Provision, chaired by former senior civil servant Catherine Day, flags issues with the plan in a letter to Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman released under Freedom of Information laws. The group urged a time limit for the phasing out of “quick fix” accommodation in the private sector which may be unavoidable in the short term but does not meet the relevant standards. The group wrote: “The need to be realistic about what can be achieved in a short timescale should not overrule the principles set out in the White Paper [on ending direct provision].” The EAG also wants an expanded mandate for the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) to inspect all accommodation for international protection applicants and for the results to be made public. Ms Day and her colleagues said the State’s plan to buy buildings, convert empty office blocks and use modular homes “risks taking a long time to deliver”. It also wants criteria to ensure a “fair and evidence-based geographic distribution is seen to be operating and does not remain at the aspirational level”, adding that there needs to be a “greater sense of urgency” around communications.",0,1
2024/6/10,"Limerick mayor election: Independent John Moran over 5,000 votes clear after first count Independent candidate and former Department of Finance secretary general still short of quota John Moran, the former Department of Finance secretary general, has topped the poll in the Limerick mayoral election. The Independent candidate polled 18,308 votes, some 5,000 more than his nearest challenger, Helen O’Donnell, another independent candidate. However, with the quota set at 39,873 and 15 contenders in the race, Mr Moran is a long way from being elected and the count is a long way from concluding. Fianna Fáil’s Dee Ryan (11,785) and Fine Gael’s Daniel Butler (10,190) were third and fourth respectively after the first count. Limerick voted in favour of having a directly-elected mayor in a 2019 plebiscite. The mayor will be paid €154,000 per year. Their most significant power will be proposing the annual budget for Limerick City and County Council, though this will need the approval of councillors. A cross-party tally of votes on Sunday, which put Mr Moran on 24 per cent and Ms O’Donnell on 16 per cent, have proven to be relatively accurate. Elsewhere in the field, Sinn Féin TD Maurice Quinlivan polled 8,331 votes with Independent candidate Frankie Daly receiving 4,574. Ahead of the count, Mr Moran said he was not commenting on the tally figures. Ms O’Donnell, who was endorsed by local businessman JP McManus, said: “I would hope to get transfers, but it’s too early to say, but it will definitely go down to transfers.” Ms O’Donnell, whose late husband Tom was a Fine Gael TD and MEP, was herself a member of the party until just before she entered the election race as an Independent. Mr Butler retained his council seat in Limerick City West. Other mayoral candidates to keep their council seats were Independent Frankie Daly, Conor Sheehan of the Labour Party and Elisa O’Donovan of the Social Democrats.",0,1
2024/6/10,"Robert Troy tells SIPO hearing that his errors in registering interests were ‘in no way intentional’ Former minister of state claimed any directorships and properties he ever had were registered at one point Robert Troy TD, the former minister of state, has insisted his business and property interests were “an open book” and he had “nothing to hide”. While he made mistakes in completing documents registering those interests, every property and position he ever held was registered, often over multiple years, he said. Giving evidence during an open hearing of a Standards in Public Office (Sipo) commission investigation into allegations against him, Mr Troy said he accepted he made errors in the manner he completed his register of interests as a Dáil deputy. He insisted, however, these included registering properties solely under the “occupation” section of his returns rather than for a second time on each return under the “land” section. Other mistakes included failing to register directorships, or companies related to his properties, and stakes in some of those properties in end of year returns. He said he mistakenly believed once a property had been sold, or a directorship exited, in a particular year, they did not need to be declared in a return for the end of that year. He now accepted he was mistaken in this belief, which had resulted in him making the same error repeatedly in his returns. But he also said his ownership, or part ownership, of all of his 11 properties, and his directorships, were registered in the previous years. The SIPO statutory investigation into allegations Mr Troy breached ethics legislation is looking into his alleged failure to declare all his property ownership in his annual declarations setting out his interests, many of which he concedes, but insists were by error rather than any effort to conceal. The SIPO commission will not solely consider whether errors, or breaches of legislation, took place but also if they were inadvertent, negligent, reckless or intentional and whether they were serious or minor in nature. Mr Troy’s legal team said he had made a supplementary declaration of interest, amending his errors, in 2022. In doing so he had availed of a mechanism open to anyone legally obliged to declare their interests. His defence also told the commission the errors made were “minor” and “inadvertent” in nature “certainly not intentional, certainly not reckless”. Mr Troy told Hugh McDowell BL, representing the commission at the hearing, that he had completed all the returns himself but was now “sorry” he had not “sought professional advice” when doing so. If he had sought out that advice “I wouldn’t be here today” and “perhaps” would not have missed out on being a junior minister, he said. Mr Troy, a Fianna Fáil TD for the Longford-Westmeath constituency, “hoped” his explanations at Monday’s hearings “demonstrate these errors were in no way intentional and at no point did I try to conceal any of my information or any of the interests I had in any property or any directorships”. He said when it was brought to his attention that his statement of members interests “may be inaccurate or there may be errors” he carried out a review of all such returns down the years since first elected to the Dáil. “It then became apparent to me that I had inadvertently excluded certain assets or certain interests under certain headings,” he told the hearing, adding he then made amendments. But he insisted he had “always acknowledged” the errors after they came to light – initially on The Ditch website – and “took full responsibility” for them, adding that was why he had resigned as a minister of state at the Department of Enterprise in 2022. The SIPO commission must now, as part of its investigation, consider the evidence heard on Monday, and the documents they have received in relation to the case and draw up a report.",0,1
2024/6/12,"Minister hits out at Mattie McGrath’s ‘anti-science world view’ as TD claims EPA issues ‘fake news’ Malcolm Noonan calls on Independent Tipperary TD to withdraw ‘absolutely disgraceful’ comments about Environmental Protection Agency A Minister has accused Independent TD Mattie McGrath of having an “anti-science world view”. Minister of State Malcolm Noonan also called on the Tipperary TD to withdraw comments he made about the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which the Minister described as an “absolute disgrace”. Mr Noonan made his remarks after Mr McGrath described the EPA as “a disgraceful, discredited organisation”. He said it “comes out with fake news all the time” as he referred to the publication on Wednesday of the agency’s annual report on water quality. The report found no overall improvement in the water quality of Ireland’s rivers, lakes, estuaries or groundwaters, and revealed that the biggest issue affecting water quality remains nutrient pollution from both agriculture and urban waste water. Water bodies in bad condition included stretches of the river Laune in Kerry; parts of the Annagh river in Clare; the Ahavarraga stream in Limerick; and the Nenagh river in Tipperary. However, Mr McGrath claimed the EPA was a “disgraceful, discredited organisation because they will not check municipal plants” as a cause of water pollution. He claimed Mr Noonan “knows this better than I do. I have put it to him before. The EPA is discredited, comes out with fake news all the time, and they’re demonising farmers and blaming farmers for being the baddies. Of course, farmers are mentioned in this morning’s report as well, included with the municipal plants, but they had to say that. The facts speak for themselves. The records are there.” But the Minister hit out at Mr McGrath, and said his “anti-science world view really is not welcome in this chamber”. The Green Party Minister called on Mr MrGrath to withdraw his remarks, and said his anti-science view is one “we’re seeing emerge right across Europe in the European election, and we’re seeing it here in Ireland as well. It really is most unwelcome that he made such a comment here in the Dáil Chamber.” The Minister and TD were speaking during a private member’s motion from the Regional group of Independents on the Nature Restoration Law. It is an European Commission proposal to restore the ecosystems of at least 20 per cent of the EU’s land and sea areas by 2030 and all ecosystems by 2050 through the revival of forests, wetlands and other areas damaged by human development. Independent TD Denis Naughten, who introduced the debate, said the law was essential in the fight against biodiversity loss and climate change. He said the law includes provisions for flexibility and support for farmers who rewet their lands and contribute to climate mitigation. But he warned the law’s implementation “could significantly impact on our farmers who play a crucial role in maintaining our rural landscapes and the economies of many of our towns and villages”. “To address these concerns we propose the development of a national restoration plan that balances climate action with the protection of farmers’ livelihoods” and “would ensure that any actions on farmland are voluntary and designed to allow agricultural activities to continue”. The Government did not oppose the motion.",0,1
2024/6/15,"Peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow must respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity, says Taoiseach Russia and China not in attendance at peace conference talks involving more than 100 state and institutional representatives taking place amid high security at Swiss mountaintop resort Taoiseach Simon Harris has warned that any peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow that does not respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity would be a “devastating development” for the postwar order. He is pressing the issue of Ukrainian child abductions at the Bürgenstock summit near Lucerne in Switzerland. Over 100 governments and international organisations have gathered at a mountain resort until Sunday to map out future steps towards a peace agreement. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told more than 100 state and institutional representatives “everyone here today is for the same, just peace”. “Our nations are stronger than any aggressor,” he said. “The very idea of international law remains alive and your presence here proves that the UN charter and basic conventions are not a formality but real conditions of coexistence.” Russia has avoided the gathering and, on its eve, President Vladimir Putin proposed a peace deal which would involve Ukraine ceding territory now controlled by Russian troops. “I don’t think Putin is in any position to be setting preconditions,” said Mr Harris, insisting any peace process and final settlement would have to respect territorial integrity of Ukraine. “If we in Europe are even to consider anything that is counter to this, that would be a devastating development. It is not plausible from an Irish, an EU and a global perspective.” The Taoiseach called the gathering, the largest since the war began in February 2022, an “important moment to begin the process of mapping out what peace may look like”. Main talks are focusing on issues of nuclear safety, food security and humanitarian concerns. Ireland already assists Ukraine on demining and cybersecurity and is providing electricity generators. Mr Harris is participating in a breakout group looking at the issue of an estimated 20,000 children abducted from their families and removed from Ukraine since the war began. “This is not just something that is illegal, it is morally repugnant,” said Mr Harris, promising to push for increased pressure Russia on this issue – directly and through intermediaries. China, a key intermediary with Russia, stayed away from a gathering it views as a talking shop. Mr Harris said he regretted the absence, saying China “has every right to express any view it wishes”, but that he hoped other countries would come on board in future. “Talking is important and, in democratic countries, that is what we do,” he said. “We talk lots, we engage and try to bring together a consensus.” With Russia and China absent, attention in the opening session focused on Saudi Arabia, seen as an intermediary with Moscow and a potential host country for a second-step conference. Foreign minister Faisal bin al Saud expressed hope the Swiss gathering would lead to a “political track” of “fair dialogue between all parties”. “Any credible process will require Russian participation and we hope the outcome of the summit reflects those aims,” he said. Opening the conference, hosted by Switzerland at Ukraine’s request, Swiss federal president Viola Amherd said “we are all aware that a peace process without Russia is inconceivable, a lasting solution must involve all parties”. “As the international community we can help pave the way there, that is why we are here,” she said. In advance of the gathering US vice-president Kamala Harris pledged a €1.4 billion package to help repair energy generation infrastructure damaged by Russian bombardments. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told delegates that Russia’s attack was a violation of the UN charter and a “cautionary tale for the entire world”. “Our common task is to reaffirm the primacy of the United Nations charter,” she said. Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Russia’s proposals on the eve of the gathering, saying a “ceasefire based on new realities would only legitimise an illegal land grab”. “It would result in another frozen conflict that is unjust, dangerous and not sustainable for Ukraine, Europe or the international community as a whole,” he said.",0,1
2024/6/15,"Taoiseach rules out early general election despite push within Government parties for October vote Harris said the electorate had not voted for change in recent local and European elections and wanted him to ‘get stuck in and do the job’ Taoiseach Simon Harris has ruled out an early general election, saying people had not voted for change in the recent local and European elections and instead expected him, as a new Taoiseach, to “get stuck in and do the job”. “Many pundits and commentators probably expected my party and other Government parties to have very bad local and European elections, they probably expected Sinn Féin to be on the ascendancy and then probably expected this weekend to ask me the question of why I would not have an election now, and surely the Government has lost its mandate,” he said. “The people of Ireland voted and they didn’t vote overwhelmingly for change. In fact, my party got more first preference votes in the local elections than any other party.” “The message I got when I went around the country ... is: ‘you’re a new Taoiseach, roll up your sleeves and get stuck in and do the job’. That is what I intend to do, that is why I was back at my desk at the crack of dawn the Monday after the election and my view on the timing of the election hasn’t changed.” When asked if delaying the election would give Sinn Féin time to regroup from their disappointing result in both June 7th polls, the Taoiseach instead said that it would “give myself a little bit of time to keep delivering for people. This is all about delivery for the Irish people. It may be an old-fashioned view from a relatively young politician but I believe if you work hard and deliver for people they might then vote for you. That is the approach I intend to take to this”. Mr Harris’s remarks, made on Saturday afternoon as he arrived in Switzerland to attend a Ukraine peace conference, are in contrast to growing calls within Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for a general election before Christmas. It is understood that there is a push within both parties to see a general election take place in October. Former Fine Gael minister for justice Charlie Flanagan has predicted there will be an autumn election. The Laois-Offaly TD said the “mood has lifted” in Fine Gael and the election result “was a clear endorsement of the centre parties”. However, the Taoiseach, Tánaiste Micheál Martin and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan have all maintained that the intention is for the Government run its full term into next year.",0,1
2024/6/15,"General election could take place in October as calls grow within Coalition October 18th or 25th mooted as TDs from main parties seek to capitalise on the outcome of the local and European elections There are growing calls within Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for a general election in October given the better-than-expected local and European election results for both parties and Sinn Féin’s lacklustre performance. There is a push within Fine Gael to have the general election between October 18th and October 25th, as TDs seek to capitalise on the outcome of the local and European elections. Sources in Fianna Fáil also suggested the election should take place before the end of October, pointing out that the clocks will not yet have changed, allowing for brighter evenings for canvassing. On Friday, former Fine Gael minister for justice Charlie Flanagan predicted there would be an autumn election. The Laois-Offaly TD said the “mood has lifted” in Fine Gael and the election result “was a clear endorsement of the centre parties”. He said: “It is clear that both parties [Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil] will be reducing their August holidays ... with a view to an autumn election.” A sitting Fine Gael Minister said the election should happen “sooner rather than later” and said: “Things will move quickly in terms of ensuring we’re the best-prepared party.” With the local and European elections over, the process of selecting Dáil candidates will ramp up in the coming weeks regardless of whether the election takes place in the autumn or next spring. The results of the European elections, with four sitting TDs elected as MEPs, mean that byelections will have to take place in Dublin Bay North, Laois-Offaly, Carlow-Kilkenny and Clare unless a general election is called first. There is the possibility of a fifth byelection if a sitting TD is nominated to become Ireland’s next European commissioner, with much speculation that Minister for Finance Michael McGrath could be selected for the role. The Government has a six-month window in which to call byelections from July 16th, when MEPs take up their European Parliament seats. This means Coalition leaders would have until mid-January before they must make a decision on whether to hold the byelections or go to the country. A Fianna Fáil Minister said “all bets are off” after the budget, which is due to be published in October. “I can’t see the purpose of holding the byelections ... we should have the election before the time changes,” the Minister said, adding that October 25th would be “a good date”. Byelections would be “costly and nonsensical and annoying”, a Fine Gael source said. “We are clearly within election time and autumn reduces uncertainty.” However, there was not universal agreement among those who spoke to The Irish Times on holding the general election before the end of the year, with one Fianna Fáil Minister saying: “If you’re elected for five years you should do the five years.” A different source highlighted the potential pluses to Coalition parties of running for the full term. These include budget measures such as tax cuts or welfare increases kicking in before polling day and more homes being built as the Coalition seeks to show progress in tackling the housing crisis. Taoiseach Simon Harris, Tánaiste Micheál Martin and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan have all maintained that the intention is for the Government run its full term into next year. Both Mr Harris and Mr Martin reaffirmed this position in Castlebar as the Midlands-North-West European election count came to a close, with Independents Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan and Ciarán Mullooly; Fine Gael’s Nina Carberry and Maria Walsh; and Barry Cowen of Fianna Fáil taking the five seats. Mr Harris said he did not fear byelections, adding that his view “on the timing of the general election hasn’t changed”.",0,1
2024/6/17,"Civil Service to get up to 60,000 ‘previously used’ laptops to boost recycling Office of Government Procurement scheme worth €30m permits purchase of ‘remanufactured’ laptops to cut costs and carbon emissions As many as 60,000 “remanufactured” previously used laptops will be sourced for civil servants over the next four years under a €30 million spending plan. The environmental initiative by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) will allow public bodies to buy laptops under a purchasing framework designed to cut costs and carbon emmissions. The Government said the overhauled used laptops are “subject to rigorous manufacturing and testing standards, and devices supplied under the new framework come with up to three years of warranty”. It pointed to a scientific study by Cranfield University which found “significant environmental benefits to choosing remanufactured devices over newly manufactured devices”. The benefits include the prevention of approximately 316kg of CO2 emissions per laptop and the saving of 190,000 litres of water in the manufacturing process. In addition, approximately 1,200kg of Earth’s resources are not required to be mined, refined or consumed. The cost of the laptops is, on average, 30 per cent lower than the newly manufactured equivalent, according to the Government. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said the initiative supported the Government’s ambitions “to transition to a low-carbon society”. “This is the first such framework to be established by a central purchasing body in the EU and offers significant environmental benefits, including carbon reduction and resource and water savings as well as value for money.” Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement Ossian Smyth said: “The public sector now has a way to buy remanufactured laptops from a trusted source, saving money and avoiding waste. “This is a change from previous rules that advised always to buy new products. I’m delighted to see this progress.” The plans are part of Government’s efforts to encourage the “circular economy” which is aimed at reducing waste. The Government said the contract has an estimated value of up to €30 million and it “fully supports the circular economy objectives set out in the Green Public Procurement Strategy and Action Plan 2024-2027.” In the region of 60,000 laptops can be procured up to the €30 million value of the framework over its four-year term. This equates to a reduction of 19 million kilograms of CO2, 72 million kilograms of mined resource preservation and 11 billion litres of water not used, the Government statement said. The contract allows for varied configurations and specifications for the laptops, depending on the requirement of the purchaser.",0,1
2024/6/17,"Meeting on backing von der Leyen for second term as commission president breaks up without agreement  Government will put forward candidate for EU commissioner role in ‘next few weeks’ Negotiations among EU leaders around whether to back Ursula von der Leyen for a second term as European Commission president ended without agreement, after several hours of talks on Monday night. However, it is understood a plan to nominate Ms von der Leyen for another five years in the powerful role of commission president is still on course to be approved at another summit of leaders late next week. Charles Michel, current president of the European Council, said the meeting of the national leaders of the 27 EU countries in Brussels on Monday had not been expected to make a formal decision. Speaking after midnight, Mr Michel said the national leaders had a “good discussion” over dinner on Monday evening. “It goes in the right direction I think but there’s no agreement tonight at this stage,” he told reporters. Mr Michel said he fully expected a decision would be taken on who the leaders would pick for the commission presidency at the summit starting next Thursday. “I think it is our collective duty to make a decision by the end of June,” he said.  Talks on Monday evening saw an “in-depth exchange of views” between leaders, he said. “The purpose today, tonight was not to make a decision … It will be clarified next week,” he said. It is understood the leaders discussed the broad outlines of a plan to nominate Ms von der Leyen for a second term as commission president, which is expected to be formally signed off next week, barring any late developments in the meantime. Under the plan the current Estonia prime minister Kaja Kallas would become the next EU’s foreign affairs chief, and the former prime minister of Portugal Antonio Costa would take over as the next president of the European Council. Leaders were due to discuss the allocation of several senior EU roles over dinner, which started at about 8pm. The top EU jobs are traditionally divvied up between politicians from the main political groupings, which are the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and centrists Renew. Negotiators representing the main groupings had been involved in discussions for a number of hours before the leaders sat down to talk over dinner on Monday, while other national leaders held talks in smaller huddles. In a post after the meeting ended on X, formerly Twitter, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban said the EPP had “teamed up” with the liberal and centre left groupings, to divide “the top jobs of the EU among themselves”. “We will unite the forces of the European right and fight against pro-migration and pro-war bureaucrats,” he said. Speaking earlier on his way into the summit, Taoiseach Simon Harris said there was an consensus emerging to support Ms von der Leyen for another term as commission president. Ms von der Leyen is expected to secure the support of national leaders, following which her nomination for a second term would need to be approved by a majority of MEPs in a European Parliament vote. The Irish Government is expected to support her, though several Irish MEPs, including all the Fianna Fáil MEPs, have said they will not vote for her. There is an “emerging consensus” among EU leaders to back Ursula von der Leyen for a second term as European Commission president, T Mr Harris has said.",0,1
2024/6/17,"Harris and Biden discuss humanitarian crisis in Gaza and need for ‘immediate ceasefire’ Taoiseach and US president also reaffirmed commitment to Ukraine and discussed power-sharing in Northern Ireland The Taoiseach Simon Harris has spoken by telephone with the US President Joe Biden this evening, officials have confirmed. It was the first conversation between the two men since Mr Harris became Taoiseach. According to a readout of the call provided by Irish officials, they discussed powersharing in Northern Ireland, the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and the ongoing work of the US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland for Economic Affairs, Joe Kennedy. They also discussed the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire and for all hostages to be released and for aid to flow freely. The Taoiseach also gave President Biden his account of the Ukraine Peace Summit held in Switzerland over the weekend, which he attended and where he also had discussions with US Vice President Kamala Harris. President Biden told the Taoiseach the United States would continue to support Ukraine and the world must stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes, officials said. The Taoiseach and President Biden discussed the deep and growing economic ties between Ireland and the United States and Simon Harris also thanked the President for his enduring friendship to Ireland, a spokesman for Government Buildings said.",0,1
2024/6/18,"Dublin Zoo says claims raised by TD about shooting of zebra ‘completely false’ Striker, a 26 year old male zebra, was euthanised ‘humanely’, zoo says, after Paul Murphy claims involvement of unlicensed staff member Dublin Zoo has described as “completely false” claims that a zebra was shot dead at Dublin Zoo with a gun used by an unlicensed member of staff. People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy raised the allegations in the Dáil on Tuesday, saying he understood the incident happened last week and the animal was “euthanised with a gun, as opposed to with an injection which is the appropriate and normal thing that happens in zoos around the world. This was not done by a vet and a vet is the only person licensed to do so”. Mr Murphy said it was “not the case that the zebra was running around endangering people”. The Dublin South-West TD said “there is a serious question about this event and there are other serious questions about the zoo”. However, in a statement to The Irish Times on Tuesday evening, Dublin Zoo said this was not the case, and that it had made a decision to “humanely euthanise” Striker, a 26 year old male zebra. “This decision followed careful consideration and adherence to best practices and recommended protocols for animal welfare in zoo management. The procedure was carried out with utmost compassion, using the most appropriate method to ensure Striker’s immediate and humane dispatch,” the statement said. “The process was conducted safely, resulting in Striker passing away in the most humane manner possible.” Accusations that the procedure was carried by an unlicensed member of staff were “completely false”, the zoo said, adding: “Any insinuations to the contrary are entirely incorrect and baseless.” Speaking in the Dáil, Mr Murphy called for a new and independent investigation at Dublin Zoo following the allegations, pointed to a previous investigation following protected disclosures and allegations made in the Dáil and Seanad. The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) which carried out the inquiry found in 2022 that the majority of the 23 allegations about the zoo were unfounded. There was some evidence found to support three “historical” allegations but the zoo had resolved the case and made changes. Taoiseach Simon Harris said he was not aware of the situation which he described as a “very serious matter”. He told Mr Murphy he would seek a report from the relevant Government department and pointed out that “Dublin Zoo is independently run but receives funding from the State”.",0,1
2024/6/18,"European leaders set to back Ursula von der Leyen for second term Minister for Finance Michael McGrath tipped for nomination as Ireland’s EU commissioner  European leaders are set to back Ursula von der Leyen for a second term as the head of the European Commission, following a push to settle on their pick for the powerful position quickly. Taoiseach Simon Harris said there was a “consensus” emerging among national leaders of the 27 EU countries to get behind Ms von der Leyen for another five years as president of the commission. Leaders met in Brussels on Monday evening to kick off negotiations over who will be put forward for several high-profile roles at the top of the EU. Ms von der Leyen is expected to secure the support of national leaders, following which her nomination for a second term would need to be approved by a majority of MEPs in a European Parliament vote. The Irish Government is expected to support her, though several Irish MEPs, including all the Fianna Fáil MEPs, have said they will not vote for her. There has been a concerted push following the recent European elections to settle the question of who will be the next commission president sooner rather than later. “I don’t think there will be any gratitude from Irish citizens or European citizens if politicians here in Brussels are talking for weeks on end about who is going to do what,” Mr Harris said on his way into the meeting. A formal vote among the leaders to back Ms von der Leyen as their pick for commission president will likely only take place at a full two-day summit later next week. Meanwhile, the Government is expected to make a decision on who it plans to nominate as Ireland’s next EU commissioner shortly, possibly as early as the coming days. While Government Buildings remains tight-lipped, most speculation within Government circles is focused on Minister for Finance Michael McGrath as the likely nominee. The nomination of someone with such a senior political rank would increase the chances of a substantial portfolio, it is believed. Senior sources say there is some urgency in proceeding with the nomination as horse-trading over jobs is already well under way in Brussels. In accordance with an agreement struck between the party leaders at the beginning of the Coalition’s term in 2020, the appointment will be Fianna Fáil’s to make. Mr McGrath’s name is the one most frequently mentioned around Government as the likely nominee. Assuming Mr McGrath leaves Government immediately, it would mean that a vacancy arises for a new minister for finance just weeks before the summer economic statement – which sets out the budget parameters – and less than four months before the budget itself, the last before the general election. With Government finances in a strong position, Ministers and backbenchers expect a large giveaway budget to set them up for the election campaign, though Mr McGrath – and his Fine Gael colleague, Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe – have repeatedly warned of the need to temper expectations of a pre-election spending splurge. As well as discussing who EU leaders will choose as their pick for commission president, talks were also under way on Monday evening to divvy up who will be tapped to take over as the next EU foreign policy envoy and president of the European Council.",0,1
2024/6/18,"Speculation for European Commissioner job centres on Michael McGrath When asked, McGrath himself has parried the question, confirming only that he would ‘give it serious consideration’ “We need to get it done.” That is the view of people inside Government about the impending nomination of Ireland’s next European Commissioner, which some senior figures expect to happen within the next week. It is a nervous few days for the contenders for what is regarded as one of the top posts any Irish politician can aspire to. In the wake of the European election results last week, EU leaders were meeting in Brussels on Monday and were expected to agree on a series of senior appointments. Nothing is yet finally settled and many of the appointments have to be approved by the European Parliament – which is not a foregone conclusion. But the widespread expectation in Brussels is that Ursula von der Leyen will get another term as the President of the European Commission, while the job of President of the European Council – chairman of the EU’s most powerful decision-making body, the council of all the heads of government – will go to the former Portuguese prime minister Antonio Costa, while the next EU foreign policy chief will be the Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas. Meanwhile, each member state government is also considering who they should nominate to serve in the next Commission. Each state gets one commissioner but there are a smaller number of impactful and important jobs, which countries will compete for. Hence the desire to get a nomination in early, in order to be able to lobby for one of the top jobs. “We’ve got to get in quick,” says one senior Irish source, based in Brussels. “Ideally for this meeting, but if not, certainly for next week.” EU leaders are due to meet again next week for a two-day summit at which the horse-trading over jobs will continue. The name on everyone’s lips around Government is that of Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath. True, some say Charlie McConalogue, currently Minister for Agriculture. A few people have floated the possibility of the former Attorney General Paul Gallagher, though senior sources brushed off the notion. One person mentioned Stephen Donnelly, the Minister for Health. But all the speculation points towards McGrath. What is certain is that it will be a Fianna Fáil nomination. That was agreed when the Programme for Government – and the associated agreements on jobs – was being settled between Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan back in 2020. There was a long-held, and perhaps not entirely ungrounded, perception in some quarters that Martin might take the job himself. But he has firmly dismissed that now, not least because he formed the judgment some months ago that he has a good shot at leading Fianna Fáil back into Government and becoming Taoiseach again after the next election. Last week’s results have certainly borne out his judgment. When asked, McGrath himself has parried the question, confirming only that he would “give it serious consideration”. Within Government it is expected he would accept an offer. The party has a ready-made successor in his Cork constituency in the shape of his brother Seamus, who topped the poll in the local elections. It would mean Martin has to find a new finance minister just weeks before the summer economic statement and a few months before an election budget due (currently at least) in early October. In those circumstances, there are two options – a replacement from within the Cabinet, or from outside it. Some insiders feel that a Cabinet reshuffle is messier than an outside appointment and have suggested that Dara Calleary or Jack Chambers could be promoted. Chambers’s star is especially high right now, having served as director of elections for the local election campaign. But it would be a big step up for either man.",0,1
2024/6/19,"Micheál Martin names Jack Chambers as Fianna Fáil’s deputy leader Party has not had a deputy leader since resignation of Dara Calleary in August 2020 The party has not had a deputy leader since the resignation of Dara Calleary in August 2020. The Tánaiste made the announcement outside Government Buildings in Dublin on Wednesday evening. The move will inevitably prompt speculation that Mr Martin is nominating Mr Chambers as his preferred successor whenever he decides to step down as party leader. Party sources played down that interpretation, however, pointing out that the party’s electoral college arrangements mean that candidates for the leadership have to campaign among the party membership, diminishing the influence of the previous leader. Nonetheless, Mr Chamber’s elevation to the role is indicative of how highly Mr Martin rates him. He was the director of elections for the party’s local election campaign, which saw it win the highest number of seats to retain its standing as the largest party of local Government. As chief whip when Fianna Fáil held the Taoiseach’s office, Mr Chambers worked closely with Mr Martin. Since then, Mr Chambers has remained at the Cabinet table in a super junior role at the Department of Transport. In the event of a vacancy in Cabinet – for example, if Michael McGrath were to be appointed European Commissioner next week, as many around Government expect – Mr Chambers would likely be in line for promotion. First elected to the Dáil in 2016 to the Dublin West seat once held by the late Brian Lenihan, Mr Chambers served as chief whip 2020-2022, and as a junior minister in the Department of Transport since then. He qualified in medicine from the Royal College of Surgeons, and also holds a degree in law and political science from Trinity College.",0,1
2024/6/2,"How did Ireland’s MEPs perform in Europe over the last five years? Coalition-building across political groups more important in European Parliament than in the Oireachtas Ten of Ireland’s 13 MEPs are running for another term in the European Parliament, but exactly how did they fare over the last five years and what did they achieve? Much of what you can achieve as an MEP depends on the political grouping you sit in. In the last term the parliamentary majority usually consisted of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), centrists Renew and centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D ). Fine Gael’s five MEPs sat with the EPP, Fianna Fáil’s pair are in Renew, the two Greens are in a Green grouping, with Chris MacManus, Luke “Ming” Flanagan, Clare Daly and Mick Wallace all in the Left group. Daly (Dublin) and Wallace (Ireland South) are among the most well-known Irish MEPs within the wider Brussels bubble, as well as the most controversial. Positions taken by Daly and Wallace in speeches have been seen as favourable to authoritarian regimes in Russia, China and Iran. In particular the pair have been criticised for taking stances seen as soft on Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Daly has also come under pressure over her advocacy for dissident republican prisoners. Speaking to The Irish Times, Daly said she and Wallace had been the subject of “smears” portraying them as supporters of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. She said her position was that peace negotiations should begin in Ukraine. This is something pro-Kyiv voices take to mean Ukraine conceding large swathes of ground taken by Russia in the conflict. Daly said she had consistently “condemned” the Russian invasion, but that the war was “unwinnable” for Ukraine. “It will absolutely end up in a negotiated settlement,” she said. While commentators frequently bash Wallace and Daly, their work rate is well regarded by fellow Irish MEPs, including those who vehemently disagree with their politics. Daly is seen as having been very prominently on the right side of the debate within the EU on Israel’s war in Gaza from the off. Sitting in the small Left grouping, the ability to shepherd legislation from a proposal into EU law is much more limited. As such they have used speeches in the parliament, later packaged into video clips for their large social media followings, to try to make their presence felt. By that yardstick they were among the most active of the Irish MEPs, with Wallace making 613 speeches in the parliament chamber and Daly 534. Third behind the pair was Fine Gael’s Seán Kelly (Ireland South) who is recorded as making 431 speeches, according to data collated by the website ParlTrack, which monitors EU lawmaking. However, speaking time is just one measure of what an MEP is up to, and most of the policymaking work happens outside of the parliament chamber. That can include taking the lead on legislation as what is known as a rapporteur, negotiating for changes to draft laws within political groupings, or with MEPs from rival groups. An MEP could spend up to two years as the lead rapporteur on a given law, going through rounds and rounds of talks and drafts trying to secure its passage. Ciarán Cuffe, the Green MEP from Dublin, is viewed by other MEPs as being effective during the last term. He was the lead negotiator on a new law around building energy performance. The law commits EU countries to renovate a portion of their housing stock that has the worst energy efficiency, while setting minimum energy standards for non-residential buildings. The law may not have got over the line without the help of Kelly, who has been in the European Parliament since 2009. As the EPP’s point person on the legislation, Kelly said he was “completely taken aback” by the opposition of many MEPs in his group. Despite securing several concessions he said a political decision had been taken by the EPP leadership to oppose climate legislation in the last year of the term. It was a “really hard battle” to try to convince centre-right MEPs to get behind the proposed law. “I was able to swing enough people in our group to get it passed,” he said. Fine Gael’s Frances Fitzgerald, who is not standing for re-election, is regarded as having had a strong five years, leading on a law to combat violence against women. Outgoing Fine Gael MEP Deirdre Clune was involved in the EU’s work on artificial intelligence, while the party’s MEP Colm Markey, who is also not contesting this election, is seen as someone who had a good grasp on policy details during his stint. One of the biggest pieces of legislation in the parliament’s term was the migration pact, a major overhaul of asylum policy that was years in the making. It will usher in a stricter approach to asylum seekers across the EU, with certain cases being fast-tracked and measures allowing countries to detain people in facilities at borders while their claim is processed. The pact was formally adopted in mid-May, with countries being given two years to enact the reforms. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil MEPs voted for the agreement, while Irish MEPs in the Left group and Grace O’Sullivan in the Greens voted against most of the measures. Another significant piece of legislation was the Digital Services Act, which gave the European Commission more powers to regulate big social media and online platforms. The new laws, which fully came into force this February, have seen the EU open investigations into Meta and TikTok over online safety concerns. If online platforms are found to have breached the new regulations, they can be hit with heavy fines of up to 6 per cent of their global turnover. Perhaps the most high-profile batch of policies of the last term was commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s “green deal” climate reforms to cut EU emissions in half by the end of the decade. One of its landmark policies, the Nature Restoration Law, still hangs in the balance despite being passed by the parliament. A compromise to water down the law, which committed the EU to restore 30 per cent of natural habitats deemed to be in poor condition by 2030, had been agreed by parliament and the council, which represents member states. However, Hungary later joined Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands to block the proposed legislation being formally signed off. Fianna Fáil’s Barry Andrews (Dublin) has largely concentrated on foreign affairs and international development during his time in parliament, while Billy Kelleher (Ireland South) is seen as having done good work on economic and agriculture policy. As somewhat of a celebrity candidate, Fine Gael’s Maria Walsh (Midlands-North-West) was at a disadvantage starting as an MEP without political experience. During her term, the 2014 Rose of Tralee winner focused on mental health and LGBT+ policy, but “didn’t set the world alight”, one parliamentary colleague said, echoing a sentiment expressed by several others familiar with the work of Ireland’s European parliamentarians. None of the Irish MEPs had as bizarre a first week in the job as Sinn Féin’s Chris MacManus, who started just as the gravity of the Covid-19 pandemic began to dawn on Europe. Previously a councillor on Sligo County Council, he was co-opted into the Midlands-North-West seat vacated when Matt Carthy was elected to the Dáil in February 2020. MacManus landed in Brussels on a Monday, signed into the parliament on a Tuesday, and on Wednesday all the MEPs were advised to travel home as countries started to weigh up lockdown measures. He spent his first six months as a parliamentarian working from a converted bedroom in Sligo, which he said “made the learning experience much more difficult”. The shift to remote working meant informal face-to-face conversations before or after meetings, or casual interactions such as socialising over a drink, were no longer happening. Those conversations on the sidelines are often crucial in building a rapport with other MEPs, which can later be the difference in corralling support or opposition for some amendment or law. MacManus had been working on an EU law around ensuring stronger rights for people to be able to pay with cash, which didn’t get over the line by the end of the term. Luke “Ming” Flanagan, an Independent MEP for Midlands-North-West, came into the parliament in 2014 as someone deeply sceptical about the EU. After two terms he said he had a much greater appreciation for the positive role the union could play. Distrust voters had of Brussels was often down to national politicians blaming the EU to cover their own backs on certain policies, Flanagan said. “My Euroscepticism came from what the Government was saying: ‘Europe made us do this on farming, made us do this on the environment’, when it was the fault of the Irish Government,” he said. A significant period of his term was overshadowed by a dispute involving a former member of his staff, Diarmuid Hayes, who left on bad terms. Hayes was later able to send a post from the politician’s Twitter account that gave the impression Flanagan had been searching for photos of former Green Party candidate Saoirse McHugh skinny-dipping. The post was sent late one night in September 2020, with Flanagan stating the following morning that he had been hacked. It was only when Hayes was charged over the incident in September 2023 and later apologised this February, that the Roscommon politician was fully vindicated. Despite being involved in Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) farmer subsidy reforms, Flanagan said he felt he had to keep his head down until the criminal process concluded. “I couldn’t open my mouth ... That was mind-bendingly frustrating,” he said. O’Sullivan, a Green MEP (Ireland South), said that as a single mother who is a carer for a daughter with special needs, the travel back and forth to the European Parliament took a significant toll. “When I was in the Seanad, I was able to manage as I would only be up and down the road to Dublin,” she said. During the term she pushed for EU legislation to govern soil quality, which will roll over into the next five-year mandate. O’Sullivan said the biggest learning curve had been the necessity of building coalitions to get things done, as the parliament was much more fluid than the Government-versus-Opposition nature of the Oireachtas. “If you’re out on the edges, the extremes on either side, you won’t get the people around you to make the kind of change that you need,” she said. “You can shout and scream in the plenary ... But I know what will happen to me, I will be isolated, I won’t be able to reach enough people.”",0,1
2024/6/20,"‘Simplistic’ to think non-Dublin candidate will help Greens, says O’Gorman as he lines up against Hackett Minister for Children has slight advantage as race begins to succeed Eamon Ryan  In the two-horse race to succeed Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, Roderic O’Gorman was ahead of Pippa Hackett, at least in terms of public endorsements from Ministers, TDs and councillors. O’Gorman had a just over three-to-one advantage as of Wednesday evening with 16 backers to Hackett’s five. This includes 12 councillors for O’Gorman, just over half of the party’s local government total of 23, compared to one for Hackett. There is an important caveat here. Unlike Fine Gael’s system for electing a leader – where parliamentary party members’ votes carry more weight than the grassroots – in the Green Party it is one member, one vote. So such endorsements are nice, but not necessarily game-changing. Nonetheless O’Gorman will surely be happier after day one of the campaign than Hackett. His camp will hope the endorsements will generate momentum as the contest plays out over the next three weeks. O’Gorman, a Dublin West TD has a high profile and busy brief as Minister for Children and Integration. Supporters highlight his history in the party and experience. Dublin city councillor Michael Pidgeon said: “When it seemed like the Green Party might disappear in 2011, he worked and worked to rebuild. He’s got principles, decency and experience.” Another city councillor, Janet Horner, said he had taken on “arguably the hardest job in Irish politics while keeping our values of equality, care, humanitarianism and climate action front and centre”. Offaly-based, Hackett can point to her four years at Cabinet as a “super-junior” agriculture minister. Her land use and biodiversity brief does not dominate the news agenda – for better or worse – in the same way as O’Gorman’s responsibilities. The Senator does have policy achievements under her belt such as more generous farm payments for afforestation and efforts to encourage organic farming. A farmer herself, perhaps Hackett’s key strength in the leadership contest is her perceived potential to build bridges with rural Ireland in a way that another Dublin-based leader might fail to do. This is something her supporters believe. Green Party chairwoman Pauline O’Reilly is supporting her in part because she is not from Dublin and it is essential there be a “rebalancing” of the party. Wicklow TD Steven Matthews said: “She is based outside Dublin, and she has the energy, the work ethic and the vision to make a fresh start for the Green Party.” O’Gorman has said it is “simplistic” to believe that having a non-Dublin leader will solve the party’s difficulties in rural Ireland. His solution is to listen to rural communities and the “strong rural voices” in the party and to strongly advocate for Green policies such as the local link public transport and alternative income streams for farmers. Hackett says the party’s policies “have to work for ordinary people” and be “easy” and “affordable” and she said that will be her focus as leader as she sought to build relationships “across communities, across Ireland”. The next Green leader will have to prepare for a looming general election that is all the more daunting given the poor results for the party in the local and European elections. The coming days will likely see more endorsements for both candidates. O’Gorman may have the edge in that department for now but there are hustings to come. Ultimately it is the Green Party’s more than 4,000 members that will decide who they want to lead the party into an uncertain future.",0,1
2024/6/20,"Green leader election: Former Dublin lord mayor latest to back Roderic O’Gorman Nominations for the leadership contest officially opened on Thursday morning Former Lord Mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu has become the latest Green Party councillor to endorse Minister for Children and Integration Roderic O’Gorman to be the party’s next leader. Her backing  means 13 of the party’s 23 councillors have now declared support for Mr Gorman in addition to four Oireachtas members. His rival for the role, Minister of State for Agriculture Pippa Hackett also has the support of four members of the Oireachtas with three councillors publicly declaring support. The Green Party operate a system of one member, one vote so ultimately the more than 4,000 members will make the decision on who should lead them. Nominations for the leadership contest officially opened this morning in the wake of Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan’s announcement earlier this week that he is leaving the role. In an interview with Midlands 103fm this morning, Offaly-based senator Ms Hackett said his departure provided the party with the chance of a “fresh start”. She said: “We do need that fresh start. I think everyone can see, the way the wind was blowing through the local election, certainly losing our two MEPs was a big blow to the party also. “But ultimately, if the Greens are to succeed as a political party and all the things we want to achieve for the country, to succeed, we need to bring the whole country on board. We need to bring everyone across rural Ireland, across the other cities. “And I think there’s probably been this Dublin centric focus, or that perceived Dublin centric focus, for too long”. She said she is not “a conventional Green” highlighting how she is a beef and sheep farmer. Ms Hackett added: “I’ve been actually the only Cabinet minister for the past four years, that is involved representing Offaly, not just at Cabinet, on the national stage, but also on the international stage ... “All of that gives an opportunity to be more relevant and more relatable to people outside of Dublin.” Ms Hackett rejected a suggestion that should would find it difficult to be elected in three-seat Offaly constituency in the next general election. “I dispute that I have no chance of winning office. “I mean, if I get this right, if I become leader, if I’m able to make the Green Party and its policies more relevant to people, that they’re easier and more affordable to people, I think people do want to do the right thing. And if I can crack that nut, I think that would, you know, support me in that engagement.” She added: “I don’t think it’s a foregone conclusion in any shape or form that I will not get elected to County Offaly. I’m in the same mix as many of my party colleagues across the country.” On her reason for backing Mr O’Gorman, Ms Chu told The Irish Times: “It’s a simple question of electoral maths and strategy, who can drive the Green agenda and ensure that the public sees the importance of fighting climate change in the next election.  Ms Chu, a former Green Party chairwoman added: “Having worked with Roderic on the leadership team when we got our best results in 2019 and 2020, I think he is the best declared candidate to ensure we bring as many people along to fight the climate emergency in the next election.” Meanwhile, Bray councillor Erika Doyle has backed Ms Hackett. In a post on social media platform X she said: “We are lucky to have two incredible candidates for leader in Roderic O’Gorman and Pippa Hackett. “My vote will go to Pippa, who has been a huge support to me over the years. “Sincere and focused, she has excellent leadership qualities and will bring a fresh voice to the role.” She added: “There appears to be a focus on who the elected [representatives] are supporting, but in the Green Party my vote is worth the same as any other member, be they a TD, councillor or regular member.” Dún Laoghaire councillor Tom Kivlehan is also backing Ms Hackett.  He said he knows both candidates and is a “tremendous supporter” of Mr O’Gorman who has a “really tough brief” in Government and has “done amazingly well”. However, he said what he was considering in the leadership contest is “voter appeal” Mr Kivlehan said a leader is someone that gets the party “in the public eye, converting people in and winning votes for you. “I just feel she might have that a little bit more and that’s why I nominated her.”",0,1
2024/6/20,"‘Get back in a room and sort this out’: Taoiseach calls on Aer Lingus pilots to return to talks Tánaiste Micheál Martin dismisses calls for intervention   Tánaiste Micheál Martin has dismissed a Sinn Féin call for Government intervention in the Aer Lingus industrial relations dispute and insisted that it can only be resolved through the industrial relations machinery of the State. He appealed to the disputing parties to get back into talks to resolve the dispute. “I would urge both sides now in the interests of the people of this country, to get around the table and to hammer out a resolution and a decision. That’s the only way that this can be done,” he said. Separately Taoiseach Simon Harris said that “people need to step back from the brink”. “ ‘The idea that passengers, children due to go on their summer holidays, would be used as pawns in an industrial relations dispute that has already been considered by the labour court is utterly reprehensible and people need to step back from the brink,” he said. “What can government do? Well, government already does quite a lot because government makes available the industrial relations mechanisms of the state, and I would absolutely encourage people to utilise them. A “So get back in a room and sort this out is my very clear message,” he added, while attending the citizenship ceremony at The Convention Centre. Mr Martin meanwhile was responding in the Dáil to Sinn Féin enterprise spokeswoman Louise O’Reilly who said time was running out to resolve the dispute before airline pilots begin a work to rule next Wednesday. “We cannot underestimate the impacts that the uncertainty is having, particularly for those considering traveling to Ireland for a holiday this summer,” she said, adding that the tourism sector was still recovering from the pandemic. There were “tens of thousands of workers and families who have saved hard for their annual holiday and who are worried sick that they won’t be able to travel”. Ms O’Reilly, a former Siptu trade union organiser, said the Government had a role to play. “The State’s industrial relations mechanisms believe that the sides are too far apart to engage and try to seek a resolution to the dispute at this time. It is therefore incumbent on Government to do so.” She said: “I understand well that we will not resolve this dispute here on the floor of the Dáil. But I also know when a high-level intervention is required, and this is one of those times.” Ms O’Reilly called for the Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke and Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan “to engage in a constructive manner to get all sides around the table”, given the seriousness of the dispute for families and the wider economy. But the Tánaiste told her: “You said it yourself. This dispute cannot be resolved to the floor of this House.” Mr Martin said that Ms O’Reilly had invoked her experience in industrial relations. “I agree 100 per cent that this is creating unacceptable anxiety to many, many families and it needs to be resolved.” But he said “the Deputy knows full well that the only way that this will get resolved is either in the WRC or in the Labour Court, but essentially it has to be resolved within the industrial relations machinery.” Mr Martin said “air connectivity is the lifeblood of an island nation. And that is why every effort must be made to resolve this and it is vital that both parties to this dispute act responsibly.” He said “we have a sophisticated industrial relations system in this country. The Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court remain available to the parties to facilitate engagement and that is the framework ultimately within which this matter can be resolved.”",0,1

Ascension to role of party’s deputy leader seen as step towards even greater things for 33-year-old Dubliner  The elevation of Minister of State Jack Chambers to the role of Fianna Fáil’s deputy leader on Wednesday is widely being seen as preparation for a further promotion next week. The 33 year old is tipped to become a senior minister and possibly the next minister for finance, with the vacancy occurring as Michael McGrath is expected to be announced as Ireland’s European commissioner. While Fianna Fáil leader and Tánaiste Micheál Martin rejected suggestions that McGrath was overlooked as deputy leader because of a potential move to Europe, those within the party are saying differently. One party source pointed to comments made by McGrath’s brother, Seamus, who won the highest number of first-preference votes in the country in the recent local elections that he would be “open” to running in the general election. “Seamus wouldn’t say those sort of things without [his brother] Micheal’s clearance,” the source said. “So immediately the expectation within the party was that Michael McGrath wanted to become the EU commissioner. Michael would be seen as one of the main contenders for the leadership but if he’s now going for the commissionership, Jack Chambers is likely the next choice.” A senior Fianna Fáil TD added: “There’s a change of the deck at the top at the moment. “You would imagine Michael is going to Europe and then he [Micheál Martin] has the decision who he gives finance to. Does he give it to himself, come out of foreign affairs, or give it to Darragh O’Brien and bring a young minister into housing? It stacks up on a couple of fronts and there’s no question, Jack has done his time.” Chambers was first elected to Fingal County Council in 2014, aged 23, and became a TD for Dublin West two years later. When Martin became taoiseach in June 2020, he nominated him as Minister of State at the Department of Finance. Two weeks later he became the Government’s chief whip and minister of State at the Department of Sport and Gaeltacht, following the sacking of Barry Cowen as minister for agriculture. Martin and Chambers are seen to have forged a close relationship during his time as chief whip. Chambers is currently Minister of State in the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and attends Cabinet. More recently, he was Fianna Fáil’s director of local elections and deemed to have done a good job, with the party securing the largest number of council seats at 248. Martin noted the positive feedback Chambers had received in the role “from around the country” and said he had been a “very effective” chief whip, which “merited the appointment”. He added that candidates had been receiving messages from the junior minister throughout the campaign, offering ongoing advice and mentoring. Another Fianna Fáil source said there had been a “push for a while” to get a deputy leader to look after party organisation and the Dublin West TD had been “effective” at engaging with backbenchers and Senators. While undoubtedly well-placed, whether Chambers will eventually become party leader is ultimately down to Fianna Fáil’s electoral college system, where party members and the national executive all get a say. Some within Fianna Fáil have also pointed to the fact that Chambers is from the capital, where the party has “problems”. “It’s almost a little bit ironic that the Green’s are debating how they can appeal more in rural Ireland, whereas in Fianna Fáil part of the debate is how the party can appeal more in Dublin,” the source said. “Having a younger Dublin leader will make a difference. This [promotion] is kind of lining him up for leader, particularly if you see him moving into the finance portfolio.”",0,1
2024/6/20,"Minister and Senator trade insults over landmark fertility and surrogacy law Stephen Donnelly accuses Rónán Mullen of ‘obsession’ with controlling women’s sexuality, while Mullen claims Donnelly may be ‘worst minister we have ever had’ There were bitter exchanges in the Seanad between Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly and Independent Senator Rónán Mullen during a debate on landmark legislation to regulate fertility treatment and surrogacy. The Minister accused Mr Mullen of being “an absolute disgrace” and setting himself up as a champion of women’s rights but that he had for years sought to control women and their reproductive health. “You have an obsession with controlling people’s sexuality.” The Senator in turn claimed Mr Donnelly is “probably the worst minister we have ever had, no friend of children with scoliosis, that’s for sure, but very good at the virtue-signalling politics that gets you plaudits in certain quarters”. Mr Mullen and Fine Gael Senator Mary Seery Kearney had earlier repeatedly clashed in sharp exchanges over amendments in the legislation including on international surrogacy. The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill has been planned for more than 20 years and is currently at the final stages in the Seanad, after which it will become law. A key element is the establishment of the Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority (AHRRA), to regulate technological advances in fertility and license fertility clinics. Surrogacy, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and embryo-screening procedures are also covered. The Seanad row erupted after Mr Mullen admonished those in the public gallery who re-acted to some of his comments on surrogacy, but he rejected Mr Donnelly’s claims he had “mocked them”. Mr Mullen said “I disagree with surrogacy. I disagree especially with international surrogacy. I think it breaches human rights and I reserve my right to say this is not some place of public entertainment where people can make noise in response to things they like or don’t like.” The Minister said Mr Mullen was an “absolute disgrace” and “without any irony is setting himself up as a defender of women’s rights”. He told Mr Mullen “you are no champion of women’s rights. You have sought for years to control women,” through the Constitution, through legislation, through dogma. “You have an obsession with controlling their reproductive health. You have an obsession with controlling people’s sexuality.” Mr Mullen said Mr Donnelly was “such a weak and verbally inadequate Minister who has no principles and whose only mission in life is to give the loudest and most influential lobbyists whatever they want”. Mr Mullen had said that international surrogacy should at the very least be confined to the EU because “there is simply no way that this can be policed remotely from Ireland”. But the Minister said: “We’re not doing it in some bizarre geopolitical line on a map. We’re doing it in a considered, legally robust jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction and case-by-case basis.” Earlier, Labour Senator Marie Sherlock said clinicians had been operating with uncertainty for many years, and patients were also affected by the “Wild West that has prevailed in some circumstances”, with some fertility clinics “operating in a profit-driven sector”. She welcomed provisions to preserve the reproductive tissue of children under 18 “facing a treatment that will significantly or permanently diminish their fertility”. But she questioned why the Minister would not include an amendment to help children for whom infertility is a side effect of a progressive condition they have. The measure had been included in the original version of the Bill. Mr Donnelly said he would bring forward amending legislation in September because “there is a danger the entire Bill would not get through all stages of the Oireachtas in the next three weeks and that is something I am not willing to allow happen”.",0,1
2024/6/20,"O’Gorman edges ahead of Hackett in contest to be next Green Party leader Winner to face challenge of rebounding from the party’s poor results in the local and European elections  Roderic O’Gorman took an early lead in terms of public endorsements from the Green Party’s elected representatives as the contest to become the next leader of the party shapes up as a showdown with one other candidate — Pippa Hackett. By Wednesday evening, 12 of the 23 Green Party councillors returned in the local elections had announced they were supporting Mr O’Gorman compared to one for Ms Hackett. However, her supporters were out from early morning to bat for their preferred candidate with party chairwoman Senator Pauline O’Reilly, Minister of State Ossian Smyth and TDs Brian Leddin and Steven Matthews backing her before she confirmed she was running on Wednesday afternoon.. Among those backing Mr O’Gorman are Ministers of State Malcolm Noonan and Joe O’Brien as well as TDs Marc Ó Cathasaigh and Patrick Costello. When added together, this leaves O’Gorman with 16 backers to date compared to Ms Hackett’s five. Ultimately, regardless of public declarations of support from Oireachtas members and councillors, the more than 4,000 members of the Green Party will determine the winner through the one-member, one-vote system operated by the party. Last night the party said it expects to reveal the name of Eamon Ryan’s replacement as leader on July 8th. The party’s executive committee met on Wednesday night and said afterwards it had written to all members to inform them nominations for the leadership contest can be submitted from 9am on Thursday until 9pm on Monday. The names of those standing for leader will be made public on the morning of Tuesday, June 25th. Candidates need 50 nominations from full party members. Whoever emerges as the winner will face the challenge of rebounding from the Green Party’s poor results in the local and European elections during which it lost about half of its council seats as well as its two MEPs. Dublin West TD and Minister for Integration Mr O’Gorman was the first to announce he was running to replace  Ryan. In a social media post on Wednesday morning, he highlighted his experience in Government and his more than two decades of Green Party membership as he made his pitch for support from members. During the day Mr O’Gorman rebuffed suggestions that Ms Hackett would be better placed to appeal to rural Ireland where the party has had difficulty attracting support amid political attacks over the impact of climate action measures on farming in particular. Mr O’Gorman said she is a “fantastic colleague” and “excellent Minister” but it is “simplistic to say if we have someone living in rural Ireland — ‘problem solved’.” One of his supporters, Mr O’Brien, told The Irish Times that Mr O’Gorman “knows every root and branch of the party nationwide”, has experience as a senior minister in Cabinet, and has “had some tough challenges but he’s managed them well”. Making her pitch, Ms Hackett told Newstalk she believed she could be a “fresh start” for the party” and she billed herself as “not your conventional Green” adding: “I live in rural Ireland. I’m a beef and sheep farmer. I’m also a mother. I’ve also been in Cabinet for the last four years.” Offaly-based Senator Ms Hackett, a “super junior” Minister of State for agriculture with a seat at Cabinet said the party has never had a non-Dublin or woman leader adding that her “perspective and certainly my different life experiences can make the Green Party relevant and relatable”. Mr Leddin praised Ms Hackett’s “immense ability” and said: “All of our leaders have been from Dublin and there’s a very strong narrative the party is Dublin-centric. We’re not going to dispel that narrative by choosing our next leader from Dublin as well.”",0,1
2024/6/21,"Hackett and O’Gorman secure nominations to officially enter Green Party leadership contest Senator and Minister are expected to be only two candidates to compete for Eamon Ryan’s former position Both of the contenders vying to be the next Green Party leader Pippa Hackett and Roderic O’Gorman have secured the required 50 nominations to enter the contest. While the nominations period remains open until Monday night, the Cabinet colleagues are expected to be the only two candidates in the race to succeed Eamon Ryan who announced his intention to depart as party leader earlier this week. Ms Hackett picked up some additional endorsements and has overtaken Mr O’Gorman in terms of the number of Oireachtas members backing her with five TDs or Senators openly supporting her compared to four for Mr O’Gorman. She still trails in the number of elected representatives overall who have made a public declaration of support. Clare-based Senator Róisín Garvey is the latest Oireachtas member to back Ms Hackett who is a Minister of State for Agriculture and farmer in Co Offaly. In a post on social media platform X Ms Garvey said Ms Hackett is “always up at dawn” and “always listens” adding she is “ready, willing and able to lead our party”. She added: “rural and regional balance needed now more than ever”. Ms Hackett’s supporters have been highlighting her rural credentials in contrast to O’Gorman who would be another Dublin-based leader for the party. For his part Mr O’Gorman, the Minister for Children and Integration, has pushed back on suggestions that the party needs a leader from outside Dublin to improve its popularity in rural Ireland. As well as securing the necessary 50 nominations Ms Hackett’s team also now believes she has five of the party’s elected councillors backing her. Thirteen councillors have declared support for Mr O’Gorman. While both sides welcome such endorsements it is the Green Party’s 4,000-plus members on both sides of the border who will have the ultimate say in who becomes leader on July 8th as the party operates a one member, one vote system. The leader of the Green Party in Northern Ireland, Senator Malachaí O’Hara, confirmed on Friday that he will not be making a public declaration of support.",0,1
2024/6/21,"High Court Sipo decision is a bad outcome for Leo Varadkar - and ethics watchdog The former taoiseach faces more scrutiny of questionable actions when he first led the Government.  Paul Murphy TD has secured a notable legal and political victory in the High Court. In a long-awaited judgment, Mr Justice Barry O’Donnell said the People Before Profit deputy can have an order requiring the State’s ethics watchdog to look again at Leo Varadkar’s leak of a draft medical contract during his first term as taoiseach. According to the court, the explanations of the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) for not carrying out an inquiry were inadequately reasoned. Its original decision on the former taoiseach has now been quashed. This is a bad outcome for Varadkar, who faces yet more scrutiny of questionable actions when he first led the Government. But with his career past its heyday after his abrupt resignation as taoiseach, the court’s ruling on Friday will have little impact on the former Fine Gael leader as he mulls his future from the backbenches. For Sipo, however, the ruling deals a severe blow to its reputation and credibility. What is more, this very outcome was foreseen when two of the most senior independent officials in the State dissented from the commission’s decision not to carry out an inquiry into Varadkar’s decision to leak an important document to one of his doctor pals. In private statements two years ago questioning how Varadkar defended the leak, Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) Seamus McCarthy and Ombudsman Ger Deering dissented from the Sipo’s decision to refuse a preliminary inquiry into the affair. They were outvoted by three other Sipo commissioners: the chairman Garrett Sheehan, a retired Court of Appeal judge; Peter Finnegan, clerk of the Dáil; and Martin Groves, clerk of the Seanad. McCarthy made a note saying some of Varadkar’s assertions “represent low-grade evidence at best” and Deering said his claims that the draft contract was no longer confidential were not supported by his own statements or public records. All of this was set out in records Sipo released under the Freedom of Information Act. But Sipo redacted some of the files. It was only after an appeal to the Information Commissioner – an office held by Deering – that further disclosures were made. These showed McCarthy’s concern about the potential for Sipo facing “credibility” issues as a result of the Varadkar case. “Would our arguments be enough to satisfy a judge in a judicial review proceeding (whichever way we go)?” McCarthy asked as Sipo considered its stance. “A court order to reconsider rejection of a complaint would be appalling, and would compromise the credibility of any subsequent decision we made. A court order to stop an inquiry would at least explain why we had no power to pursue a complaint in this matter.” With Mr Justice O’Donnell’s ruling, that “appalling” prospect has now come to pass. This very bad for the standards commission, the body that is supposed to promote transparency and accountability in public life. That it relates to a decision concerning the actions of a taoiseach makes it all the worse.",0,1
2024/6/24,"Parties expected to put McGrath forward for European commissioner There is intense speculation in Government circles about a replacement for the Minister for Finance, should he be the commission nominee The leaders of the three Government parties are expected to discuss the name of Ireland’s next European commissioner on Monday, before the nomination is approved by the Cabinet at its meeting on Tuesday. The universal expectation in Government is that the name of Minister for Finance Michael McGrath will be the one forwarded to Brussels in advance of a summit of European leaders in Brussels later this week. If Mr McGrath leaves his post immediately, the move would create a vacancy in the Department of Finance just weeks before the Government finalises the Summer Economic Statement in early July, a key budgetary document which will set the fiscal parameters for the autumn budget. There is intense speculation in Government circles about a replacement for Mr McGrath, should he be the commission nominee, with the names of junior ministers Jack Chambers and Dara Calleary figuring prominently. Mr Chambers was last week named as the new deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, and Tánaiste Micheál Martin heaped praise on him for his management of the party’s local election campaign, which saw the party remain as the largest party of local government. There is understood to be a concern that the Government should quickly nominate a new European commissioner in order to give the candidate the best chance of securing a substantial and influential portfolio in the new European Commission. EU leaders are set to resume discussions this week on who should lead European institutions for the next five years, with Ursula von der Leyen in the driving seat for reappointment as president of the European Commission. Mr Martin travels to Luxembourg on Monday for a meeting of EU foreign ministers, where discussions will be dominated by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the situation in Gaza. The heads of EU governments will meet on Thursday and Friday in Brussels.",0,1
2024/6/24,"EU must do more to unblock funding for Palestine, Tánaiste says Micheál Martin says Ireland will back Ursula von der Leyen for European Commission president The European Union needs to do more to “unblock” funding to support the Palestinian Authority following reforms by the governing entity, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has said. The authority, which currently controls parts of the West Bank, had the ability to be “effective” and take over the running of Gaza from Hamas militants in the aftermath of Israel’s war in the area, he said. Mr Martin said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “dire” and it was clear Israel was violating international humanitarian law on a “systemic basis”. “This has to come to an end. We need the immediate release of hostages and we need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” he said. More than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza health authorities, since Israel invaded the strip in response to the October 7th attacks in southern Israel by Hamas, which left 1,200 people dead. Speaking in Luxembourg before a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Mr Martin said Ireland would be pushing for the EU to be “far more proactive” in supporting the Palestinian Authority following reforms. “Europe needs to do far more, far more quickly to unblock funding to the Palestinian Authority,” he said. Separately, Mr Martin reiterated that the Government would be backing Ursula von der Leyen for a second term as European Commission president. He said it was clear that Ms von der Leyen “will emerge as the single candidate” for commission president following a summit of the 27 EU leaders later this week, he said. The Fianna Fáil leader said the three Coalition leaders would on Monday evening discuss who Ireland would nominate as its next EU commissioner, with a name then being brought to Cabinet on Tuesday. Under the Coalition agreement it is Fianna Fáil’s turn to choose a commissioner, with Minister for Finance Michael McGrath heavily tipped to take the job. “We’ll be putting forward a very high caliber candidate, that is what counts,” Mr Martin said. The gains made by far right parties across Europe in the recent European Parliament elections in countries like France were concerning, Mr Martin said. “Ireland has had a somewhat different result perhaps. There are straws in the wind in terms of the growth of certain parties and movements which we cannot ignore.” The Tánaiste also said he welcomed the fact that Ukraine’s progress towards joining the EU was moving along, with “great credit” due to Kyiv for managing this during a war. “I think it reflects a level of competence and genuine commitment on behalf of the Ukrainian government to joining the European Union,” he said.",0,1
2024/6/24,"Michael McGrath to be nominated as Ireland’s next European Commissioner Nomination of Minister for Finance to be brought to Cabinet for approval on Tuesday with resignation to follow shortly after Minister for Finance Michael McGrath is expected to be nominated as Ireland’s next European Commissioner following discussions between the Coalition party leaders on Monday evening. Tánaiste Micheál Martin is due to bring a note on the nomination to Cabinet on Tuesday morning to officially begin the process. It is expected that should Cabinet approve Mr McGrath’s nomination for the role of commissioner, which has an annual salary of about €300,000, he will then tender his resignation as minister in the coming days, with his successor due to be appointed shortly. There is speculation within political circles that potential successors to Mr McGrath could be Minister of State in the Department of Enterprise Dara Calleary, Minister of State in the Department of Transport Jack Chambers or Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien. Mr Chambers was appointed as Fianna Fáil deputy leader last week. A move into the Department of Finance by any of these three would then open a vacancy for their positions. Sources have said Mr Martin will move fast to appoint successors, but that he is “keeping his cards close to his chest” until Mr McGrath’s nomination is noted at Cabinet. The new minister for finance will have to take the reins at a time when July’s Summer Economic Statement is being finalised, and ahead of a crucial period for Budget 2025 negotiations. The statement is a key budgetary document which will set the fiscal parameters for the autumn budget. Coalition party leaders agreed not to delay nominating a new European commissioner in the hopes of securing a high-profile portfolio in the new European Commission. There was an unwritten agreement between the three Coalition parties that the next commissioner would be a Fianna Fáil nominee. The timeline for any departure by Mr McGrath will be outlined in the coming days, with some sources insisting he could still continue with budget preparations in the coming weeks while others have said a mini re-shuffle would not be problematic as much of the budgetary preparations are well under way. Fine Gael’s Mairead McGuinness is Ireland’s current commissioner, holding the portfolio of Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union. She was appointed after the resignation of Phil Hogan as EU Trade Commissioner following the controversy around the “golfgate” hotel gathering during the Covid-19 pandemic. The expected nomination of Mr McGrath will also leave an opening in his home constituency of Cork South-Central in the upcoming general election. He first ran for the Dáil in 2007 and has been re-elected on every occasion since then. In the recent local elections, Mr McGrath’s brother Seamus McGrath pulled in the largest first preference vote in the State, breaking the 5,000 mark in Carrigaline and easily passing the quota, while helping his party colleague Audrey Buckley over the line.",0,1
2024/6/24,"Who is Michael McGrath? Father-of-seven and former accountant’s long political career leads to Europe Minister for Finance spends as much time on the sidelines as he can watching his children’s sporting exploits He sat his Leaving Certificate at only 16, contested his first election at 22 and delivered his first budget as minister for finance at the age of 47. Now, Fianna Fáil Cork South Central TD and father-of-seven Michael McGrath is on the verge of becoming Ireland’s next European Commissioner. Within the Department of Finance – and also within the Department of Public Expenditure where he was previously the Minister – officials who work alongside McGrath note with semi-puzzlement that he is genuinely interested in the deepest intricacies of the Irish tax system. Instead of being worn down by the process of delivering Budget 2024, he told those around him that he loved it. When he unveiled the last budget, he became the first Fianna Fáil Minister to do so in more than a decade. It was not lost on political observers that, notwithstanding the scale of the €14 billion package, McGrath was keen to place a strong emphasis on caution and prudence. “I will manage our nation’s finances carefully for the sake of the generations that come after us,” he told the Dáil while announcing multi-billion euro future-proof funds. After years of struggling to shake off accusations by Fine Gael and others of “wrecking the economy”, McGrath’s even-handed and calm delivery of a budget that was both large in scope but also future-aware was a key moment for Fianna Fáil in repairing its standing with the public and detoxifying the brand. McGrath appears to have inherited a lot of his work ethic from his late father Jack who worked as a manual labourer on a range of jobs from factory worker to van driver. He has previously spoken about how money was tight when he was growing up as one of five children. His mother, Marie, worked as a housewife and McGrath has described her as a “rock who is there for us at any time, no matter what”. She takes a keen interest in her son’s career and was recently spotted in April at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis. McGrath became the first in his family to go to college. Having studied Commerce at UCC, he went on to qualify as a chartered accountant before going on to work in both the private and public sector. Interested in politics, history and current affairs, he contested his first election at the age of 22 in the local town council in Passage West. He worked as the financial controller for Red FM but later quit his secure job to run in the 2007 general election for Fianna Fáil. He was elected on his first attempt and has been re-elected in every election since: 2011, 2016 and 2020. Appointed as the party’s spokesman for finance in 2011, he responded to nine budgets from the Opposition benches. He was a central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks and in June 2020, was appointed as minister for public expenditure and reform. In his personal life, he is not a politician who is often spotted out at high-profile events and seems content to spend his spare time on the sidelines of pitches, with his five boys and two girls playing a vast array of different sports. Earlier this year, he spoke to The Irish Times about the challenges of preparing a budget while trying to be present in a large family. “Working parents, generally, will understand the juggling that is involved in working full time. We both work full-time and raise children. It’s a trade-off. You’d love to have more time with them but you also have an important job to do and you want to set a good example about work ethic and having ambition and doing your best and making a difference. “Life is very busy, it is very full. I enjoy spending all of my downtime with them, generally at their matches on the sidelines getting cold and enjoying the victories and the defeats and being there with them as much as I possibly can.”",0,1
2024/6/25,"Jack Chambers named as new Minister for Finance Chambers replaces Michael McGrath who has been nominated as Ireland’s next European commissioner Jack Chambers has been selected to take on the role of Minister for Finance, replacing Michael McGrath who has been nominated by the Government as Ireland’s next European commissioner. The Dublin West Fianna Fáil TD is to take the reins at the Department of Finance as the Coalition prepares for its crucial last budget before the next general election. Tánaiste Micheál Martin described Mr Chambers as a “very able, intelligent, highly effective politician”, adding that he had “no doubt he will make a very effective Minister for Finance”. Mr Chambers was announced as Fianna Fáil deputy leader last week. Speaking in the Dáil on Tuesday afternoon, Taoiseach Simon Harris said Mr Chambers would be formally nominated as Minister for Finance in the Dáil on Wednesday afternoon and there would be a vote by TDs. Earlier, Mr Harris described Mr McGrath as “a dedicated public servant, a skilled Minister and an extremely diligent and hard worker”. The Taoiseach said he would be bringing his nomination to the European Council later this week and he added that he hoped member states’ nominee for commission president would be finalised at the same meeting. Outgoing commission president Ursula von der Leyen is widely expected to be nominated by the council for a second term but will face a vote in the European Parliament before she can be confirmed in the position. Mr Martin praised Mr McGrath for his “shrewd stewardship” of the economy in his time as both minister for finance and minister for public expenditure. He said one of Mr McGrath’s “great legacies will be the Future Ireland Fund and the Climate Infrastructure Fund which are about future-proofing this country”. Asked what portfolio he would prefer at EU level, Mr McGrath, a chartered accountant by profession, said an economic or financial portfolio would “seem to be an obvious area” given his qualifications and political experience. “But it is something we will discuss over the days ahead. And as you know, when it comes to the allocation of different portfolios by the president of the commission, there are many factors that come into play.” Mr McGrath said it was “an incredible honour” to be nominated as Ireland’s commissioner. He thanked the people of his constituency, Cork South Central, and also said: “I certainly could not have done any of this without the extraordinary love and support of my family, especially my wife Sarah.” Mr McGrath said the past four years in Government had been hugely rewarding. “There really hasn’t been a dull moment,” he said. “I’m leaving the Department of Finance at a time when our economy is in very good health overall.” He said Mr Chambers “has all the qualities to be an excellent Minister for Finance”. “He has the intellect, he has the integrity and I think he will continue the very good working relationship that I have developed with Minister Paschal Donohoe over the last number of years.” Mr Martin was asked by reporters if Ireland would put forward a woman nominee for commissioner if Ms von der Leyen asks for gender-balanced options as she did previously. “All the indications are that Ursula von der Leyen will be the president and then there’s a formal process. The president may write to the Government. The Government will consider that at that stage, but essentially, we have recommended Michael McGrath as our nominee,” he said. The nomination of Mr McGrath was discussed at a meeting of the three Coalition leaders on Monday before being approved at Cabinet on Tuesday. Mr Harris said that although the European commissioner nominee was made by Fianna Fáil under the terms of the programme for government, it was not “a party political” position. “For me, this isn’t about tribal politics or party politics or partisan politics, just by putting our best foot forward and about sending the best person that we can to the European Commission.” Mr McGrath succeeds Fine Gael-nominated commissioner Mairead McGuinness. Mr Harris signalled that the Government was hoping for an economic portfolio for Mr McGrath in the next European Commission. Mr Harris said he would be attending a European Council summit later this week. “I will obviously do so armed with the name of the person that Ireland wishes to be our next commissioner and that will I suppose enable Ireland to begin to engage on what portfolios might be appropriate. “It’s important we take this step by step but I do think that a portfolio in the economic space is often an area that Ireland would seek.”",0,1
2024/6/25,"Jack Chambers: young Dublin West TD catapulted into the deep end of Irish politics Recently appointed deputy leader of Fianna Fáil takes over at the most heavyweight of Government departments And while leadership elections are invariably decided by factors such as the prevailing political climate of the time and the preparation undertaken by the candidates, and though the preferences of the outgoing leader are unlikely to sway the contest, there is no doubt that the announcements of recent days have brought Chambers into the very front rank of national politics. There is likely to be some surprise in the ranks of Fianna Fáil. The Department of Finance is a big step up for any politician; for one who has not yet commanded a department of state, it is especially so. Chambers was highly regarded by Martin when he served as chief whip during the period 2020-2022, when Martin was in the Taoiseach’s office. Martin considered appointing him as Minister for Health at the end of that period but made him a super-junior minister at the Department of Transport – sitting at Cabinet but without the authority of a full department – where he has frequently wrestled behind the scenes with Eamon Ryan. But it was his role as director of elections for the recent local elections campaign that really confirmed Martin’s admiration for his organisational and political skills. Fianna Fáil minimised expected losses and emerged – by a whisker – as the largest party in local government, just pipping Fine Gael (and Fianna Fáilers love that) and beating Sinn Féin into a distant third place. Announcing his appointment last week, Martin paid him extravagant tributes, indicating a central role for Chambers in planning the next general election campaign. That’s a process which, you can be sure, is already under way. Chambers will now combine that political role in planning the next general election with the heaviest of the heavyweight jobs in Government. Along with the Department of Public Expenditure – housed in the same building, and until the economic crash part of the finance department – the power of the Department of Finance ranges all the way across Government and into every aspect of the Government’s activities. Ministers for Finance tend to be powerful, impactful figures in the governments they serve; the roll call of alumni – whose portraits hang in the department – includes giants of Irish politics including Charles Haughey, John Bruton, Ray MacSharry, Albert Reynolds, Ruairi Quinn, Bertie Ahern, Charlie McCreevy and Michael Noonan. Many went on to become Taoiseach. Not for nothing used McCreevy remind Ahern that the position was the only minister’s job mentioned in the Constitution. In some administrations, the Minister for Finance has been almost on a par with the Taoiseach. This is the office to which the 33-year-old Chambers, a TD since just 2016, now ascends. He does so at a time when the political stakes have rarely been higher. In early July he and Paschal Donohoe must agree and publish the summer economic statement, a key budgetary document which will set the fiscal parameters for the autumn budget. Budget 2025 – whether in October as currently scheduled or a few weeks beforehand – will be the last significant political act of the Coalition and inevitably the precursor to the general election itself. Chambers will have to balance the pressures from his fellow ministers for a pre-election spending splurge with the Government’s commitments to maintain spending discipline. It will be essential to establish from the outset a productive and trusting relationship with Paschal Donohoe in the Department of Public Expenditure. Donohoe and the outgoing minister Michael McGrath had a close relationship that was vital to the functioning of government; on budgetary issues, they formed a sort of axis of prudence, resisting the demands for spending increases and tax cuts even at a time when corporation tax revenues continued to flow into the Exchequer. If that does not continue, the character of the Coalition will change. As with every political appointment, there will be some resentment in Fianna Fáil, though Martin is well used to that. In some quarters, Chambers is seen as Martin’s teacher’s pet. He does not have the sort of political or governing experience that most new Ministers for Finance bring to the role. Yes, he is bright and clearly has his boss’s confidence. But he is in at the deep end now.",0,1
2024/6/26,"Michael McGrath ‘not motivated by money’ in decision to become Irish EU commissioner Outgoing Minister for Finance stands to earn package of more than €440,000 a year on taking up role later this year Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath has said money is not a factor in his decision to leave his role as Minister for Finance to become Ireland’s next European Commissioner. The Cork South Central TD, whose nomination for the commission was approved by the Cabinet yesterday, will receive annual remuneration of up to €443,000 when he moves to Brussels, double his pay as a Minister, as he stands to benefit from large tax-free family allowances for his seven children. Asked about the pay package during an interview on Newstalk on Wednesday, Mr McGrath said the salary is standard for all commissioners, is paid out of the EU budget and that he does not have a say on the matter. “I was never motivated by money in any decision that I made. In my life, I have always been motivated by a desire to give public service,” he said. Mr McGrath said he has been an elected representative since becoming a town councillor aged 22 in 1999 and has enjoyed “every moment” of that time. He noted he would remain a TD for the next four months, even though party colleague Jack Chambers is set to succeed him as Minister for Finance. An attraction to the EU job, he added, was having a chance to shape policy on an international stage across areas ranging from trade to climate change while having a direct impact on “pretty much every facet of Irish life and of the lives of citizens from across the European Union”. Mr McGrath could stand to earn up to €488,000 if he is appointed to one of seven commission vice-presidencies. Commentators suspect a minister from a brief as senior as Mr McGrath’s was nominated with a view to securing one of the major economic briefs for Ireland. He said he believed his skill set in the financial and economic areas could see him “hit the ground running” but that it is a “competitive” field and many member states are vying for different positions. Ursula von der Leyen is expected to be proposed later this week for a second term as European Commission president, but she has faced criticism about some decisions taken during her first stint. Ahead of the European elections, several Fianna Fáil candidates said they did not intend to back her. Mr McGrath said Ms von der Leyen would face a democratic test in the European Parliament and noted that MEPs had approved her last time around by a “very tight” margin. He said although she has not got everything right, including comments made during a trip to Tel Aviv shortly after the Hamas attack on October 7th, “she has been a very good friend to Ireland” particularly during Brexit-related negotiations. Asked if he would encourage Fianna Fáil MEPs to support Ms von der Leyen’s candidacy, he said he did not think “public pleadings or declarations really are the way to go”. “We will continue to engage with them, but we respect their mandates. They have been elected by the people in the last few weeks. And I think that has to be acknowledged and recognised and respected. And it will be, but we will have respectful discussions over the days ahead about what is in Ireland’s national interest.”",0,1
2024/6/26,"Tax-free allowances for Michael McGrath’s seven children will bring EU pay package to €443,000 a year New EU commissioner will receive a base salary of €314,000 plus entertainment, household and residence allowances Incoming EU commissioner Michael McGrath will receive annual remuneration up to €443,000 when he moves to Brussels, as he stands to benefit from large tax-free family allowances for his seven children. With generous monthly payments for child dependents and their education, his elevation to the European Commission will more than double his pay as TD and Minister for Finance. But McGrath may yet receive a larger package if he is appointed to one of seven commission vice-presidencies, a more senior post that would pay him up to €488,000. McGrath’s monthly pay will be about €26,169.29. He will also receive residence, household and entertainment allowances – and allowances for children that continue in early adult years if they remain in education. Payments for commissioners who are parents include a dependent child allowance of €471.80 per month per child. In McGrath’s case the annual benefit will be €39,631.20. In addition, commissioners can claim an allowance for “actual education costs” up to €320.12 per month for each dependent child. In McGrath’s case the potential annual benefit will be €26,890.08. Asked whether dependent child and education allowances were subject to income tax, the commission said: “Allowances are not taxed (they are deducted from the taxable basis).” As a Minister in Dublin, McGrath’s annual pay was €204,571. Such remuneration, increased this month under a national deal with public sector unions, comprised his €112,553 TD’s salary and €92,018 ministerial pay. After the Cabinet signed off on his nomination to Ireland’s commission seat, his pay will rise to levels far above the Taoiseach’s €241,480 salary. EU regulations suggest McGrath’s annual salary as an ordinary commission member will be about €314,031.47. If he becomes a vice-president, the salary would be €348,923.85. The annual residence allowance is worth 15 per cent of salary, €47,104.72 for ordinary commissioners or €52,388.58 for vice-presidents. As an ordinary commissioner, he will receive a €607.71 monthly entertainment allowance. This allowance, for “meals and other forms of representation tasks”, is worth €7,292.52 per year. Vice-presidents receive €10,936.56. He also stands to receive an annual household allowance for married officials, set at €215.91 per month plus 2 per cent of basic salary – €8,871.54 for ordinary commissioners or €9,569.40 for vice-presidents. This too is tax-free. The European Commission said salaries were set by member states, adding that commissioners pay a progressive tax rate “up to 45 per cent” and social security contributions. “The maximum rate [45 per cent] applies to most of their salary, as they hold the most senior positions in the commission. Additionally, commissioners pay a solidarity levy [an additional tax] of 7 per cent.”",0,1
2024/6/26,"Funeral of Bernard Allen remembers ‘an astute political mind, devoted husband and treasured dad’ Former TD worked hard for people of Cork but left ‘politics at the front door’ when he returned home, mourners hear Former Fine Gael politician Bernard Allen was a hardworking servant for the people of Cork but left “politics at the front door” when he returned home to his beloved family, his funeral Mass has heard. Taoiseach Simon Harris, Tánaiste Micheál Martin, Olympic silver medallist John Treacy and Bishop Fintan Gavin of Cork and Ross were among those who gathered to pay tribute to the former Cork North-Central deputy who died last week aged 79 following a short illness. President Michael D Higgins was represented by his aide-de-camp Col Stephen Howard. Mr Allen’s daughter Lorraine told mourners at North Cathedral in Cork that her father was known locally and nationally for his work in politics but to her, her sisters Audrey and Deirdre and their mother Marie, he was a “devoted husband and treasured dad”. He also took a great interest in his grandchildren, mourners heard. “For such a public figure he was a very private family person. Politics was always left at the front door and he loved being home,” she said. She said Mr Allen’s political career began when he ran in the 1979 local elections following the death of his uncle, Sammy Allen. He ran in the 1981 general election and was returned at every election until his retirement in 2011. “What was always lovely for us to hear when we were out canvassing in the numerous local and general elections was the true impact he had on people,” she said, adding that her father took an interest in people, listened and wanted to help in any way he could. She said Mr Allen had an “astute political mind” and enjoyed sparring with colleagues across the political divide during his time as chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. Bishop Noel O’Regan, the chief celebrant at the Mass, said Mr Allen was a loyal, kind and approachable man who would be remembered for his joy and humour.",0,1
2024/6/27,"Dara Calleary returns to Cabinet as new Government super junior minister   James Lawless appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Transport Fianna Fáil Minister of State Dara Calleary has been named as the new super junior who sits at Cabinet following the promotion of Jack Chambers as Minister for Finance. Mr Chambers took up the role this week after his predecessor, Michael McGrath, was put forward as Ireland’s next EU Commissioner. Mr Calleary will retain his current portfolio as as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, with responsibility for trade promotion, digital and company regulation. Mr Chambers’s move to the Department of Finance left open his role as Minister of State, which will be filled by Kildare North TD James Lawless. Mr Lawless will hold special responsibility for international and road transport and logistics at the Department of Transport, and special responsibility for postal policy at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. Tánaiste Micheál Martin announced both appointments on Thursday afternoon. Appointed as chief whip when the Government was formed in July 2020, Mr Calleary became Minister for Agriculture shortly afterwards when Barry Cowen was sacked by Taoiseach Micheál Martin. However, within a few weeks Mr Calleary had resigned in the midst of a controversy over his attendance at the Oireachtas Golf Society Dinner in Clifden during Covid restrictions. He remained on the backbenches until the summer of 2022, when he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise following the resignation of Robert Troy. Mr Calleary is from a family with a strong allegiance to Fianna Fáil and has been a TD since 2007. His grandfather Phelim Calleary was a TD for Mayo North from 1952 to 1969 and his father, Seán, was TD for Mayo East from 1973 to 1992. Mr Lawless was first elected for Fianna Fáil in Kildare North in the 2016 general election, having been a councillor for the two years prior to that. He studied law at the Kings Inns, as well as having degrees in maths and computer science from TCD. He worked in systems analysis before politics. He was re-elected in 2020, and since then has served as the chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice.",0,1
2024/6/27,"O’Gorman and Hackett pledge to win back voters who have drifted away from Greens Both candidates for Green Party leadership make their pitch to supporters in first hustings ahead of online vote  The Green Party has held its first leadership hustings with both Roderic O’Gorman and Pippa Hackett pledging to win back voters who have drifted away from the party. Mr O’Gorman and Ms Hackett were confirmed as the two contenders after Eamon Ryan announced that he would be stepping down from the role and would not contest the next general election. The first hustings was held in Trinity College Dublin, where both candidates made their pitch to party supporters ahead of an online vote which will be held between July 4th and 7th. Mr O’Gorman said if the Green Party relied solely on its core vote in the next general election it would lose Dáil seats. “I am not standing for leader to manage decline or head back into the wilderness. I will not accept defeat. I am standing for leader to hold our seats and grow our seats and win in every part of Ireland,” he said. He said people felt the Green Party was “not speaking for their day-to-day concerns” and if the party did not do that “we will struggle to move beyond 4 per cent” in the polls. Ms Hackett said: “I want us all to be unapologetically Green ... As your leader I will make sure that we keep public-transport fees low and that we will keep investing in public-transport infrastructure. “The potential to expand our rail network is massive.” She said while the Green Party had invested in active travel over the past four years, “our roads need to be safe too”; that should mean rolling out “camera-based enforcement at scale”, among other measures. She also said climate change needed to come with a just transition. “If the just transition isn’t working for the people of the midlands, then it won’t work for anyone.” Mr O’Gorman said he had taken a tough line on a number of occasions in Government to stand firm on Green Party policies around the mother and baby homes redress scheme and migration policies. “No one joins this party for an easy life. They join it to deliver on policies – and this is what I’ve done. No other minister before me had even reduced the cost of childcare. I halved it. No minister before me had to face the unprecedented humanitarian crisis – the largest war on the European continent since the second World War. I have housed 100,000 people fleeing here, looking for shelter. “For decades adopted people were refused their birth information. It was seen as legally impossible to give it to them. I changed that. Has it been tough? Absolutely. The first week in the job, you might recall there were people outside the Dáil demanding that I resign and they had my image with a noose around it.” Both candidates were asked which politicians from outside Ireland they admired most. Ms Hackett said former US president Barack Obama, and Mr O’Gorman said David Blunkett, who served in Tony Blair’s cabinet, who he said had been focused on the delivery of social policy.",0,1
2024/6/27,"‘I have young children, I have a wife’: Taoiseach says bomb hoax at his home intended to ‘intimidate and upset’  Simon Harris was asked if he would have to move or if he intended to stay in his home and he said: ‘I’m staying in my home’ Speaking at he entered a summit of EU leaders in Brussels, Mr Harris said: “I don’t really wish to comment on it other than to say obviously this is clearly unacceptable situation. Even the word hoax I’m not sure is a fair word as I’ve no doubt these things are done to intimidate and upset. I have young children, I have a wife,” he said, “and it’s a really unacceptable situation.” Mr Harris also said that when people turn up outside it his house it should not be described in media reports as a “protest”. “I do think, and I say this really respectfully, that I think that all of us in our discourse including media needs to reflect on how we sometimes comment on these matters. You know, if masked men turned up outside your house, it wouldn’t be described as protest. It’s not protest if it happens outside my house either,” Mr Harris said. Asked if he would have to move or if he intended to stay in his home, he said: “I’m staying in my home.”",0,1
2024/6/27,"Fianna Fáil MEPs’ stance against  von der Leyen may work against McGrath Governments will become supplicants to the European Commission president if as expected she secures a second term Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy swooshed in and out of Brussels for the summit of European Union leaders on Thursday, thanking member states for their support and pleading for more military aid. In his wake, EU leaders were left wrangling not so much over the life-and-death issue of aid for Ukraine but over the EU’s favourite parlour game: who gets the top jobs? Once every five years, Brussels is consumed by speculation over who is set for what role. It goes without saying that the citizens of Europe have much less interest in this than the political classes. At home, the now ex-minister for finance Michael McGrath watches on intently. EU leaders are expected to haggle late into the night over the appointments to lead the key institutions of the union – the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament and the foreign service – for the next five years. A deal was all but done earlier this week, with Ursula von der Leyen securing another term as president of the commission, the most powerful of the jobs. Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, however, threw a spanner in the works, protesting that the carve-up between the centre-right European People’s Party (of which Fine Gael is a member), the centrist Renew group (Fianna Fáil is a member) and the centre-left social democrats excluded both Italy and her right-wing ECR alliance, which has made significant gains in the recent elections. EU leaders were hurriedly trying to placate Meloni with soothing words as they entered the summit. If the deal, or something like it, holds, then the focus will switch to the European Parliament, which will have to vote on von der Leyen’s nomination in the coming weeks. That will inevitably bring a focus on the four Fianna Fáil MEPs – Billy Kelleher, Barry Andrews, Barry Cowen and Cynthia Ní Mhurchú – all of whom have said they will not back her but belong to party that is in a Government which is supporting her. None responded to messages on Thursday evening. The stance taken by the MEPs – all announced they would not support her during the recent election campaign, reflecting her unpopularity in Ireland because of her outspoken support for Israel – is already the cause of some muttering among Fianna Fáilers back in Dublin. One source archly said: “Ah, it’s a secret ballot, though.” But the notion that the MEPs could oppose her in public while supporting her in private seems far-fetched, even by the standards of back-room hustling and side deals that inevitably govern EU horse-trading. Right now, von der Leyen is the supplicant, seeking the approval of the heads of government and then the votes of the MEPs in the parliament. But if – as expected – she is approved by both bodies, then the tables will be turned. The governments will become supplicants to her court, seeking influential commission portfolios for their nominees. This is where there are a couple of sticky points for the Irish Government. Taoiseach Simon Harris reiterated on Thursday he would not (as von der Leyen is expected to request) nominate a woman as well as McGrath. Combined with the lack of support from Fianna Fáil MEPs in what could be a tight election, and von der Leyen may not have Ireland at the top her list for preferential commission appointments. McGrath may yet face an uphill battle to secure his big job in Brussels.",0,1
2024/6/27,"Ireland will not provide second EU commissioner candidate  if requested for gender balance, says Harris Taoiseach ‘taking every opportunity’ over coming days and weeks to lobby for high profile commission brief for country Ireland does not plan to nominate a second candidate, alongside former minister for finance Michael McGrath, for its next European Commissioner role, regardless of whether a gender balance of two names is requested as expected, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. National leaders of the 27 EU countries are holding a key summit in Brussels, where Ursula von der Leyen last night won their support for a second term as European Commission president.  Speaking on his way into the meeting on Thursday, Mr Harris said there was a “clear consensus” that leaders would be backing Ms von der Leyen, following which she will need to be confirmed by a majority of MEPs in the European Parliament. If Ms von der Leyen is successful in that parliament vote in July, she is likely to then request at least two names, a man and a woman, from each country as nominees for their next EU commissioner, to try to achieve a gender balance of appointments in what would effectively be her commission cabinet. The allocation of commissioner jobs will likely take place in the weeks after the vote in parliament, if Ms von der Leyen is successful. Mr Harris said Ireland would not be sending two names, but sticking with Mr McGrath as their sole nominee. The Fine Gael leader said he did not believe sending only one name would hurt Ireland’s chances of landing a strong commission portfolio. “I’m aware president von der Leyen may seek the name of a man and a woman. Ireland has done that in the past, on occasions Ireland has sent one name, on occasions Ireland has sent more than one name. On this occasion, and respectfully in accordance with the treaties, we have taken the decision to send one name,” he said. Ireland is seeking a finance-related commission portfolio, but is likely to face competition from several other EU countries. The plan to put forward a single name for the next Irish commissioner could lead to a clash between the Government and Ms von der Leyen’s team, if she secures another five year term. Mr Harris said there was an “advantage” in being one of the first countries to publicly name their intended nominee. “I think it is a symbol of intent in how serious we take the European Union that we would send one of our most senior politicians,” he said. Mr Harris said he would be “taking every opportunity” over the coming days and weeks to lobby for a high profile commission brief for Ireland. The EU treaties were clear that the pick of who to nominate for each countries’ EU commissioner was a decision for national government, he said. “Our position from an Irish point of view on the name of Ireland’s commissioner is settled,” Mr Harris said.",0,1
2024/6/28,"Fianna Fáil MEPs will ‘reflect’ ahead of vote on Ursula von der Leyen Micheál Martin says four MEPS will engage with European colleagues ahead of a vote on whether or not von der Leyen should return as European Commission president  Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs will “reflect” as well as engage with European colleagues ahead of a vote on whether or not Ursula von der Leyen should return as European Commission president, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has suggested. The Irish Government is backing Ms von der Leyen to return as commission president. However, awkwardly for the Coalition Fianna Fáil’s MEPs Barry Andrews, Barry Cowen, Billy Kelleher and Cynthia Ní Mhurchú all said during the European Election campaign that they would not vote for Ms von der Leyen should they get elected to the European Parliament. This came amid concern over her support for Israel – widely seen as unqualified – in the immediate aftermath of the October 7th Hamas attacks. Mr Martin was asked on Friday if he was concerned that the four MEPs’ public statements that they would vote against Ms von der Leyen would lead to a less senior or less desirable role for former finance minister Michael McGrath in the next commission. The Fianna Fáil leader said: “Well the vote hasn’t happened yet and two things have happened since the election of substance.” He said that the first was that “an agreement has been reached between the EPP [European People’s Party] and the Socialist group and the Renew/Alde group, of which Fianna Fáil are members, and that agreement means that Ursula von der Leyen has emerged as the unanimous choice of the EU Council”. He said the second was that Mr McGrath has been nominated by the Government to be Ireland’s commissioner. Mr Martin said there were issues that arose during the election campaign. “I feel that our MEPs will reflect on this and will perhaps engage on some of the issues and will talk to their broader party within Europe. And so it’s some distance yet before there will be a vote. So I think there will be some reflection and some engagement.” Asked if he expects the MEPs to publicly say they will back Ms von der Leyen in the European Parliament vote, he replied: “I respect their positions and, as I said, there will be engagement.” None of Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs responded to attempts to contact them on Friday.",0,1
2024/6/29,"Fianna Fáil TDs rack up the air miles after recall from China junket Party had not cleared deputies for take-off, but James O’Connor flew straight back to Beijing after casting Dáil vote James O’Connor, the Fianna Fáil backbencher for Cork East who was recalled home from China to vote in the Dáil on Wednesday, has returned to Beijing to complete his junket to the Far East. “He’s spent more time in the air this week than some of those Aer Lingus pilots,” remarked one Fianna Fáil deputy upon hearing the news of O’Connor’s quick turnaround. He flew out last Friday to the Chinese capital with party colleagues Pádraig O’Sullivan, the TD for Cork North-Central, and Louth-based Senator Erin McGreehan. However, with two crucial votes set to take place the following week, party leader Micheál Martin contacted the two TDs on Monday night and ordered them back to base. The party did not clear the two travellers for take-off, although we understand they told colleagues they had independently arranged voting pairs for themselves. A pairing arrangement is when an opposition TD agrees to facilitate the absence of a government TD by not voting, thus cancelling each other out. The two Cork deputies were rather peeved at having to fly halfway around the world to be present for the Dáil votes. Their disgruntlement was noted by “sympathetic” colleagues in the Members’ Bar who found the incident highly entertaining. The fact that the three Fianna Fáilers had been away came as a surprise to many in the party, who heard nothing about trips to China and were rather put out by this. They presumed it was arranged by the Ireland-China Parliamentary Friendship Group (there are 48 such groups in the Oireachtas) as O’Connor is its convener. He was one of three members of the group who officially visited China in September when Zheng Jianbang, vice-chairperson of the standing committee of China’s National People’s Congress, met them at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The other two were Barry Cowen, now Fianna Fáil’s new MEP in Midlands North West, and Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh. Journalist Ken Foxe reported last month that the friendship group’s September trip to China was the most expensive trip undertaken by TDs and Senators last year, coming in at over €20,000. The flights cost €17,000 and the accommodation bill came in at €3,171 with smaller sums paid for subsistence and miscellaneous items. However, this latest excursion is not a Friendship Group trip and was neither arranged nor funded by Leinster House, where it is presumed that the Chinese are footing the bill. The FF Three are not representing their party either – a spokesperson indicated on Friday that it wasn’t informed of their plans. The Irish Times was unable to contact any of the three intrepid politicians on Friday although some colleagues said O’Sullivan did not fly back to China. But “Baby of the Dáil” James O’Connor, the youngest TD in Leinster House, was back on another flight to Beijing in no time. “At this rate the lad’s carbon footprint will be longer than the Great Wall of China,” marvelled a fascinated colleague. The Ireland-China Parliamentary Friendship Group is not to be confused with the Irish wing of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which highlights human rights abuses by the Chinese Communist Party and is co-chaired by Senators Barry Ward and Malcolm Byrne. Dáil proceedings had to be suspended on Wednesday morning when Fianna Fáil Senator Mark Daly interrupted his party leader Micheál Martin during Questions on Foreign Affairs, and several efforts had to be made to remove him from the chamber. It happened during a robust exchange between Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy and the Tánaiste over the proposed reappointment of Ursula von der Leyen as European Commission president. Just as the Fianna Fáil leader was rejecting Carthy’s charge that if the Government backed her it would “ignore the fact that she gave a green light to genocide”, a disembodied voice boomed out around the Dáil chamber. Micheál was stopped in his tracks. So was Matt, along with the small handful of TDs present. They craned their necks and swivelled their heads. The quizzical expression on Micheál’s face was a joy to behold, for it was, unmistakably, the voice of Senator Daly, a former cathaoirleach of the Seanad. One of the monitors positioned around the back of the chamber is permanently tuned into the Seanad – only picture, no sound. Minister of State Sean Fleming turned to the Tánaiste and said: “I’d say that’s the first time you’ve been usurped in the Dáil by a Senator.” Matt Carthy told him: “I bet that’s not the first time that particular Senator has disrupted you.” Micheál had sacked the Kerry politician as his party’s deputy Seanad leader and spokesperson for foreign affairs after he took part in an unsanctioned launch for a Fianna Fáil election candidate in Northern Ireland in 2018. Seán told us what happened: “It took a minute for people to cop on to where the sound was coming from – up in the far corner opposite the Government benches. One of the ushers rushed to get the remote control and ran up the steps to mute it. But nothing happened. “Then another usher arrived with a chair and he stood on it to try and push the ‘off’ button but he couldn’t find any buttons. “So the next thing was to send for an electrician, but it would be at least five minutes before he arrived and as we couldn’t talk because Mark was so loud the Leas-Cheann Comhairle suspended the House.” The electrician eventually arrived with a different remote. He put Mark off and everyone else out of their misery. Wouldn’t be surprised if Micheál is still having nightmares about it. If Fine Gael can have the youngest-ever Taoiseach then Fianna Fáil can have the youngest-ever Minister for Finance. To celebrate the elevation of Jack Chambers (33½) to Minister of Finance, the party released a 13-second video featuring a delighted Micheál Martin showing how he is down with the kids by shaking hands in his office with Chambers of Commerce, who so doesn’t care that he isn’t even wearing a tie with his edgy navy suit. That’s the young people for ya. The video shows JC 33 in a suit and shaking hands with the President before striding in slow-mo down the ministerial corridor wearing nothing but a navy suit, white shirt and tie. Then the action cuts to Jack, minus his jacket and tie, executing a basketball shot and the cringefest finishes with him posing with his seal of office in the garden of Áras an Uachtaráin, like he’s made his confirmation. But best of all is the soundtrack featuring the viral tune Man in Finance by Megan Boni. She repeats “I’m looking for a man in finance, trust fund, 6ft 5in, blue eyes ...” We fear poor Megan is barking up the wrong tree here. In January, the Minister announced on social media that he is gay. We hope Fianna Fáil’s people didn’t steal the finance man idea from the young people in the Green Party, who used it weeks ago in an election video for Grace O’Sullivan. Unfortunately, she lost her seat. TDs and Senators received a desperate cri de coeur from Fianna Fáil backbencher Robert Troy on Thursday morning. “Colleagues, Unfortunately, having secure (sic) two tickets for Andrea Bocelli open air concert in his hometown of Tuscany, Italy, I now can’t go. Concert is on Friday 19th July and tickets are €180 each. Let me know if interested. Best, Robert.” The Longford-Westmeath TD’s message went out to all Oireachtas members and very many of them immediately forwarded it to us. The concert sounds lovely. It will be in the open-air Teatro del Silenzio (Theatre of Silence, a novelty for any member of Dáil Éireann) in the town of Lajatico near Pisa. There were some replies to Robert’s email, though no takers that we know of yet. Independent TD Thomas Pringle responded: “Is that Tuscany, Co Westmeath or Longford?” Fine Gael Senator from Cavan Joe O’Reilly couldn’t oblige either. He wrote “Great follow up question, Thomas. I’m afraid I’m from Big Tom country.” And some politicians might even have been humming one of Andrea Bocelli’s greatest hits in Robert’s vicinity. “Time to ... say goodbye ...” On Wednesday, Senator Rónán Mullen had a lot to say during the remaining stages of the landmark Bill on surrogacy and assisted human reproduction. He would be talking still if it hadn’t been guillotined. “On this issue of surrogacy, the mainstream media in this country has been the dog that has not barked, and it has failed, largely speaking, to shine a light on the Government’s bizarre, cruel and perverse proposals such as the ones I have just described. The reason for that is simple. It is always easier to focus on real-life human interest stories and we have celebrities who have obtained children through celibacy,” he declared, before realising his slip of the tongue. “Celibacy? Celibacy? Good lord,” he exclaimed. “Surrogacy!” he shouted with a laugh. Fine Gael’s Mary Seery Kearney interjected: “They are allowed have children as well.” Rónán chuckled: “But of course, it does allow it, actually, through celibacy, now that you mention it. But you have this bizarre situation where high-profile people have been able and enabled to have children through surrogacy.” Celibate dads, says Rónán. To paraphrase that famous line from Father Ted: “I hear you’re a surrogate father now, Father.” The Leinster House OWLs were honoured this week by Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl at a graduation ceremony in the LH 2000 complex. Seven graduates completed the 2022-2024 Oireachtas Work Learning (OWL) programme, which is an applied learning, development and socialisation scheme for young adults with an intellectual disability. The Houses of the Oireachtas is the first parliament in the world to host an initiative of this kind. The graduates in this year’s programme were placed across different offices in Leinster House and in various Government departments including Finance, Agriculture and Tourism, where they gained valuable work experience in multiple areas. The Ceann, who launched the award-winning programme in 2018, told the Super Seven and their friends, families and workmates that one of the key values of the Houses of the Oireachtas is to be inclusive. “I hope you will be happy and fulfilled as you go forward in your new roles in employment and in further education. I wish every one of you the success you clearly deserve.” Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh introduced his wonderfully titled Arts (Recognition of Comedy) Bill in the Dáil on Thursday. It’s no laughing matter, he told the House. The art of comedy has been recognised since the ancient Greeks, and comedians should be recognised for State funding along with other members of the arts community. “We could say this is no laughing matter and make various puns. We have all watched and listened to comedians and enjoyed it. When times are dark, sometimes that’s the best form of medicine. However, unless we are willing to give them their proper due, respect and access to funding, it just makes it more difficult, especially for up-and-coming artists, to do it.” Funnily enough, TDs and Senators who have offices in the Leinster House 2000 annex were taken aback on Wednesday when they saw a clown in full costume making his way through the building to the Fine Gael offices. It turns out he was hired by Senator Mary Seery Kearney to entertain the children who came to Leinster House with their parents for a photocall on the surrogacy Bill. Mary shouldn’t have wasted her money employing a clown. Plenty of them around Leinster House who would have done the job for free.",0,1
2024/6/3,"War of words erupts between Coalition partners Fine Gael and Green Party on election trail Tense exchange between Dublin MEP candidates Regina Doherty and Ciarán Cuffe over climate actions A war of words has erupted between Fine Gael and the Green Party as the Coalition partners face off with just days to go before the local and European elections. Fine Gael MEP candidate in Dublin Regina Doherty accused the Green Party of “arrogance”, “talking down” to voters and having “an autocratic style” of Government. Green Party Dublin MEP candidate Ciarán Cuffe then accused Fine Gael of unleashing “climate chaos” and of “scaremongering”. In her original comments to the Irish Daily Mail, Ms Doherty said the Green Party “are doing more harm than good to the climate change agenda.” “Their autocratic style of government means they talk down to people when they should consult with them. They have lost the political dressingroom, even when it comes to those of us – the majority of the people – who responsibly support the need for climate change.” Speaking about traffic plans for Dublin and of what she sees as a “spaghetti junction” of cycle lanes, she said “the arrogance of the Greens is impacting on businesses and people’s quality of life. Even Guinness trucks and builders’ lorries can’t get into the city.” Mr Cuffe hit back while out canvassing in Dublin on Monday, and said her comments are “just a flavour of the lengths that her party and their EPP colleagues will go to unleash climate chaos on Europe.” He said that Fine Gael is “hell-bent on dismantling hard-fought protections designed to keep people safe and secure in their homes. ” “Unfortunately, we have come to expect this from Fine Gael and EPP. Time and time again, they have gotten into bed with Europe’s far-right to tank green laws designed to keep people safe in their homes, safe on our streets. They make no secrets about their agenda of inaction either, going as far to publish a kill-list of EU laws. People should be aware of the choice they face when they’re voting this Friday: climate chaos with Fine Gael or a liveable, safe future with the Greens.” “Fine Gael do not take the threat of climate change seriously nor are they ready to live up to their responsibility to protect the Irish people from its catastrophic effects. Taoiseach Simon Harris’ failure to even discuss climate change during his Convention speech or in his speech to the National Economic Dialogue is symptomatic of a wider party inertia that you’d sooner expect from the Tories.” “We have to fight back against Fine Gael’s scaremongering, or Ireland will be left behind.” The most recent Irish Times Ipsos B &  poll for Dublin placed Regina Doherty at 12 per cent, and Ciarán Cuffe at 8 per cent. Meanwhile Fine Gael sources have said they believe the party can take two seats in the Midlands North West constituency between Maria Walsh and Nina Carberry. The party conducted polling over the weekend which it believes shows strong transfers between Ms Walsh and Ms Carberry. “It is still all to play for. We know that Nina is the most transfer friendly candidate in the field,” a party source said. All candidates in Midlands North West will also this week be sent empty milk cartons by Lakeland Dairies, with a message asking them never to allow anyone in Europe to imagine a rural Ireland without milk production. “Our industry is worried that unless we are supported over the next five years there could be a lot more empty milk cartons and fewer farmers by the time of the next election,” said chairperson Niall Matthews.",0,1
2024/6/30,"Green Party leadership candidates speak of ‘image problem’ and going on ‘election footing’ Final leadership hustings are held as Roderic O’Gorman and Pippa Hackett face off The Green Party must get on an “election footing” and overcome an “image problem” surrounding the party, the two leadership candidates have said. The final leadership hustings was held on Sunday, with Minister for Children and Integration Roderic O’Gorman facing off against Minister of State for Agriculture Pippa Hackett, after Eamon Ryan announced that he would stand down. Both candidates used the occasion to issue a rallying call to members ahead of a potential general election towards the end of 2024. It comes after it emerged that Fine Gael has set a deadline of September 22nd for the completion of all candidate selection conventions, fuelling further speculation of a late October or mid-November election. “With the conclusion of the local and European elections, the Fine Gael Executive Council has requested that all Fine Gael Dáil selection conventions take place by September 22nd,” a spokesperson said. “This is to ensure that new candidates have ample opportunity to prepare, receive training and build profile in advance of the general election which is due on or before March 22nd, 2025.” Speaking at the hustings, Mr O’Gorman said if the Greens “are to win seats, in order to allow us to implement our policy, we have to be engaged with the issues the electorate bring to us. We have to get ready for that fight. We have to put our party on an election footing.” He wants to see the party use more data including through focus groups and polling ”so we can shape and target our message”, he said. “Getting ready for that campaign also means getting our candidates and getting our members ready. Before any election takes place we have to deliver in these last months of Government.” Meanwhile, Ms Hackett warned the party needs to address its “image problem” after “hurting people” by “implying they lead bad lives”. “Out of touch, preachy, judgmental, Dublin-centric, disconnected. These are some of the words that I have heard repeatedly in recent months about the Green Party. And these are not the words from right or left wing extremists. These are the words from ordinary, everyday people across this country. “Despite the excellent characteristics and commitment from the candidates up and down the country, many people couldn’t see beyond the logo and the name, and so many of our election candidates didn’t stand a chance,” she said. “We have created an image problem and I think anyone watching who thinks otherwise is deluded. And, yes, while many of the tropes that are out there are misinformation, they are unjustified, they are a very lazy characterisation of who we are and what we’re about. But the fact is they’re out there, and we have to oust them. “Simply dismissing these negative impressions with an eye roll will not dispel them. In fact it will only harden them. We’ve hurt people by implying they lead bad lives by burning turf, by using their car, by eating meat, by taking a flight or by being a certain type of farmer. This has to stop. “We have to get back to the people and understand their specific worries and concerns. Because if we don’t solve that fundamental problem then we are not going to have a party worth negotiating with, never mind what political groupings we may wish to join.” She also said she believes the Green Party “needs to focus more on people and less on policy”. “The policies are there. Now we have to make them work for people because not everyone is seeing or feeling their benefits. Relatability is key for the Green Party in the future.” The new leader of the Green Party will be announced on Monday July 8th.",0,1
2024/6/4,"Aontú calls for new border agency to oversee Ireland’s migration system Peader Tóibín says candidates will be ‘competitive’ in 24 local electoral areas Aontú will campaign for a new border agency staffed by thousands of people to oversee Ireland’s migration system if its members are elected in the upcoming local and European elections. The party, founded by Meath West TD Peadar Tóibín, launched its local and European elections manifesto on Tuesday, highlighting the themes of migration, State overspending and defence policy. The party is running candidates in the three European constituencies, including Mr Tóibín in Midlands North West. It is also running 66 candidates in the local elections. Mr Tóibín said he was loath to make predictions but said that the party would be competitive in at least 24 local election areas. On immigration Mr Tóibín claimed Aontú was the first party to have raised what he described as “large problems” in the Government approach through hundreds of parliamentary questions. He accused the Government of “breathtaking incompetence” in dealing with the issue. He said the party opposed the EU Asylum and Migration Pact, would establish a border agency to deal with all immigration matters, and have special courts to ensure that applications were dealt with within 12 weeks. Mr Tóibín said the party would also campaign for an Irish Sea border at the airports and ferry ports in Northern Ireland. He said that a recent poll in the Belfast Telegraph showed there was support for such a change in the North. “Anyone purposely destroying travel documents should not enter the State. All those who receive a deportation order should be deported, except in rare instances on humanitarian grounds,” the manifesto says. He said the party wanted a single border agency which would recruit “thousands more staff” that would act as a one-stop shop for migration, border policy, deportations, accommodation and enforcement. At a press conference in Dublin, attend by the other two European election candidates Aisling Considine (Dublin) and Patrick Murphy (South) as well as local election candidates, Mr Tóibin said Aontú had “common sense” policies that derived from listening to people rather that the “political cartel and metropolitan elite that is making decisions oblivious to the needs of the people”. He cited the €2.25 billion price tag for the National Children’s Hospital as an example of lack of accountability, as well as the €300 million spent on Metro North “and not a shovel has been put in the ground”. On military neutrality Mr Tóibín said the party would oppose any change in the triple lock, oppose any move toward an EU military alliance, and would oppose Ursula von der Leyen’s reelection as president of the EU Commission.",0,1
2024/6/4,"Canvassing in local elections is ‘intimidating’ and ‘demoralising’, says FG migrant candidate Supriya Singh says she has faced racial abuse, vandalism and harassment on north Dublin campaign trail in recent weeks Canvassing for migrant candidates in the upcoming local elections has become “intimidating” and “demoralising”, a north Dublin Fine Gael candidate has said. Supriya Singh, who is running in Donaghmede, says the racial abuse, vandalism and harassment she has experienced in recent weeks is “upsetting and disheartening” and totally contrasts with the Ireland she “fell in love with” eight years ago. A former TV producer and journalist from New Delhi in India, Ms Singh and her family lived in London for five years before they moved to Ireland in 2016. She joined Fine Gael in 2021 and the following year started canvassing. Ms Singh says she “never faced intimidating behaviour” before this year, and even those who disagreed with her politics were polite and “never abused me”. However, in recent weeks, 20 of her posters have disappeared, another eight have been “defaced with racist comments”, and last week, she was verbally abused by a passerby while putting up a poster. “A woman started recording a video and hurling abuse at my campaign team. It was intimidating and demoralising.” Ms Singh and her husband were particularly worried their 11-year-old daughter would see the racial slurs smeared across images of her mother. Once they were taken down, the couple hid the posters in the car until the children were asleep before storing them at home. “My son is too young to understand, but my daughter would be scared. She has her whole life in advance of her, and these kinds of experiences can be very frightening. “I cried that day, overwhelmed by how someone could be so cruel and forget that we are normal human beings with a family. No one should ever have to go through such incidents in life.” Ms Singh has also experienced online harassment in local social media groups from a “fake profile” that has since been removed by administrators. “It’s all very stressful, I’ve never gone through these things before. People often say politics is not easy for women, and I now understand that now first hand.” Fine Gael’s director of elections, Damien English, recently warned that candidates with migrant backgrounds were experiencing chilling levels of threats and racism. However, a joint statement from all political parties condemning this behaviour is needed to tackle the problem, says Ms Singh. In the meantime, she feels bolstered by the “remarkably kind” people she has met on the door steps. “Ireland has been my home for the past eight years – it was the love and warmth of the Irish people that inspired me to become involved in the community and give back in any way I could. My reason for being here is to serve and I will continue to do so wholeheartedly, without giving up,” she said.",0,1
2024/6/5,"Fianna Fáil forced to clarify position on EU farming derogation after Barry Andrews comments MEP ‘clearly said he does not support the continuation’ of nitrates derogation, says IFA president Fianna Fáil has been forced to clarify the party’s position on a key European Union (EU) farming derogation following comments made by the party’s Dublin MEP Barry Andrews on Tuesday evening. With the rural vote seen as crucial ahead of local and European elections on Friday, the comments also led to demands for clarity from Fianna Fáil’s Coalition partners in Fine Gael, while some in Mr Andrews’ party sought to distance themselves from them. In a statement on Wednesday, Irish Farmers Association (IFA) president Francie Gorman said that Mr Andrews “clearly said he does not support the continuation of the [nitrates] derogation” during a debate between Dublin MEP candidates on RTÉ on Tuesday evening. Mr Martin released a statement reaffirming that Fianna Fáil is “absolutely committed to applying for and securing a nitrates derogation at European level” and that the policy “is crystal clear in this regard”. Farmers fear that the ending of the derogation – after a midterm review last year which reduced Ireland’s headroom for exceeding EU rules on spreading organic nitrogen on farms – could force them to reduce herds. On Tuesday, asked about the Nature Restoration Law adopted by the European Parliament in February, Mr Andrews said he was against rolling back nature parts of the Common Agricultural Policy and added: “I don’t agree with continuing with the nitrates derogation, for example”. The IFA president said that this was “at odds with the position of the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue. Fianna Fáil must clarify their position immediately so that farmers know exactly what they are voting for on Friday.” With the rural vote crucial in European Parliament elections on Friday, Mr Andrews’ party colleague and Midlands-North-West MEP candidate Barry Cowen sought to distance himself from the remarks on Wednesday. In a statement on the X platform, Mr Cowen said his position and that of Fianna Fáil “is that we are committed to coninution the nitrates derogation. [Barry Andrews’] position is out of line with Fianna Fáil policy.” Fine Gael candidate for Ireland South, John Mullins, said on X that “the change of position from Fianna Fáil on this issue is deeply troubling and will sow chaos among our farmers who were rightly rattled by this flip-flop”. Mr Gorman said that it is “easy for Dublin-based MEPs to make rules for rural Ireland without any knowledge or experience of the implications of their decisions. Farmers will be annoyed and worried about what they heard last night and the Tánaiste must clear the matter up today.” Lisa Chambers, who is running in Midlands North West, said: “Party policy is to work to retain the nitrates derogation and if elected as an MEP I will do everything I can to ensure we retain the derogation for Irish farmers. The derogation is incredibly important for Irish farmers who work on a grass fed system, making us unique and in need of the special derogation.” The EU nitrates directive came into force with the aim of protecting waterways from agricultural pollution. Ireland applies to Europe for a derogation every four years, based on an argument about the Irish growing season and farming practices. This allows certain farms to exceed limits, allowing them to spread more organic nitrogen per hectare. After a midterm review, the European Commission lowered the maximum allowance for Ireland after negative findings about Irish rivers contained in a report by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). However, Ireland retains a higher limit than the rest of the EU as the derogation remains in place until 2027.",0,1
2024/6/5,"PAC chairman: close public contract ‘loopholes’ to reduce risk to taxpayer money ‘Major overhaul’ needed in how public bodies and government are signing off on contracts, says Brian Stanley The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman has called for “loopholes to be closed” to reduce risk to taxpayers’ money when public contracts are being signed.  Brian Stanley was responding to a question about the appointment of building firm BAM Ireland as the main contractor on the new €100 million Narrow Water Bridge in Co Louth that will connect Cornamucklagh near Omeath with Narrow Water near Warrenpoint, Co Down. BAM Ireland was strongly criticised in the Dáil last week by Tánaiste Micheál Martin over its involvement in the national children’s hospital. That project has been beset by delays and cost overruns with the first patients unlikely to be treated there until the autumn of next year at the earliest. BAM has rejected the claims made by Mr Martin. “It made me pause for a moment” Mr Stanley told Newstalk Breakfast in reference to the appointment of BAM Ireland on the Narrow Water Bridge project. “But I do think that all public bodies, local authorities, local councils and government departments need to be able to exercise a certain amount of discretion here with contracts.  “They do need to be done in a professional way, they need to be legally approved. The loopholes need to be closed. “We need to reduce the risk to the taxpayer. We need to get jobs coming in on time, projects completed. Because these hospitals and bridges and road services are all badly needed.”  Mr Stanley said it was important that the record of any company being considered for a public contract must be taken into consideration.  Any details in relation to persistent problems, delays, escalating costs, legal contest regarding claims “all need to be taken into consideration”.  Although some projects had been carried out on time and within budget, there were many other examples of public projects that were beset by persistent problems, he added. “I think what we need to do, in fairness, is we need a major overhaul of the actual terms of the contract. That’s what needs to happen here, where public bodies and government are signing off on contracts, that we need a major overhaul.  “We’ve seen the situation with various projects where costs continue to skyrocket. A lot of contracts don’t, and that’s welcome. We see where contractors are supposed to have a certain number of people on various sites. And public bodies and the taxpayer need to know that the public purse can be protected against that,” Mr Stanley said. “All governments now and in the future need to be sure about where the weaknesses are in the terms of the contracts. And I think what government need to do is say we have we have an Office of Government Procurement,” he said. “That office, I think, needs to engage in a major overhaul of how we do it. There are some legal constraints and, you know, legal minds need to be put to work on that to see how they can be tightened up, how loopholes can be closed, and how we can reduce the risk on the taxpayer.  “We can’t have a situation where we have open contracts and open-ended prices,” he said.  Rejecting the claims made by Mr Martin about the national children’s hospital, BAM said it is fully committed to the efficient completion of the project. “We have always fully resourced this project beyond the level required for the original programmed works – largely to cope with the high level of design change and disruption – and will continue to do so until the building is completed,” it said. BAM maintained the project was currently resourced “at 54 per cent above the anticipated levels for this stage”. The Irish Times reported last Friday that an independent conciliator had recommended that it should receive an additional payment of €107 million due to delays that could be attributed to the client. BAM Ireland executive director Alasdair Henderson said the company had a “proud legacy of delivering critical infrastructure across Ireland for over 60 years”. In reference to the Narrow Water Bridge, he said: “Using the most modern construction practices, this bridge will offer a safe, green route for cyclists and pedestrians, supporting our own vision of building a sustainable tomorrow.” BAM has built other significant projects in recent years including the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy bridge in Co Kilkenny.",0,1
2024/6/5,"Motorists could be able to have driving licence on smartphones by the end of the year Cabinet signs off on plans for digital wallet and ‘life events’ online portal Motorists could be able to have their driving licences on in a digital wallet on their smartphones by the end of the year under plans approved by Ministers. The Cabinet agreed to advance the development of the Government’s ‘Life Events’ programme which will include a single online portal for accessing services including birth and death registration and social welfare benefits. Ministers also signed off on plans for a new digital wallet that people will be able use for their driving licence as well as electronic versions of their European health insurance card and birth certificate. Minister of State for eGovernment Ossian Smyth said the paper or plastic cards or documents would not be obsolete but the new digital wallet would allow people to leave them safely at home. The digital wallet is being tested in its pilot phase. Mr Smyth says he has his driving licence on his phone as part of this and he is “fully expecting that it’s going to be live for the general public later this year”. He said that for it to be useful and functional the electronic driving licence would have to be acceptable to gardaí and “we’re working with the Attorney General on that just to make sure that any legislation that needs to be in place is there”. Mr Smyth said the current need to deal with various different Government departments during different life events such as getting married or divorced, buying or selling a car or moving home from living abroad can be a “huge headache”. He said the idea of the new portal – also due to go live later this year – is “to make those significant life events easy to manage and to reduce the time that’s involved in dealing with them”. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said the Government would use the data involved “responsibly and safely and will do so in a way that respects the rights clearly of all of our citizens.” He said it would be funded from the Public Service Innovation Fund which has as much as €15 million available and the Government believes the cost will be “well inside the money that’s available in that fund at the moment”.",0,1
2024/6/6,"Local elections: Fear and anger dominate mood in Tallaght South  Few of those in Fortunestown believe their vote could achieve change If housing, health and immigration are the dominant issues in Ireland’s least voting electoral area, fear and anger dominate the mood among voters, young and old, in Tallaght South. The South Dublin County Council district had the lowest turnout (29.9 per cent) in the 2019 local elections and includes some of the poorest areas in the State. Fettercairn, described as “very disadvantaged” by the independent agency Pobal in its analysis of census 2022 data, had the lowest turnout (26.9 per cent) in Tallaght South. The area faces acute social and economic challenges. As if to exemplify locals’ sense of abandonment their only shop closed in recent months leaving residents to walk up to 35 minutes to Springfield and Fortunestown. Few of those in Fortunestown believe their vote can achieve change. Most trust neither politicians to heed their concerns nor the mainstream media to reflect them. Aisling, who works in a local school and does not give her surname, “wouldn’t bother voting”. “I think the majority of people around here won’t vote. It doesn’t matter who gets in. It will be the same outcome and it won’t be for us,” she says. “The housing big time needs to change, and migration,” she adds when pressed on her concerns. “A lot of Irish people are homeless and the Government is putting foreigners before the Irish, to look good in front of Europe.” Her mother, Barbara, nods. “For me, safety is the biggest issue. I don’t feel Irish in my own country any more. I get on that Luas every morning and I am probably the only Irish person on it.” Ireland has “changed for the worst” and she is “very scared” by that. “My youngest son went to Australia two years ago and I tell him, ‘Don’t ever come back to live in this country, Ever.’ I am angry. I think we are losing the whole Ireland that we have always been known for. “Foreigners being here is not the issue,” she says. “It’s that so many are coming in, and so fast while Irish people are suffering, getting lost and not getting anything.” Asked where they turn for trusted information, Aisling says: “The mainstream media is massively leaving a lot out. A lot of crimes aren’t being reported [by media] because they don’t want people knowing what’s really going on. I trust the news real people put in their stories [on social media].” At nearby Fettercairn Community and Youth Centre, women senior citizens are having lunch. Asked their main election issues, Tess McCann answers first and without hesitation. “Housing and the refugees.” All say they will vote – as long as it’s not raining say some – describing it as their “civic duty”. Though housing, public transport and the health service are raised, immigration animates the women most. “The politicians are making an absolute mess of this... We couldn’t go to another country without a visa and pitch a tent on the beach,” says Ms McCann. It “annoys” her that asylum seekers are “only being put in working class areas” and she wants councillors to resist more being housed in Tallaght. One woman who has said little to this point says: “I know that not one person around this table is racist. But the Government are making us racist. People are terrified about the future, for their grandchildren. What future have they?” Several nod as she continues: “Why are they [Ukrainian families] getting accommodation when our families can’t get housing? We are not getting fairness. Crumlin, Marino, Ballyfermot were built when there was no money in the country. There seems to be plenty of money now, so why aren’t they building?” Asked if their concerns will change how they vote, Ms McCann answers first. “No. I think Simon Harris and Leo did a great job especially after Covid. They gave us double money and the help with electricity. We were very lucky... I vote Fine Gael and will definitely again.” Young mothers Rebecca Cooke and Rebekah Coady are also in the centre. Both have children with disabilities and both have either been, or almost been, homeless. Accessing appropriate school places and services is a “constant struggle”. Ms Cooke’s daughter (11) was diagnosed with dyspraxia two years ago and still awaits an assessment of needs – necessary to access key services. Ms Coady’s son (4) is non-verbal and has suspected severe autism but has yet to get a diagnosis. She can’t get a school place, speech and language therapy or occupational therapy for him. “I worry all the time, all the time about him.” In the context of their fears for the future the conversation turns to politicians, the media. And immigration. “I know a lot of people coming here need help. But take care of your own,” says Ms Coady. Many who voted Sinn Féin in the last elections feel disillusioned, she says. “[Sinn Féin] used to be very good but I don’t think so any more. I know a lot of people who were in Sinn Féin and have stepped down. I think a whole lot of people will vote different and a big chunk won’t vote at all.” They may vote for Adam Smyth, local community worker and Fianna Fáil candidate. “He’s great for what he is doing. You’d be voting for Adam though. Not Fianna Fáil,” says Ms Cooke. Debbie Lee-Byrne, centre manager, hopes June 7th will see an increase on the 2019 polling numbers, given the serious challenges facing Fettercairn. “People have real concerns about housing, healthcare, safety – historical issues that are only getting worse.” What people also see “are large numbers of people coming in and already strained resources getting more stretched... they are blaming immigration. They are genuinely afraid, really scared and worried.” Such fears “have to be taken seriously” and not dismissed as irrational, she adds. “People feel they aren’t being told what’s happening, who’s coming in and they aren’t being asked.” She and staff try to encourage discussions on voting, “to look at how the system works and if people are not happy, how they could change it”. More would be convinced the system worked if they were provided with “information, reassurance and those being backed up with supports and resources”, she adds. “At the moment this community doesn’t even have a shop”.",0,1
2024/6/7,"Banks warn of pressure to cut mortgage rates following ECB interest rate cut Close to 200,000 homeowners are set to benefit from the ECB rate cut of 0.25 percentage points immediately Bank representatives have warned against pressure on them to cut interest rates after Taoiseach Simon Harris sought a meeting to discuss mortgage interest rates and other consumer issues. Mr Harris’s request came ahead of yesterday’s ECB rate cut which is expected to be followed by further reductions later this year, following a long period of rate increases to tackle inflation. In a letter to the heads of the State’s main banks last week, Mr Harris said: “I expect interest rates to fall over the coming months. While I understand that interest rates are a commercial matter for your bank, just as mortgage holders on variable rates saw their monthly rates increase, I would like assurances from you that their monthly repayments will decline just as quickly.” Speaking to reporters earlier this week in anticipation of the rate cut, Mr Harris said it was “important that banks pass that [rate cuts] on as quickly as possible”. But the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, an industry group, responded to the rate cut by pointing out that “interest rates and pricing of lending is a commercial matter for each bank or non-bank lender that operates in the marketplace”. “In addition,” the group’s chief executive Brian Hayes, the former Fine Gael minister of state, said, “lenders are legally prohibited – under strict competition rules – from signalling any future pricing change either publicly or privately”. Sources pointed out that any statement suggesting that rate cuts would automatically be passed on would be in breach of rules. The Minister for Finance Michael McGrath was cautious on the subject, telling RTÉ that “the pricing of mortgages is a commercial decision for the banks”. “I think what is important is that they treat customers fairly and consistently,” he said “Of course, they should be treating people fairly and where interest rates went up in line with the ECB changes, then they should fall as ECB interest rates come down. I think that is the key point.” Some Government officials were critical of the Taoiseach’s intervention: “It’s like something an opposition finance spokesperson would come out with,” said one, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Close to 200,000 homeowners are set to benefit from the ECB rate cut of 0.25 percentage points immediately with banks set to pass it on to tracker mortgage holders from the middle of this month. The reduction, which had been widely flagged, will result in monthly repayments on every €100,000 of tracker mortgage debt falling by around €13 so that a customer with €200,000 remaining over 10 or 15 years will save about €25 monthly. Industry analysts have warned the Frankfurt-based bank is likely to take a cautious approach to future rate cuts, a view borne out by ECB president Christine Lagarde in the wake of the move. “We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2 per cent medium-term target in a timely manner,” she said. “We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim.” Darragh Cassidy of price comparison and switching website bonkers.ie noted that as the cut in interest rates had been so well signalled over recent months, several mortgage lenders had already cut their fixed rate mortgage products in anticipation. “Those on variable rates may have to wait a bit longer to see anything positive though. The main banks only passed on a fraction of the ECB rate hikes to their variable-rate customers in the first place,” he said. “Mind you, variable rates in Ireland were very high to begin with. So, there may not be much movement from the banks here, at least initially.”",0,1
2024/6/9,"How did immigration-focused candidates fare in the elections? Those who criticised immigration policy will not control any councils but still marshalled thousands of first-preference votes Candidates who focused on immigration were unlikely to form a large part of local government after these elections but looked set to make some gains after the issue was put on the ballot paper as never before. While those who emphasised criticism of immigration policy above other issues will not control any councils and were often eclipsed by established parties, they still marshalled many thousands of first preference votes across the country, with several far-right or anti-immigration parties putting extensive lists of candidates before the electorate. Though many such candidates and parties fell flat, some remained in the hunt for seats as counts continued across the weekend, and there were also successes for those who had spoken at protests against refugee and asylum seeker accommodation or had outlined their opposition to the opening of centres. Malachy Steenson, the Independent candidate in Dublin’s North Inner City who was prominent in the first protests against migrant accommodation in the East Wall area, was elected to Dublin City Council on the 12th count on Sunday afternoon. He took 915 first preference votes, accounting for 8.9 per cent of the total. In the Ballymun-Finglas area, which also saw significant protests beginning in early 2023, Independent candidate Gavin Pepper polled 1,126 first preference votes to leave him in the running for a seat as counting continued on Sunday. After the eighth count, Mr Pepper was in third place in a six-seater, while the National Party’s Stephen Redmond took 930 first preferences in the same area. Both benefited from the distribution of anti-immigration Independent candidate Leon Bradley’s vote. Ross Lahive, who was prominent in protests against LGBTQ+ reading material at Cork City library, was in a battle with Sinn Féin and People Before Profit in Cork City North West, having taken 724 first preference votes. In Fermoy, the founder of Ireland First Derek Blighe, who was also running in the Ireland South MEP race, got 899 first preferences. Mr Blighe, who has been described in the Dáil as a far-right agitator, was eliminated on the sixth count. In Galway, Seamus Walsh, a former Fianna Fáil councillor who left the party after a row over an immigrant accommodation centre, was elected in Connemara North on the second count with 1,525 first preference votes, or 19.2 per cent of the total ballot. Philip Dwyer, the self-described citizen journalist who has travelled to multiple protests at accommodation centres around the country, polled poorly in Tallaght Central, taking 556 votes and was looking unlikely to be elected on Sunday. Stephen Kerr, who has criticised the level of immigration and is the founder of the online media outlet the Irish Inquiry, was not elected to Mayo County Council after taking 899 first preferences in Castlebar. Independent candidate John Snell, who had said plans to house international protection applicants in Newtownmountkennedy had left the local community feeling they were being steamrolled, was elected on the first count in Wicklow. Meanwhile, John Larkin, an Independent candidate who supported protests against the accommodation centre, was still in the hunt for a seat on Wicklow County Council on Sunday evening after outpolling both Sinn Féin candidates on first preference votes. At a European level, candidates who have criticised the Government on immigration issues were expected to be in the hunt for seats in all three European Parliament constituencies. Niall Boylan in Dublin and Ciarán Mullooly in Midlands North West for Independent Ireland, and Independent TD Michael McNamara in Ireland South were all expected to be in the reckoning as votes are counted in the coming days.",0,1
2024/7/1,"Children to be allowed in places where betting happens under exemptions to gambling law Legislation to be changed to exclude charitable and philanthropic organisations from advertising watershed New changes to the Government’s landmark gambling legislation will see children allowed on to some premises where betting takes place while ATMs will also now be permitted in certain circumstances. The Government also intends to introduce further exemptions for charitable and philanthropic groups from the planned gambling advertising watershed between 5.30am and 9pm. Minister of State in the Department of Justice James Browne previously announced an exemption from the watershed for charitable and philanthropic organisations where the prize did not exceed €10,000. However, a memo for Cabinet has detailed plans for a full exemption from the advertising watershed to allow “sufficient flexibility for philanthropic organisations such as the GAA, charities, and other not for profit organisations to advertise and fundraise. This would mean that these groups or organisations could advertise within those times even if the prize is over €10,000.” The Gambling Regulation Bill is before the Seanad. The memo also details planned changes around the ban on allowing children in areas where gambling is happening. “These amendments will allow for children to enter on to a larger campus, such as a racetrack from where betting is provided, but children will be precluded from participating in betting at all times. Without these amendments, children could not attend events at racetracks, etc, even on days where no betting activities were being offered, such as festivals, family events,” the memo says. Children will still be prohibited from entering a bookmakers’ premises and similar locations. The operator of the campus or racetrack will have to apply to the Gambling Regulatory Authority for a licence in order to have children present. The authority will have the power to impose sanctions for any breach, including the loss of a licence with the possibility of a criminal prosecution with penalties of an unlimited fine or up to eight years’ imprisonment. Further changes will also see ATMs allowed to operate in certain circumstances. The memo says the ban on allowing ATMs has “proved challenging for premises such as racetracks around the country”. “It is important to recognise various business models operated by licensees at campus-like facilities. It is not the intention of the Bill to trespass on the conduct of other legitimate business such as restaurants, corporate events, pro-shops, just by virtue of their proximity to the provision of gambling activity during sporting events.” The memo says many premises are located in “rural areas and away from cash-withdrawal facilities, when compared to the majority of in-person gambling premises and bookmaker shops, which are usually located in towns and relatively near to ATMs. In addition, a person may have a personal preference to withdraw cash to gamble, or to buy food or drink at a bar or restaurant. There may be a situation where their bank card might not work, or the internet has gone down and the terminals cannot accept payment via a debit card.” Under the new changes, the operator of the premises will now be able to apply to the Gambling Authority who will decide whether to permit ATMs depending on the purpose or location of the site. Further changes are also planned to the new national gambling exclusion register, which lets a person self-exclude from gambling. The memo says that a “bespoke IT system” would be “exceptionally expensive and challenging”. Instead of opting out to specific operators and activities, there will now be automatic self-exclusion from all online gambling licensees and all of their products for a minimum of six months. Instead of being automatically removed after six months, a person will now have to apply to be removed.",0,1
2024/7/10,"Simon Coveney profile: substantial figure who played a starring role in the Brexit wars The way he contested the leadership of Fine Gael with Leo Varadkar in 2017 won him many admirers Simon Coveney’s decision to retire from politics is not a surprise. But it deprives Fine Gael of a truly front-rank political figure, a household name whose work as minister for foreign affairs during the Brexit wars, though it did not yield the anticipated electoral dividend in 2020, garnered him much respect. As well as being a significant national player, Coveney was also a big presence in his party. Although Leo Varadkar had the leadership election all but sewn up with majority support from the party’s elected representatives in 2017, Coveney’s refusal to duck out of the contest and his insistence that the membership must have its say won him support and admirers, and he went on to beat Varadkar comfortably in the vote among the party’s grassroots members. The party’s electoral college system meant that Varadkar’s advantage was decisive – but Coveney’s support didn’t mean nothing, either. For Coveney, just 52 years old but with a quarter-century in front-line politics - half of that in cabinet - behind him, the news signals the end of a political career that although it did not achieve the highest office, made a substantial contribution to the welfare of party and country. His most significant period came as tánaiste and minister for foreign affairs as the Fine Gael-Independent minority government dealt with the fallout from Brexit in a series of increasingly tense negotiations. Ireland’s achievement of its ultimate objectives – the avoidance of a hard border on the island and the maintenance of Ireland’s full and unencumbered place in the European single market – owed much to Coveney and the team of diplomats that he led throughout the period. And though he had a reputation among journalists and officials for long-windedness, he was never less than in command of a brief that was at times comprised of a bewildering array of moving parts. During this period, as deputy leader of the party, he would have been the natural successor to Varadkar. With the agreement of the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil-Green coalition in 2020, however, he began to play a less important role in Government decision-making as the locus of power inevitably moved from the Coveney-Varadkar-Paschal Donohoe axis at the top of Fine Gael to the three Coalition party leaders. By the time he moved from his much-favoured Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Enterprise in late 2022, his name was less mentioned in discussions about the succession to Varadkar. Nonetheless, many were surprised that he did not contest the leadership after Varadkar’s shock decision to step down earlier this year. His decision to step back from his cabinet role then was a clear sign that his political career was winding down. He was first elected in a byelection in Cork South Central caused by the sudden death of his father Hugh in an accident in 1998. From a large family of high achievers (his brother Patrick was chief executive of Greencore for many years; his brother Rory a senior executive in RTÉ who left last year amid the controversy engulfing the station), Simon was the one who chose politics, leaving behind a career as an agricultural adviser and farm manager. He survived the cull of Fine Gael TDs in 2002, but moved to the European Parliament in 2004, winning a seat for Fine Gael in the South constituency. By 2007, however, he was back in the Dáil and on the party’s front bench. He was made minister for agriculture by Enda Kenny in 2011 when Fine Gael returned to government amid the devastation of the financial crash. He added the Defence portfolio in 2014. When Fine Gael – though much diminished – returned to government after the 2016 election, he was made minister for housing, as the first pains of the housing crisis began to bite. His response was “Rebuilding Ireland”, a strategy to address homelessness and increase home building. But although progress was made it was woefully inadequate given demographic pressures that were beginning to press hard. Within a year, though, he had moved on. When Kenny stepped down – pushed, but gently, by Varadkar and Coveney – the two standard-bearers of the new generation duked it out for the leadership. Varadkar won, but Coveney’s conduct and his victory among the grassroots of the party added to his stature. He was made minister for foreign affairs and tánaiste. It was in this role that he was probably happiest, and in which he made his greatest contribution.",0,1
2024/7/10,"Simon Coveney: I was passionate about becoming taoiseach at one point Former tánaiste will not run for the Dáil again and is looking for ‘a change in direction’ after holding ‘virtually every office in the land except taoiseach’ Former tánaiste Simon Coveney, who has confirmed he will not run for the Dáil again, acknowledged that at one time in his political career he had been “passionate” about becoming taoiseach. “I have come to the view some time ago that it’s time for me to step out of politics at the next election, after the extraordinary privilege of serving this constituency for 26 years,” he wrote to Fine Gael members in his constituency of Cork South Central on Wednesday morning. Speaking on the Neil Prendeville Show on Cork radio station RedFM, Mr Coveney said: “At one point in my career, I really wanted to do that [be taoiseach]. I was passionate about what I could do as a taoiseach in Ireland. “But I’ve had extraordinary opportunities. I’ve had five or six different ministries in government. I’ve put my whole life into trying to be as good as I can be for the people that I’m responsible for serving. “For me I think now is the right time to change direction, to look for new challenges in life and to facilitate renewal in the political party that I’ve been working with and in for the last 26 years,” he said. Mr Coveney said he wanted to thank the people of Cork. adding it had been a privilege to serve Cork and Cork South Central for the past 26 years. “I’ve managed to do it as a as a county councillor, as a TD, as a minister, as an MEP, as tánaiste, and it’s an extraordinary privilege for somebody to get that faith the people have put in me, and I’ve worked as hard as I can to make people proud and to work hard for people in Cork through all of those years.” It had been incredibly rewarding, but also stressful, he added. “It’s demanding, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. When I stood for politics first, I made that decision at 25 after a tragedy in my family. I was very green, inexperienced. To be honest. I didn’t really know what I was getting myself in for,” Mr Coveney said. “I got elected initially on the back of a sympathy vote, I suspect, because my father had drowned tragically in Cork harbour, and I’m sure there was a lot of sympathy for the family on the back of that. But since then, I hope I’ve earned my place in politics, in the Dáil, and in the European Parliament and around the Cabinet table. And I have worked every day and every hour that I can to try to improve the lives of people in Cork and Ireland. “It’s a job that has resulted in me travelling all over the world as defence minister, as a foreign minister, as a trade minister, trying to learn from other countries so that we could apply better practice in Ireland. I look at my own career and of course, there are some things that I’d like to have seen happen faster. There are certain decisions that I struggled with. There’s certain mistakes that I’ve made. But by and large it’s been an incredibly rewarding career for me.” Mr Coveney said he had struggled with the abortion referendum, not because he disagreed with the proposition but because it was a very nuanced and personal decision for people to make. “That was a really difficult thing for me to settle a position on in terms of recommending how people should vote. And I remember really struggling with it because the position I took did influence other people. “You know, as a housing minister, I was impatient to make things happen a lot faster. And some of the things I just couldn’t get done as fast as I wanted, and some of the policies today that we see on housing were things I was asking the system for back eight years ago when I was a housing minister.” Mr Coveney said he had enjoyed “virtually every day” of his political career, but believed it was now time for a change in direction in his life. It was a decision that he had made, in consultation with his wife, he said, which was why he had indicated he did not have any interest in the leadership of Fine Gael when Leo Varadkar resigned. It was time to make way for new talent in the party and he was looking for new horizons, he said, adding: “I am excited about those.” Mr Coveney denied the family’s move from Carrigaline to Cobh had been an indication of his political change of heart. The move had been a family decision and his wife and children loved the move, which had been good for them, he said. “It’s probably the first time I’ve moved house without political considerations coming first. And, I felt I owed that to my family.” Mr Coveney also said he was not retiring from politics because he had been intimidated by the negativity and toxicity of social media. Politics had become more abrasive and aggressive but he had “lots of energy” and had many options available to him, “potentially” joining the private sector. “We’ll have to wait and see how that develops. For now, it’s really just, for the first time in 26 years in my working life, since I was 25, I’m actually looking outside of politics and what I might be able to contribute. “The important thing is that people remember me as somebody who was honest, I hope, as someone who worked incredibly hard for them. Somebody who was in politics for the right reasons. “I’m not somebody who goes after headlines or cheap shots. I don’t crave publicity. I’m someone who wants society to change and move in the right direction, who wants Ireland to be a positive, progressive, ambitious country that’s successful, that provides careers for young people as they grow up, that responds to social needs in terms of vulnerable people who need the intervention of government. I’m a big believer in that,” Mr Coveney said. “I’m not one of these people who believes in small government or right-wing politics. But I’m human as well, and I make mistakes. Not very many 52-year-olds can look back on a political career and say they’ve held virtually every office in the land except taoiseach.”",0,1
2024/7/10,"Simon Coveney confirms he will not contest next general election Former tánaiste announces decision to leave politics after more than 25 years Former tánaiste Simon Coveney has confirmed he will not run for the Dáil again. Mr Coveney wrote to Fine Gael members in his constituency of Cork South Central on Wednesday morning to break the news. “I have come to the view some time ago that it’s time for me to step out of politics at the next election, after the extraordinary privilege of serving this constituency for 26 years,” he wrote. In a copy of the letter to members posted on social media platform X, Mr Coveney said he had “loved almost every day of public life”, which was made possible “only because of the trust and generosity of the people of Cork South Central to whom I’ll be forever grateful”. The former minister for enterprise wrote he would not be leaving politics if he did not believe the future was bright. “Our party is strong and ambitious, our new leader has brought an energy that is reinvigorating the organisation at every level.” Speaking to reporters at Leinster House on Wednesday, Taoiseach Simon Harris said Mr Coveney was a close friend and he fully understood and respected his colleague’s decision. “He is a person who served his country well,” said Mr Harris, adding Mr Coveney had “made a real impact on Ireland”. The Taoiseach said he would always be remembered for protecting the national interest during Brexit, which he said had even been acknowledged by political foes of Mr Coveney. He said candidates were “lining up” to get on the Fine Gael ticket in Cork South Central, promising the party would be “very competitive” there and is “regenerating in real time”. Mr Coveney has held five Cabinet portfolios since being appointed as minister for agriculture by Enda Kenny when the Fine Gael-Labour coalition came to power in 2011. He was minister for housing between 2016 and 2017, before serving as minister for foreign affairs across two governments either side of the 2020 general election. He also served as minister for defence for two years, before being appointed minister for enterprise after Leo Varadkar took over as taoiseach from Micheál Martin in December 2022. In 2017, he contested the Fine Gael leadership with Leo Varadkar, losing out after the parliamentary party strongly backed his Dublin West rival, but winning the vote among the Fine Gael grassroots. He was appointed deputy leader of Fine Gael, only resigning that position after he stepped back from Cabinet when Simon Harris was elected. He was tánaiste under Leo Varadkar for three years, taking over when Frances Fitzgerald stepped down amid controversy following a series of policing scandals. Mr Coveney was most recently director of elections for Fine Gael’s European campaign, which saw the party retain four MEPs. He was first elected to the Dáil in a byelection that followed the death of his father, Hugh Coveney, in 1998. He was re-elected in 2002 and sat as an MEP from 2004 before being returned as a TD again in the 2007 general election. He was appointed to Cabinet by Enda Kenny. He was seen to have acquitted himself well during the horse meat controversy in 2013 and was to the fore of the Irish effort to handle the fallout from Brexit, taking a leading role on behalf of Ireland during negotiations between the European Union and the UK. However, his career was not without controversy: as housing minister, he initiated the Rebuilding Ireland plan that was inherited by his successor Eoghan Murphy and became emblematic of the Government’s inability to manage the housing crisis. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was embroiled in a scandal relating to the appointment of his former Cabinet colleague Katherine Zappone as a special envoy to the UN – an issue compounded by Ms Zappone hosting an event at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin that became a focus of attention over whether it complied with Covid regulations. Mr Coveney later admitted to deleting texts from his phone relating to the matter, which drew a backlash from coalition partners in Fianna Fáil and culminated in a motion of confidence against him, which he won, in September 2021. He was a close friend of Paul Hyde, the former deputy chair of An Bord Pleanála, who was given a suspended sentence and fined over his failure to declare interests in a number of properties when a member of the planning body. Mr Coveney hails from a storied Cork family. His brother Patrick Coveney is a former chief executive of Greencore, the publicly listed convenience food maker, while another brother, Rory, was until last year RTÉ's director of strategy before stepping down following a series of scandals at the station stemming from the emergence of secret payments to presenter Ryan Tubridy.",0,1
2024/7/10,"Simon Harris ‘happy’ for John McGahon to seek Fine Gael nomination despite court fine for assault and battery Taoiseach spoke as he marked the appointment of Nikki Bradley to the Seanad in place of Regina Doherty Taoiseach Simon Harris has said he is happy for Senator John McGahon to seek the Fine Gael nomination to run in Louth despite a court ordering him to pay €39,000 arising from a violent incident outside a pub. Mr McGahon was found not guilty in a criminal trail arising from the incident outside a pub in Dundalk in 2018, but Breen White, a farmer from Castleblaney, Co Monaghan, sued him in the High Court for assault and battery. Mr McGahon denied the claims and said he was assaulted and acted in self defence. The jury in the High Court case found that Mr White had been assaulted and awarded a total of €60,000 including €10,000 for aggravated damages. Mr Justice Alexander Owens gave a decree for €39,000 against Mr McGahon. “I’m happy for John to seek a nomination from the members of Louth Fine Gael,” Mr Harris said on Wednesday, but added that what happened was “unacceptable, is not acceptable to me”. He said he was nonetheless satisfied that Mr McGahon was remorseful and gave an undertaking that such an incident would not happen again. He said Mr McGahon had been found not guilty of a criminal offence and that it had occurred before his time in the Oireachtas. The Taoiseach characterised what occurred as a “scuffle” and emphasised that it was of key importance that he was found not guilty of criminal charges, describing it as “decisive”. Asked why there were seemingly no political consequences for Mr McGahon, Mr Harris said the political consequence will be that the members of Louth Fine Gael and – if selected, voters in Louth – would decide on Mr McGahon’s candidacy with all the facts to hand. “I also expect high standards here and I expect never to see a repeat of the incident,” he said. He said Mr McGahon had been an “extraordinarily hard-working member of Seanad Éireann” and as a young politician had made a positive contribution to politics. Mr Harris was speaking to mark the appointment of Nikki Bradley, a disability rights campaigner, to the Seanad in place of Regina Doherty, who has been elected to the European Parliament. He said he was an admirer of Ms Bradley’s work and was happy to be in a position to recognise that work and give a platform to her. Ms Bradley, a Donegal native, did not rule out running for the Dáil for Fine Gael in the future. She said the Seanad appointment was the “honour of her life” and she was “genuinely excited” to continue her work in the Seanad. She said her appointment sent a message to those with disabilities that anything was possible – especially to younger people. Mr Harris said Ms Bradley would have a major role to play nationally and noted that the Oireachtas delegation from Donegal is all male. He said that while matters for the general election were for another day, she would have his full support. Mr Harris said he wanted to see the delivery of a new disability strategy and the opting into the optional protocol of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, among other policy moves in the area of disability rights. He said it was important advocates with “real lived experience” such as Ms Bradley were given prominence.",0,1
2024/7/10,"Ministers asked to ramp up engagement with counterparts in new British government Taoiseach Simon Harris to meet UK prime minister Keir Starmer at Chequers next week in bid to improve relations Ministers have been asked to ramp up their engagements with their counterparts in the new British government, Taoiseach Simon Harris has told the last meeting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party before the Dáil summer recess. It comes as the Government hopes to improve relations with London now that a new Labour government is in power. Both Mr Harris and the new prime minister Keir Starmer have said there is an opportunity to “reset” relations between the UK and Ireland. There have been tensions in recent years amid the long-running Brexit saga as well as the former Conservative government’s controversial Legacy Act related to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. It was opposed by many victims groups in Northern Ireland and all the main Stormont parties and Labour has pledged to “repeal and replace” the Act. Mr Harris is due to meet Mr Starmer next week and the Taoiseach told his TDs and Senators that the talks and a working dinner will take place at Chequers, the prime minister’s country estate, rather than Downing Street. He said this would allow for a longer engagement. Mr Harris said Irish Ministers have been asked to increase their contacts with their British counterparts. The Fine Gael leader also told his party that Budget 2025 will “will put more money in people’s pockets and make work pay”. He said that following the Summer Economic Statement (SES) “there is no reason we can’t deliver a good budget this year with tax and welfare packages”. The SES, which was published on Tuesday, indicated that upcoming budget will be framed around a massive tax and spending package of €8.3 billion. This includes additional public spending of €6.9 billion and taxation measures amounting to €1.4 billion. On other topics, Mr Harris said he will have a meeting on school transport with relevant Ministers aimed at how to best manage school transport issues that arise every year. He confirmed that former Fine Gael TD Olwyn Enright has been appointed as the party’s director of organisation. Her role will include election planning, strategy, messaging and campaign planning. Newly appointed Senator Nikki Bradley was welcomed to the parliamentary party and contributors to the meeting praised former tánaiste and minister Simon Coveney, who confirmed on Wednesday that he will not be contesting the next general election. There were tributes and a moment’s silence for former TD John O’Mahony who died at the weekend.",0,1
2024/7/11,"Martin hopes for ‘friendly settlement’ in controversial Legacy Act dispute Tánaiste speaking in advance of first official meeting with newly appointed Northern Secretary Hilary Benn Tánaiste Micheál Martin has expressed optimism about future relations between the Dublin and London governments but cautioned about challenges ahead and “how we meet those challenges”. Mr Martin was speaking on Thursday evening in advance of his first official meeting with newly appointed Northern Secretary Hilary Benn at Hillsborough Castle following Labour’s landslide victory in the UK election last week. Addressing media outside the castle gates, he said he looked forward to discussing a wide range of issues, including the controversial Troubles Legacy Act, which Labour pledged to “repeal and replace” in its election manifesto. Mr Martin said he hoped the legacy issue would be dealt with “on an amicable basis”. “I expect we will explore that today without reaching any definitive conclusions,” he added. Asked whether the Irish Government would drop its interstate case it lodged in the European Court of Human Rights against the previous UK administration, he indicated that a resolution could potentially be reached. “There are mechanisms within the framework of the case which allow for, if you like, a friendly settlement but that will obviously depend on how the British government is going to deal with that Legacy Act and the core issues,” he replied. “Above all, we believe the pressing issue on legacy is to restore trust in the legacy framework for the victims and families of those who lost their lives in atrocities. It is about the families, the survivors and victims.” Despite tensions between Dublin and the former Conservative government over Brexit and legacy, Mr Martin acknowledged the “progress” made under former prime minister Rishi Sunak, and cited the Windsor Framework post-Brexit trade deal. Asked whether there was a change in tone with the accession of the new Labour administration, Mr Martin said he was “positive and optimistic about the future relationship between the British and Irish governments”. “But also I realise the challenges and I’m realistic in terms of how we meet those challenges, but what I am particularly focused on is to re-establish both governments working hand in hand as anchors of the Good Friday Agreement into the future. “I am positive and I believe there are opportunities here the British and Irish governments can exploit, and I am confident that if we work together we can advance reconciliation, which is my key agenda in the time ahead.” On the issue of the Casement Park redevelopment in west Belfast, the Tánaiste wouldn’t be drawn on whether the UK Government should match  the €50 million in funding provided by Dublin. “Over time, I think it’s important to have clarity on the costs and the target required to bring this to realisation in time for the Euro finals and then to work out the methodology to achieve that,” he said.",0,1
2024/7/12,"Michael D Higgins to consult Council of State over Bill relating to Defence Forces Legislation has passed all stages of the Oireachtas  President Michael D Higgins has convened a meeting of the Council of State to consider whether a new Bill relating to the Defence Forces should be referred to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. The council is to meet on Monday to examine the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2024, which has passed all stages of the Oireachtas and was referred to Mr Higgins for his consideration. Under Article 26 of the Constitution, the President may refer a Bill to the Supreme Court for a decision as to whether it, or any specified provisions, are unconstitutional. This is only the fourth time that Mr Higgins has convened the council to consider a piece of legislation during his time in office. He previously convened it in 2013 to consider the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013; in 2015 to consider the International Protection Bill 2015; and last year to consider the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2022. One of the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2024 would give effect to the Government’s decision to allow the military representative groups to associate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) and engage in some limited trade union-type activity. The Irish Times previously reported that military representatives have raised concerns about the legislation fearing provisions in the Bill would prevent them criticising government policy regarding recruitment and retention with the Defence Forces. A statement from Áras an Uachtaráin said Mr Higgins “intends to consult the Council of State in particular on Sections 11 and 24 of the Bill and whether the interference with constitutional rights is disproportionate”. Section 11 sets out restrictions on members of the Defence Forces making political comment, attending protests or participating in political activities such as canvassing. Section 24 sets out how Defence Forces association shall be independent of and not associated with any trade union or any other body outside the organisation. However, it includes a provision that the minister may authorise in writing an association with a trade union or any other body outside of the Defence Forces subject to “conditions or restrictions as he or she may specify”. In May, Tánaiste and Minister for Defence Micheál Martin addressed Defence Forces members representative body PDForra’s annual conference and outlined how the Government had engaged with it and another association, Raco, on their long-standing request to seek associate membership with Ictu. He said he was clear when taking the Bill though the Dáil that one purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the relationship between the representative bodies and Ictu and he said he was committed to that. Mr Martin said: “I understand that PDForra continue to have certain concerns in relation to language in the Bill around the conditions attached to Ictu association” and he hoped assurances he provided had dealt with the concerns. He also said “there is simply no questions of restricting the association’s right and capacity to advocate on behalf of its members’ interests”. The Council of State’s membership includes the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Chief Justice, the presidents of the Court of Appeal and the High Court, the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and the Attorney General. Other members include previous presidents, taoisigh and chief justices. The members of the council who were appointed by the President are environmental scientist Dr Cara Augustenborg; writer and disability activist Sinéad Burke; Irish Traveller human rights activist and sociologist Dr Sindy Joyce; chief executive of the Birmingham Irish Association Maurice Malone; Methodist minister and assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin, Johnston McMaster; senior lecturer at Maynooth University, Mary Murphy; and former journalist and Irish Language Commissioner Seán Ó Cuirreáin.",0,1
2024/7/12,"Five Fine Gael politicians compete for shot at Dáil seat vacated by Coveney Unsuccessful European Election candidate John Mullins pledges to move home to Cork South Central constituency if he is selected to run for the party At least five Fine Gael politicians will compete to secure a place on the party’s ticket in a bid to retain the Dáil seat that will be vacated by Simon Coveney. On Friday, Cork County councillor Úna McCarthy confirmed she has been nominated, joining European Election candidate John Mullins, Senator Jerry Buttimer and city councillors Shane O’Callaghan and Des Cahill in vying to become the party’s candidate. Mr Coveney wrote to Fine Gael members in his Cork South Central constituency on Wednesday to break the news that he will not run in the next general election. The former tánaiste and minister in several government departments, including Foreign Affairs, said it was “time for me to step out of politics at the next election after the extraordinary privilege of serving this constituency for 26 years”. He added that he had “loved almost every day of public life”, and said he was grateful to his constituents. Mr Coveney, who previously contested the Fine Gael leadership in 2017, ruled himself out as a successor Leo Varadkar when he resigned as taoiseach earlier this year. He also bowed out of consideration for a Cabinet role under new Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach Simon Harris. The Cork politician’s decision not to contest the next general election was widely expected. Mr Harris said Mr Coveney was a close friend, and he fully understood and respected his colleague’s decision. “He is a person who served his country well,” said Mr Harris, adding that Mr Coveney would always be remembered for protecting the national interest during Brexit. He said candidates were “lining up” to get on the Fine Gael ticket in Cork South Central, promising the party would be “very competitive” there. Fine Gael will hope to win as many as two seats in the newly-expanded five-seat constituency. A selection convention will be held on July 23rd, and it has not yet been confirmed how many candidates will be selected on the night. Carrigaline-based councillor Ms McCarthy said on Friday that is an honour to be nominated by a number of Fine Gael branches. With the other candidates city-based she said: “I truly believe that Cork South Central needs a Fine Gael candidate in the county to represent the communities in the lower harbour area.” Unsuccessful European election candidate Mr Mullins has been nominated to contest the convention. He currently lives elsewhere in Co Cork but has pledged to “immediately” move back to the constituency should be selected by Fine Gael members at the convention on July 23rd. On why he was seeking to run in Cork South Central rather than Cork East – where his current home is located – Mr Mullins highlighted his links to the area. He said his parents still live in Cork South Central and he grew up there, playing hurling and football with Bishopstown. The former Bord Gáis chief executive got almost 33,300 first preference votes in the European Election in the Ireland South constituency. He believes he “performed very well in the metropolitan Cork area”, adding “that’s the reason why I believe that I’m in a position to put myself forward as a candidate”. Former Cork South Central TD Mr Buttimer, currently the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, is also seeking a place on the Fine Gael ticket. Highlighting his 17 years as an Oireachtas member he said he had the experience and public profile to be a successful candidate in the upcoming general election. Cork City councillors Mr O’Callaghan and Mr Cahill have also been nominated to contest the selection convention. Mr O’Callaghan, a barrister who topped the poll in his area in the recent local elections, said he believed he was the “best placed” candidate to maintain a seat for Fine Gael in Cork South Central. Mr Cahill, who works in the pensions sector, said he was from the part of the city that has always delivered the highest vote for Fine Gael and he considered himself “well placed” to win a Dáil seat if he was selected. All five confirmed nominees praised Mr Coveney for his service as a TD and minister. Meanwhile, after Thursday the Dáil will not sit again for almost 10 weeks as the last summer recess before the next general election.",0,1
2024/7/13,"Simon Harris to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy at Shannon stopover following Nato summit Taoiseach will confirm Ireland has joined international coalition campaigning for return of  20,000 Ukrainian children from Russia and Belarus  The Taoiseach will confirm to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Saturday that Ireland has joined an international coalition pressing for the return of 20,000 children forcibly relocated from his country to Russia and Belarus since March 2022. Simon Harris will meet Mr Zelenskiy at Shannon Airport on Saturday afternoon for their first bilateral meeting on Irish soil, which will focus on Russia’s ongoing war of aggression and invasion of Ukraine. Mr Zelenskiy is making a stopover at Shannon   after attending a conference marking the 75th anniversary of Nato in Washington this week. US president Joe Biden introduced him as “President Putin” before quickly correcting himself during the event on Thursday. Mr Harris is expected to express his condolences to Mr Zelenskiy over a deadly attack on one of Ukraine’s largest children’s hospital earlier this week. Ukraine’s ongoing drive for EU membership will also be discussed, with Ireland among a large number of member states supporting accession. The Government confirmed it has joined the international coalition campaigning for the return to Ukraine of an estimated 20,000 children who were forcibly moved to Belarus and Russia and were made to enter what have been described as re-education programmes. Mr Harris and Mr Zelenskyy previously held a short meeting on the fringes of the Ukraine Peace Summit in Switzerland last month. Since 2020, Ireland has provided €250 million in non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine under the European Peace Facility. More than 108,000 Ukrainian refugees have also come to live in the State since the outbreak of the war.",0,1
2024/7/13,"100 days of Simon Harris as Taoiseach: Early starts, Enda Kenny influence and Coalition strains Since taking over as Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, Harris has kept up a frenetic pace which has re-energised the party, but some say he is too PR-focused  On Thursday next, July 18th, Simon Harris will complete 100 days as Taoiseach. He may already be halfway, or nearly halfway, through his (first?) term as Taoiseach. After another 100 days, on October 26th, he could be fighting an election campaign, if he does what everybody – friend and foe alike – expects him to do and calls an autumn general election. So while 100 days is hardly sufficient time to judge anyone on anything, it’ll have to do. And anyway, the mark of Harris’s career is that everything happens in a hurry. So, what’s the report card so far? He’s been busy, that’s for sure. Harris was unopposed for the Fine Gael leadership – something that reflected, among other things, the political weakness of the party at that time. He promised the party “a new energy” and he has been as good as his word; he has kept up an exhausting schedule. “He’s going to kill us,” complained an aide, not entirely in jest, during the local election campaign. A never-ending stream of press releases and comments pours forth from Government Buildings on all issues great and small. If you missed any of this, you can catch up on his various social media accounts; the TikTok Taoiseach has continued to tik and tok in high office and relay his deeds on Instagram. He rises early, around 5am, and prepares for the day before getting his two small children up and running. He usually arrives in the Taoiseach’s office between 7am and 7.30am. This is quite a culture shock to the staff who were used to a different regime. Typically, he is there until between 8pm and 9pm, though on Thursdays and Fridays there is an effort made to get him out and about, around the country as much as possible. He is careful to make sure one day at the weekend is free for family time – or at least as free as it possibly can be. He is never, after all, not the Taoiseach. A look at his official diary for a couple of random dates confirms the frenetic pace and also the extent to which the job of taoiseach, any taoiseach, requires immense physical and mental stamina. Monday, May 13th – by way of example – looked like this: 8.30am phone call with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese; 9am in Newstalk studio for an interview with presenter Pat Kenny; 10am meeting with then Green Party leader and Coalition colleague Eamon Ryan; 10.30am staff meeting; 10.30am meeting with secretary general of the Department of the Taoiseach John Callinan; 11.30am transfer to Áras an Uachtaráin for one of his regular “article 28″ meetings to keep President Michael D Higgins informed of matters domestic and international; 1.30pm back to Government Buildings; 2pm phone call with the Slovenian prime minister Robert Golob; 2.30pm meeting with Fine Gael general secretary John Carroll; 3.30pm briefing by officials before the Cabinet Committee on Children, Education and Disability. The leaders’ meeting with Ryan and Government colleague Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin started at 6.30pm and was due to finish at eight, but that rarely happens. Last Monday (July 8th), for example, the meeting didn’t finish until 10.30pm. And remember, for most of these meetings, the Taoiseach is the most important person in the room. He has to be on top of his game. Some of these meetings are for briefing and information purposes; others require decisions. And making decisions is the bread and butter of the Taoiseach’s job. Harris is said to be influenced by Enda Kenny’s example; the former taoiseach during his time in office advised his ministers to “keep making decisions”, noting that they wouldn’t always get it right but they had to keep moving on, making decisions, getting things done. He recently hosted Kenny in the Taoiseach’s office. The doctrine has limits, of course; in a coalition government you can only make decisions when you have agreement. Harris has yet to secure agreement on decisions such as the funding of national broadcaster RTÉ and the future of the hate crime Bill, which – though nobody mentions it now – he shepherded through the Dáil as acting minister for justice last year. There are “three or four” Cabinet committee meetings every week, one official says. They are slotted in for 90 minutes each, and the aim is to have three “decision points” from each meeting. Often, the role of the Taoiseach is to try to “break down silos”, using the power of the Taoiseach’s office to force co-operation between Government departments and agencies. He can be impatient and often requests meetings and briefing papers quickly – more quickly than some officials would like. Harris has not sought to give the Government a new strategic direction or new priorities. That would not be possible in a Coalition Government guided by a Programme for Government negotiated and agreed four years ago. But he has made a difference, both to the Government and – more dramatically – to his party. He was conscious of the need to build a relationship of trust with Martin (of whom he is an avowed admirer) and Ryan, and now Roderic O’Gorman, the newly appointed Green Party leader. But there are strains. Harris’s habit of commenting on and – as some of his partners in Government perceive it – claiming credit for everything the Coalition does irritates some of them. Fianna Fáilers are assembling a list of their achievements in Government they claim are being hijacked by Fine Gael. Frankly, that is all to be expected, and it will get worse as an election approaches. As Taoiseach, Harris will have to manage this aspect of the Coalition relationship a little better. In his party, though, Harris has transformed the mood. The task facing him when he became leader of his party (in March) and Taoiseach (in April) was to revive Fine Gael politically. That has been an obvious success. The change in the party’s outlook was almost immediate from his election as leader, and carried through to the successful local and European elections campaign in early June. Harris’s party approaches the coming election with a confidence that would have been unimaginable a few months ago. On some issues that have been points of note in the 100 days, such as the recognition of Palestine, Harris has taken up the ball that was passed to him and run with it. On others, such as his reaction to the sentencing of the soldier who attacked Natasha O’Brien on a Limerick street and the apology to the families of the 1981 Stardust fire, his capacity for projecting empathy – a necessary facility for any modern political leader – was fully on show. The criticism is often heard that he is too PR-focused. It is true that his advisers are mostly former journalists or public relations people, and Harris himself is both a natural communicator and acutely aware that communications is an indispensable part of politics. But it is not the only thing that matters; it is necessary, but not sufficient. The substance of long-term policy decisions – sometimes bearing fruit only in the years ahead – and the strategic direction of the Government is also the business of the Taoiseach’s office. Harris has not yet articulated a broader vision for the country or a worked-out plan about how to get there; and it is fair to say that he has not displayed an obvious hinterland. He has played the ball in front of him, and played it well, but he has not changed the game. It is also fair to say that these are early days – and that the Harris premiership (or at least the first instalment of it) is an accelerated, condensed experience for all concerned; there won’t be time for everything. Ultimately, he will be judged on the result of the next election. On day 100 that will look a lot more favourable than it did on day one.",0,1
2024/7/15,"Council of State meets to advise President on Bill bringing changes in Defence Forces  Members share their views on the constitutionality of the Defence (Amendment) Bill 2024 Twenty-two members of the Council of State attended Áras an Uachtaráin on Monday after President Michael D Higgins convened a meeting of the advisory body to hear views on whether or not he should refer the Defence (Amendment) Bill to the Supreme Court. The meeting of the Council of State was attended by Mr Higgins; Taoiseach Simon Harris; Chief Justice  Donal O’Donnell; President of the Court of Appeal Mr Justice George Birmingham; and President of the High Court Mr Justice David Barniville. Others present included Cathaoirleach of the Seanad Senator Jerry Buttimer; Attorney General Rossa Fanning, former presidents Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese; former taoisigh Bertie Ahern, Enda Kenny and Leo Varadkar; former chief justices Ronan Keane, Susan Denham and Frank Clarke; Dr Cara Augustenborg, Sinéad Burke, Dr Sindy Joyce, Maurice Malone, Dr Johnston McMaster, Dr Mary Murphy and Seán Ó Cuirreáin. Apologies were received from Tánaiste Mícheál Martin, Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl and former taoiseach Brian Cowen. The meeting began just before 3pm and finished a little after 5.30pm. Under Article 26 the President has a specific power to refer Bills to the highest court  to ask it to determine if a Bill (or its provisions) are in keeping with, or repugnant to, the Constitution. It was only the fourth time the President had convened a meeting to discuss a Bill during his 13 years in office. Previously the council considered the Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 and the International protection Bill 2015, as well as the Judicial Appointments Bill in November 2023. None has been referred to the Supreme Court. The Defence (Amendment) Bill 2024 will allow groups representing enlisted and commissioned personnel in the Defence Forces to associate for the first time with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on industrial relations matters. It also provides for an External Oversight Body for the Defence Forces, which is designed to drive cultural change in the military and increase transparency and accountability. The part that is thought to have raised a question in relation to its constitutionality was a provision contained in sections 11 and 24 of the Bill, which specifically bans Defence Forces members from commenting on a political matter “or matter of Government policy”. The format of Council of State meetings in the past has been that the President opens the meeting with a short address setting out the Bill and its provisions. The council does not vote or make any decisions but there is a “tour de table” during which members make their views known to the President. Following the meeting, it is the President who makes the decision on referring the Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. If it is found constitutional, once enacted, the law cannot be challenged in terms of its constitutionality.",0,1
2024/7/15,"Forensic accountants investigating allegations of ‘significant fraud’ by some hotels housing asylum seekers State has been winding up contracts with a range of accommodation providers on foot of a decline in the number of Ukrainians seeking protection here The Government has appointed forensic accountants amid concerns about “significant fraud” by some accommodation providers housing refugees and asylum seekers. The Irish Times has learned that Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman told a key Cabinet subcommittee last week that his department is concerned about “instances of significant fraud”, including cases hotels are believed to have claimed payments for people who have moved out of their accommodation. The State has been winding up contracts with a range of accommodation providers this year on foot of a decline in the number of Ukrainians seeking protection here, as well as many leaving hotels and guest houses. It is understood that approximately 75 contracts have already been terminated for compliance reasons. “Compliance issues identified include, but are not limited to, the health, safety and wellbeing of those in accommodation; overcharging by providers for accommodation; and unregulated secondary properties,” a spokesman for Mr O’Gorman said. “The department has contracted a forensic accountancy company to examine suspected cases of overcharging, and where identified the money owed will be pursued.” It is understood that any payments due will be pursued as a civil matter. Elsewhere, Ministers have been briefed on plans to ramp up the number of gardaí stationed in high-risk airports overseas in an effort to further drive down the number of people arriving with bogus documents or destroying their passports in transit. A briefing note circulated to Ministers in advance of a meeting of a Cabinet subcommittee dealing with immigration outlined that one airport liaison officer has been deployed in a high-risk airport since March of last year. Ministers were told the Department of Justice believes this has “resulted in a significant decreased in non-nationals who do not meet travel requirements from entering the State from the designated airport”. As a result plans are now under way to enhance the Garda National Immigration Bureau’s overseas network “into a number of European airport hubs in 2024”. The same meeting also saw an intervention from Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke, who appealed for more joined up thinking in the Government’s approach to a site in his Westmeath constituency. Refugees and asylum seekers are currently housed in tents and modular homes on the site of the former Columb Barracks in Athlone – with a plan to build 45 more modular homes for this year. However, Mr Burke is understood to have told Ministers that he had just attended a meeting discussing the development of the site as social and affordable housing by the Land Development Agency, arguing that the two decisions were incompatible with each other. He said Government risked compromising itself with a haphazard approach to projects. Ministers were told that applications to the International Protection Office were 120 per cent higher in the second quarter of the year than the same period in 2023. They were told 957 deportation orders were signed until the end of June, a 76 per cent increase on the same period last year, with 322 individuals removed from the State this year – 250 of whom were voluntarily returned. According to statistics given to Ministers, the number of undocumented arrivals at Dublin Airport in 2024 is down by 14 per cent compared to the first five months of 2023 and 42 per cent on 2022.",0,1
2024/7/15,"Tighter regulation of English language schools on way to sideline ‘rogue’ operators Annual fees and contributions mandated to  ‘learner protection fund’ to provide for students if schools fail English language schools will face a stricter regulatory regime and a range of fees for providers as part of a Government effort to crack down on “rogue” operators. Minister for Higher and Further Education Patrick O’Donovan is to brief Cabinet this week on plans for schools to be asked to pay up to €10,000 to receive a new quality mark for the international education sector, including English language schools. Obtaining the mark will also involve providers submitting to a close inspection of the courses they offer, and detailing their financial and corporate structure. There will also be annual fees and contributions mandated to a “learner protection fund” to provide for students if schools fail, as has happened in several high-profile instances in the past. While the new regime will not be mandatory, the Government is aiming to improve standards in the sector with the introduction from September of an International Education Mark (IEM) operated under a new “TrustEd” brand for international education providers who submit to the new arrangements. A new due diligence process for examining the capacity and capability of education providers and the learner protection fund will be put on a statutory basis. A new statutory quality mark was floated by former minister for higher education Simon Harris last year, with moves to underpin the sector with stronger regulation in gestation for several years. Fees and charges are likely to be tiered to reflect the size and scale of providers applying for the mark, with the fee for the due diligence process to be capped at €10,000. There will be exemptions for community and voluntary providers and reduced or waived fees will be possible in some instances. Annual fees are expected to come in at between €2,000 and €20,000. The interventions come amid long-standing frustrations within the Government at the quality of service offered by some operators in the industry. “We cannot have a situation where people say they’re providing a quality service and charge learners a load of money, but then are providing a substandard service,” said a Coalition source. “Unfortunately there are a few people operating in this space who take advantage of foreign nationals and charge them substantial fees, people from Bangladesh, Pakistan or India dealing with unprofessional or opportunistic providers,” the source added, saying formalising standards and giving recognition and verification to operators under the regime would give additional protections to students. Laura Harmon, executive director of the Irish Council for International Students, said she welcomed measures “to regulate the English language sector” adding it was “vital that rogue operators are clamped down upon”. She said school closures had left many students “out of pocket and put Ireland’s reputation as a study destination at risk”. She said her members had been calling for the introduction of the International Education Mark for more than a decade. “There must be a robust external monitoring, inspection and enforcement system to oversee the implementation of the IEM,” she added. The new industry standard will replace an interim list of eligible programmes currently operated and become the main tool for oversight of the student immigration system. It will be administered by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, the State agency charged with overseeing the quality and reputation of the further and higher education system.",0,1
2024/7/15,"Why is the President convening the Council of State? Q&A: Concerns expressed about Defence Bill which regulates Defence Forces’ representative associations On Saturday, President Michael D Higgins announced he is taking the unusual step of convening the Council of State over concerns about the constitutionality of a Bill regulating Defence Forces’ representative associations. What does the Bill do? The Defence (Amendment) Bill 2024 contains a number of important provisions regarding the Defence Forces, including for the first time allowing the groups representing enlisted and commissioned personnel to associate with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on industrial relations matters. It also established an External Oversight Body for the Defence Forces, which is designed to drive cultural change in the military and increase transparency and accountability. Those sound quite uncontroversial. Why has the President convened a Council of State? For the military representative groups, the main problem lies in Sections 11 and 24 of the Bill, specifically the parts which will ban Defence Forces members from commenting on a political matter “or matter of Government policy”. Surely it’s only right that soldiers stay out of politics? Few people disagree there. Members of the Defence Forces have always been prevented under law from commenting on political matters. For the representative associations, the problem with the new Bill is the part which prohibits them from commenting on “Government policy”. Representatives have called this a gagging order which will prevent them from taking public positions on issues such as pay, working conditions and retention, all of which are currently hot button issues in the military. What does the Government say? Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said there is no intention to stifle criticism from military representatives. This has done little to reassure the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (Raco) which previously accused the Department of Defence of “abusing a dominant position to attack the Defence Forces”. What are the other controversial parts of the Bill? Military representatives and opposition politicians have also criticised the make-up of the External Oversight Body as not being sufficiently independent due to the membership of the secretary general of the Department of Defence. Raco has previously said it will not co-operate with the body over this issue. Do people like any part of this Bill? One provision, which bans any other organisation from styling itself Óglaigh na hÉireann (the official name of the Defence Forces), seems to have been welcomed in most quarters. It introduces a fine for any person or organisation styling itself as the nation’s military. What happens now? The Council of State, which includes the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Chief Justice, the presidents of the Court of Appeal and the High Court, the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and the Attorney General, will meet on Monday to discuss if the provisions regarding discussions of Government policy are unconstitutional, specifically in relation to freedom of speech protections. It can then decide to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court for determination, or allow it to proceed to presidential signature as normal. How unusual is this? Quite unusual. The Council of State has only been convened to discuss a Bill on 29 occasions since 1940. In 15 of these cases, a decision was taken to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.",0,1
2024/7/16,"Planning Bill criticised as being like ‘tablets of 10 commandments descending from Mount Sinai’  Senator describes 747-page Bill as ‘telephone directory’ and a ‘massive supertanker coming to dock in a very small port’ The Government’s Planning and Reform Bill has been criticised as a “massive supertanker coming in to dock in a very small port” with most of its 560 sections not being debated in the Seanad because of a guillotine. On the second day of discussion in the in the Upper House Independent senator Michael McDowell said reforms in planning should have been made in separate legislation, “so we can see what is new, what is not new and what the philosophy is in the legislation”. He described the 747-page Bill as a “telephone directory” and said somebody decided it was “hugely urgent” when it was not. A direct approach is needed to the housing crisis but it does not need all “this gobbledegook”. The Bill consolidates existing planning law and aims to streamline the planning process and provide for national planning statements, which Government will approve. National development plans will be extended from six to 10 years with reform of An Bord Pleanála including a new name – An Coimisiún Pleanála (Planning Commission). But Mr McDowell said there would be no accountability in the national planning framework mechanism and said it was “absurd” to think one Minister could come up with the framework and get Government colleagues to agree. “This has somehow descended from Mount Sinai like the tablets of the 10 commandments and is brought down to earth, and becomes the cornerstone of all development in this country. This is nonsense. This is not the real world. This is a recipe for sclerosis in a country.” Sinn Féin senator Paul Gavan introduced an amendment calling for these the planning statements to be subject to scrutiny and agreement by the Oireachtas. Independent senator Alice Mary Higgins agreed, describing the national planning statement proposal as “an extraordinary and weird power grab”. The Bill is filled with “ministerial over-reach and the erosion of local democracy and public participation” and the planning statement effectively give a Minister “a carte blanche” on the planning system, she claimed. Minister of State Malcolm Noonan said, however, that he “fundamentally disagreed” that the Bill was unnecessary, insisting it was “absolutely necessary”. “We all want to see a system that works for everyone, that is participative, is inclusive and that supports communities and balanced development,” he said. Earlier, Fine Gael senator Emer Currie introduced an amendment calling for full “transparency and public scrutiny” of applications for telecommunications masts, which currently are exempt from planning permission. The amendment on masts attracted more speakers than any other and Ms Currie said there had been a proliferation of masts in residential areas in recent years “without any public notification or consultation” with 30 alone in west Dublin since 2020. There is a “legitimate questioning of the integrity of the planning system” when “15-metre and 18-metre or higher telecommunications structures have appeared metres from people’s homes, along public roads, sometimes without warning”. Independent Victor Boyhan said “litigation has been taken against parish churches to have the stuff taken off, internally and externally, including on many protected structures”. “We see it on protected structures that are State-owned buildings. There is no comprehensive national mapping exercise” for which there are constant calls, he said. Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick said telecommunications infrastructure is essential but “it is planned by engineers in an abstract way based on the optimal performance of the technology”. Minister of State Malcolm Noonan acknowledged the genuine concerns senators raised and while he was unable to accept the amendment he would ask officials to re-examine the issue and he may introduce an amendment later.",0,1
2024/7/16,"Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs set to vote against Ursula von der Leyen’s re-election as European Commission president Independent Ireland MEP Ciarán Mulloly to decide on supporting German politician after meeting her on Tuesday None of Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs intend to vote for Ursula von der Leyen in the European Parliament when she seeks a second term as president of the European Commission. Ireland South MEP Billy Kelleher confirmed he would not vote for Ms von der Leyen despite having been open to reviewing his opposition if she apologised for her stance on Israel’s invasion of Gaza, as well as other issues. His three party colleagues in the parliament — Barry Andrews, Barry Cowen and Cynthia Ní Mhurchú — also said they would not support Ms von der Leyen, who is the official European People’s Party candidate. Fianna Fáil is a member of the centrist Renew Europe Group — Independent Ireland MEP Ciarán Mullooly and Independent MEP Michael McNamara are also members. The group is supporting Ms von der Leyen’s re-election bid. Mr McNamara said he would not support her nomination while Mr Mullooly said on Monday that he would not decide until after a meeting with Ms von der Leyen on Tuesday evening. The stance of the Fianna Fáil MEPs has led to some friction with the party leadership and with Coalition partners Fine Gael. Tánaiste Micheál Martin has indicated that he as a member of the Government would support Ms von der Leyen’s nomination. He said immediately after the European elections that he would speak to his four MEPs about their intentions, but all have stuck to their positions. Mr Kelleher said on Monday: “This is not a decision I have taken lightly but it is a decision I am comfortable taking based on her actions since October 7th but also equally the inaction of her commission since 2019 in standing up for the rights of the Palestinian people. “President von der Leyen’s inability to call out or criticise the actions of Israel in Gaza, and her seemingly unconditional support for prime minister [Binyamin] Netanyahu, who is now subject to an [International Criminal Court] arrest warrant for his actions, mean I cannot support her re-election,” he said. He said Ms von der Leyen addressed the Renew Europe Group last week and “despite knowing that the Fianna Fáil delegation had serious misgivings about her stance on Gaza, she chose to not reference the issue in her 55-minute speech to our group”.",0,1
2024/7/16,"Paper tax discs for vehicles set to be abolished  Minister for Transport also calls on Dublin City Council to implement transport plan or risk losing funding Motorists will no longer have to display paper tax discs under legislation agreed by the Government, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has said. An Garda Síochána will instead access motor tax information digitally using a vehicle’s registration plate. This system is already operational, but the full change will take some time to come into effect, Mr Ryan said. Speaking after Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting, the Minister also called on local authorities to implement proposed transport plans under the Pathfinder programme or risk losing funding. He drew attention to the Dublin City Centre Transport Plan, saying “delay would not be clever” and would mean “you’d lose your Pathfinder status”. He did not clarify how much money the council would stand to lose if it failed to advance the project. The plan, which will create bus gates at Bachelors Walk and Aston Quay and aims to take a lot of the car traffic out of the city centre, was due to be implemented in August. However, Dublin City Council chief executive Richard Shakespeare has agreed to evaluate the plan following a request from businesses in the city. He is to make a decision next week. Mr Ryan said the transport plan is as much about “rejuvenating Dublin city centre” as it is bringing about a positive climate impact. The Dublin City Centre Traders Alliance, which includes Brown Thomas and Arnotts, recently opposed the roll-out of the plan on the basis that it would significantly reduce business in the city. The Government also discussed the All-Island Strategic Rail Review, which is expected to be approved by the Northern Ireland department for infrastructure soon. “To deliver it,” Mr Ryan said, “would require about a billion a year extra for the next 25 years.” If finalised, the rail plan would reopen certain defunct railway lines on the island and develop the rail system to a level that could compete with other European countries. The Minister said “a long-term, strategic approach” to public transport is necessary, with a particular emphasis on rail “because the benefit is that you get housing solutions with it. You can build density, close to the railroad stations and so on.” A Bill to grant local authorities access to data around road collisions has also been passed and will be delivered quickly to combat ongoing issues around road safety, he said.",0,1
2024/7/17,"Keir Starmer agrees to visit Ireland after dining with Taoiseach at Chequers British prime minister to visit on September 7th, the night of a football match in Dublin between the Republic of Ireland and England Keir Starmer has accepted an invitation from the Taoiseach, Simon Harris, to visit Ireland on September 7th, the night that the Republic of Ireland play England in a Nations League football match in the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Mr Harris invited Mr Starmer at Chequers, the UK leader’s official country residence in Buckinghamshire, where the pair set out to “reset” the Anglo-Irish political relationship that had become strained under the previous Tory administration. Mr Harris was welcomed by the prime minister to the opulent 16th-century country manor estate for dinner on the eve of Thursday’s European Political Community summit of leaders at Blenheim Palace, two hours outside London. The location, amid rolling Chiltern hills, has previously played a significant, if less auspicious, role in recent Ango-Irish relations. It was the setting in 2018 for Theresa May’s ill-fated Chequer’s Brexit plan, which ultimately contributed to her downfall as prime minister. The meeting was touted by both sides as significant, given the fact that the Taoiseach is the first world leader to have been invited to meet the prime minister in Britain since Labour won the election two weeks ago. Mr Starmer said the meeting was “symbolic of the relationship between the two countries” and that he intended to “strengthen and deepen” the relationship between Ireland and Britain. “I am delighted to be here to congratulate you [for winning the election] in person,” said Mr Harris, as the two men sat down in the manor house’s Hawtry room to speak before a pint of Guinness in the garden, and then dinner. Mr Harris also presented Mr Starmer with a Donegal GAA football jersey having heard that the prime minister wears an old Donegal jersey while playing five-a-side football. Mr Starmer has previously said how he bought the top while on honeymoon in Donegal when he “fell in love with the place”. “It means a lot to us in Ireland that you have chosen to have us here as your first guest here in Chequers,” Mr Harris said. “I am looking forward to resetting the Anglo-Irish relationship. We’ve lot of work to do together.” Mr Starmer’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, who ran a pub in Newry, Co Down, during the Troubles, was also present in Chequers. The relationship between London and Dublin has been under severe strain in recent years. The turbulence caused by Brexit and the Conservative government’s controversial laws to deal with the legacy of the Troubles were areas of significant tension. It was confirmed in the King’s Speech on Wednesday that the Labour government would repeal the Legacy Act. One of Mr Starmer’s first actions after entering Downing Street was to hold a phone conversation with the Taoiseach and to invite him to the face-to-face meeting. Mr Harris had said in advance that he expected to discuss Northern Ireland and the situations in Gaza and Ukraine during his meeting with the prime minister. In a joint statement afterwards, Mr Harris and Mr Starmer said they had “noted that the ties which bind both countries span geography and history, family and business, politics and culture”. They agreed to work together over the coming weeks to put in place arrangements to support, encourage and strengthen all aspects of relations. “As a first step towards rebuilding this unique partnership, the prime minister and Taoiseach committed to annual summits at which they will take stock of joint work to deepen and reinvigorate cooperation,” the statement said. “They discussed the Good Friday Agreement as co-guarantors and their shared commitment to its principles and institutions, and to furthering prosperity and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. They discussed legacy issues, working to support all communities and victims in Northern Ireland. “Their discussions also covered global issues, including support to Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. “They both agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages, and urgent action to address the humanitarian crisis. The Taoiseach welcomed the Prime Minister’s commitment to closer cooperation with the European Union.”",0,1
2024/7/18,"Fine Gael will have candidates for half of its departing TDs by end of July Party intensifies preparations for next general election with all selection conventions due to be held by September 22nd Fine Gael will have selected replacement candidates for half of its departing TDs within the next two weeks as it ramps up general election preparations. Selection conventions will by the end of the month have been held in seven of the 14 constituencies where Fine Gael TDs elected in 2020 will not be seeking a return to the Dáil. Party leader and Taoiseach Simon Harris, along with the other Coalition leaders, has repeatedly insisted the intention is for the Government will run its full term into early next year. However, there has been much speculation that voters could be going to the polls in November after the Government’s last budget. Fine Gael plans to have all of its selection conventions completed by September 22nd. Of the 17 conventions that will have been held before the end of July, 11 are in places where the party has a departing TD or other constituencies where it currently has no seat such as Waterford and Tipperary South. A party source pushed back against the suggestion there is a strategy to finalise these tickets first to allow new candidates to bed in before the election, saying “all constituencies are priorities”. Wednesday night saw the selection of councillors Bridín Murphy and Cathal Byrne to run in Wexford in an attempt to retain the Dáil seat being vacated by Paul Kehoe. Five potential candidates – former TD Pat Deering, Catherine Callaghan, Orla Kelly, Cllr Michael Doyle and Cllr David Fitzgerald – are due to compete for at least two places on the Carlow-Kilkenny ticket, where sitting TD John Paul Phelan will not be contesting the election. Cork East will hold its selection convention on Friday with Mark Stanton, the son of departing TD David Stanton, vying for a place on the ticket with Cllr Noel McCarthy. Next week will see five hopefuls compete at the Cork South Central selection convention, where the party’s long-time TD Simon Coveney has confirmed he will not be contesting the next election. The Cork North-West selection convention will be held in the last week of July, with Michael Creed TD set to stand aside at the next election. Dublin lord mayor James Geoghegan was the first Fine Gael candidate selected back in January. He will run in Dublin Bay South where Fine Gael has not had a seat since former minister Eoghan Murphy left politics in 2021. Earlier this month, councillors Naoise Ó Muirí and Aoibhinn Tormey were selected to run in Dublin Bay North as the party seeks to keep the seat being vacated by former minister Richard Bruton. A convention for Dublin West, where former taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed this week he will not be seeking re-election, is not due to be held until September.",0,1
2024/7/18,"Harris rejects Orban’s attempts to get EU to row back on military support for Ukraine Hungarian prime minister touted new plan following recent trips to Beijing and Moscow and talks with Trump Taoiseach Simon Harris has dismissed the attempt by Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, to get the European Union to reverse its military backing for Ukraine and instead try to broker talks between Russia and the country it invaded in 2022. Mr Orban, whose country holds the rotating European Union presidency, has touted a new plan following his recent trips to Beijing and Moscow and talks with US presidential election favourite, Donald Trump. Speaking to reporters on the fringes of the European Political Community (EPC) summit in Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, Mr Harris said the Hungarian prime minister “has no role whatsoever” in speaking for the European Council of national leaders. “He didn’t speak for us when he visited Moscow. He didn’t speak for us when he visited China. I look forward to working with him on issues related to the [EU] presidency… but not in relation to foreign policy.” The Taoiseach said the EU council was “absolutely united” in its support for Ukraine, which is continuing to fight the Russian invasion. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is among the 45 heads of state at the EPC, which is being hosted by Britain’s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, on the opulent Blenheim estate where Winston Churchill was born. Mr Harris sidestepped a question about the atmosphere in the room among EPC leaders, as Mr Zelenskiy and Mr Orban came face to face for the first time since Hungary’s leader effectively called for Ukraine to sue for peace against Russia. The Taoiseach confirmed, however, that the Irish Government “stands ready to play a more active role” in providing non-military support to Ukraine, which he intends to visit in September at the invitation of Mr Zelenskiy. “I really want to do more on the humanitarian side,” said the Taoiseach, suggesting that the State’s involvement could be themed around the issue of Ukrainian children who are abducted and taken to Russia. “We need these children to stop being snatched,” he said. The Taoiseach also suggested the Republic could act as a “bridge over the Atlantic” between the European Union and the US if Mr Trump was re-elected president in November. “Any US president might or might not want to use [that bridge]. We stand ready to work with whoever it is,” he said. Mr Harris expressed optimism that the EPC summit would help to heal relations between the UK and the EU. While there, he met French president Emmanuel Macron, Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr Store and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk among other European leaders,  as well as the leader of the Belarusian opposition, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Mr Harris’s trip to the EPC capped a politically successful two-day trip to Britain, which also included a meeting with Mr Starmer for dinner on Wednesday night at Chequers, the British prime minister’s 1,000-acre country estate.",0,1
2024/7/19,"Sipo silent as deadline passes for challenging High Court ruling on Leo Varadkar leak case TD who brought judicial review case calls on the Sipo to respond to judgement publicly  The deadline for the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) to challenge a critical High Court ruling on the Leo Varadkar leak case has passed without the public ethics body saying whether it will appeal the judgment. The Sipo’s task is to promote transparency and accountability in public life. But it has had nothing to say about the ruling of Mr Justice Barry O’Donnell that quashed its decision not to investigate Mr Varadkar’s leak of a draft medical contract in his first term as taoiseach. The judge’s ruling of June 21st started the clock on a 28-day countdown for submitting any appeal, leading to a deadline on Friday that came and went without Sipo stating its intentions. “Due to the nature of Sipo’s role as an impartial oversight body, we are not in a position to comment on the query addressed in your email,” it said in response to questions. “We have no further comments at this time.” The Sipo chairman is Garrett Sheehan, retired judge of the Court of Appeal. He was “not available” when The Irish Times sought an interview on the High Court ruling. The commission’s 2022 decision against investigating the leak split the Sipo, the first time it ever lacked unanimity for a ruling. That came after the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to bring criminal charges over the leak. Three Sipo members voted against an investigation: Mr Sheehan, clerk of the Dáil Peter Finnegan and clerk of the Seanad Martin Groves. The objections of two of the State’s most senior independent officials – Comptroller and Auditor General Séamus McCarthy and Ombudsman Ger Deering – were overruled. The successful judicial review case against the decision was taken by People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy. The judge found Sipo explanations were inadequately reasoned, saying the TD could have an order requiring the commission to re-examine the case. Mr Murphy said Sipo should quickly move to investigate. “This happened in 2019. It became public, and I complained, in 2020. We got the decision in 2022 not to investigate. It’s now the middle of 2024,” he said. “Assuming that they do not appeal by the end of the day I think there is an onus on Sipo to now expedite this.” He called on the Sipo to set out its assessment of the High Court ruling. “This judgment has implications beyond just the Varadkar case because this wasn’t a decision made on the facts. It was a decision based on an argument that Leo Varadkar made,” Mr Murphy said. “I think for people to have confidence that Sipo is a body capable and interested in holding those in power to account they really need to respond to this judgment publicly.”",0,1
2024/7/20,"UK government could face court challenge to force unity referendum, says Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty Vague rules surrounding trigger mean decisions either way could face judicial review The Northern Ireland Secretary of State, who has authority under the Belfast Agreement to call an Irish unity referendum, could face a court challenge in the years ahead to force it be to be held, senior Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty said.. Under the Belfast Agreement, the Northern Secretary will call a referendum once it appears to them that a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would vote in favour of a united Ireland if given the opportunity. However, the rules governing the process by which this decision would be made are vague, since it is unclear whether a judgment would be made on polling figures, recent election results, census numbers or other data. Speaking to the Patrick MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Co Donegal, Mr Doherty said it has been accepted by the British government that the Northern Secretary’s decision could be judicially reviewable. “If he or she were to trigger a referendum where in his or her view there was no support for united Ireland, then he or she could be taken to court. The opposite is also the case,” he said. “You could have a situation where through the court you could force the Secretary of State to trigger this,” he said, adding that he believed that a unity referendum will be held, and that it will happen in a few years. On the subject of planning for a united Ireland, he said: “It isn’t about the romantic notion of four green fields. It’s actually to deal with the nuts and bolts. What does the economy look like? What does the health service look like? How does our social welfare system work in a united Ireland?” Unfortunately, he said, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have not begun this planning work, though he believed that there are many in those parties, including Leo Varadkar, who now favour such work being done. The momentum supports the belief that a referendum is inevitable, he said, pointing to the congratulations that were offered to Sinn Féin’s Alex Maskey by all sides in Stormont when he stepped down as speaker of the Assembly. Maskey, he said, was the first Sinn Féin councillor elected to Belfast City Council in 1983: “[Unionists then] used to lock the doors, change the meeting rooms, they used to spray air freshener. Behind him they used to throw oranges at him in meetings. “Why do I say that? It is not about bragging. It is again to show people that demographics and change is happening dramatically in the north. So, is there going to be a referendum? Absolutely. Unionism knows that. The other political parties in the state know that.” The promised offered by the Belfast Agreement has not been fully realised, he said: “We now have the opportunity to rebuild this island and to create a new and united Ireland where the identities of all are respected. “Where the potential of every person and community is cherished. A united Ireland where equality, respect and social justice are our guiding principles. We are on the brink of change, but we need to plan for it, we need to create it,” he went on. Questioned about the evident lack of enthusiasm displayed by British prime minister Keir Starmer for a unity referendum, Mr Doherty said no British government will “have Irish interests at heart. “Six years ago the former leader of the DUP came here and said that if we had a referendum on Irish unity that was successful without planning, it would be terrible. We would repeat the same mistakes as Brexit.”",0,1
2024/7/21,"Households who fail to pay TV licence may face immediate fixed-charge notice  Viewers may need to key in a code to access publicly funded content Households may face immediate fixed-charge notice penalties if they do not pay the television licence fee, under fresh proposals due to be considered by Government this week. There could also be a degree of opt-in which would see a person need to key in a code to access publicly funded content. Businesses with a large number of screens could also face higher charges, while An Post could be given access to information from the local property tax register in a bid to crack down on evasion by using the full range of available information. In a written submission to Minister of State in the Department of Communications James Lawless, An Post said the current TV licence database is about 40 years old and requires increasingly scarce skilled resources to manage. It also outlined new potential measures for enforcement. At present, if a household has not paid the TV licence, a court summons is issued. An Post is now proposing that rather than issuing a court summons, a fixed-charge notice would be issued if the fee isn’t paid within a certain time period. “The amount of that fixed-charge notice should be sufficient to act as a deterrent on payment,” the letter says. If the fixed-charge notice is unpaid, a court summons would then be issued. Inspectors would still be kept on to ensure houses that have signed a declaration of exemption are operating within the rules. A number of suggestions have also been made to overhaul the TV licence database. The database does not contain the full list of residential and business premises and about 20 per cent of it is “anonymous” in that it only has details such as “occupier” while about 35 per cent of the entries are non-unique and predominantly rural addresses. In order to modernise the database, An Post has suggested two options: input data from the local property tax system or use the actual local property tax system and input TV licence data on to that. In the letter, it is also suggested to Mr Lawless that extending liability for the TV licence to all devices instead of just the TV could broaden the paid pool by almost 360,000 households, although there would still be challenges to confirm the possession of a device within a household. If the liability was extended it would be assumed that every household has a device unless the householder submitted a statutory declaration that there are no devices capable of receiving public media. Businesses could also follow the example of the UK, where a single licence fee is paid for the first 15 units, and then another fee is paid for every five units thereafter. Pubs, hotels, bookies and hospitals would be in scope for that additional charge. A source close to Mr Lawless said there was “an argument for making it a per-device fee rather than per TV.” These ideas are “all in the mix”, the source said. At the final Cabinet meeting of the summer this week, Ministers are also expected to agree a new funding model for RTÉ which would see the broadcaster receive multiannual funding from the State while also retaining the TV licence.",0,1
2024/7/23,"Fine Gael select city and county-based councillors for bid to retain Coveney’s Cork seat Shane O’Callaghan and Una McCarthy defeat Jerry Buttimer, Des Cahill and John Mullins for nominations Fine Gael have selected Cork city-based Cllr Shane O’Callaghan and Cork county-based Cllr Una McCarthy to run in Cork South Central as they bid to retain former Tánaiste Simon Coveney’s seat in the forthcoming general election. Cllr O’Callaghan and Cllr McCarthy defeated Senator Jerry Buttimer, Cllr Des Cahill of Cork City Council and unsuccessful Ireland South Euro candidate, John Mullins to secure the nominations to run in the general election Cllr O’Callaghan topped the poll in the Cork South Central Ward in Cork City Council with 1,870 votes to be elected on the first count in last month’s local elections and announced soon after he would be seeking a nomination to run in the general election. A native of Bandon in west Cork, Cllr O’Callaghan, a barrister, was first elected to Cork City Council in 2019 when he took 1,234 first preferences. He served as Deputy Lord of Cork for 12 months from 2020. Meanwhile his general election running mate, Cllr McCarthy, a native of Rochestown now living in Carrigaline, Cllr McCarthy joined Cork County Council in October 2023 when she was co-opted to replace Cllr Michael Paul Murtagh to represent the Carrigaline Electoral Area. The daughter of Cork All-Ireland winning Cork hurler Justin McCarthy Snr and the sister of RTÉ broadcaster, Justin McCarthy Jnr, Cllr McCarthy, who teaches in Passage West in Cork Harbour, held the seat for Fine Gael in last month’s local elections when she polled 1,092 votes. Several party sources suggested to The Irish Times that they expect Fine Gael HQ will add a third candidate to the ticket to give the party a real chance of taking a second seat in the five-seater as Sinn Féin struggle in opinion polls. Meanwhile, sitting TD Alan Farrell was also selected to contest Dublin Fingal East on Tuesday evening. Fine Gael has now chosen 22 candidates in 14 constituencies. It is expected to select candidates in half of its seats with departing TDs by the end of July as it ramps up election preparations. Mr Coveney informed Fine Gael members in Cork South Central a fortnight ago that after 26 years in representative politics that he would not be seeking re-election in Cork South Central, which has become a five-seater constituency following the recent revision. He was first elected in a by-election in 1998 following the death of his father Hugh Coveney and he held the seat until 2004 when he was elected an MEP for Ireland South before returning to domestic politics in 2007 when he was re-elected for Cork South Central. A member of Cabinet since 2011, he lost out to Leo Varadkar in the contest to succeed Enda Kenny as Taoiseach in 2017 but he served as Tánaiste from then until the current Coalition was formed in 2020 and he moved from the Foreign Affairs to Enterprise, Trade and Employment.",0,1
2024/7/24,"Former minister Éamon Ó Cuív to retire from politics at next election Tánaiste Micheál Martin has paid tribute to Mr Ó Cuív’s commitment to peace and reconciliation on island of Ireland Former minister Éamon Ó Cuív will not contest the next general election and is to retire from politics. “After deep consideration, I have decided not to seek a nomination to stand in the next general election,” Mr Ó Cuív said in a statement on Wednesday. “In the meantime I will continue to work as usual. I would like to thank everybody who supports me in my work.” Mr Ó Cuív has been a Fianna Fáil TD for the Galway West constituency since the 1992 general election. He previously served as deputy leader of Fianna Fáil from 2011 to 2012; minister for social protection from 2010 to 2011; minister for community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs from 2002 to 2010; and as a minister of state from 1997 to 2002. He also served as minister for the environment, community and local government and minister for defence from January to March 2011. Tánaiste Micheál Martin paid tribute to Mr Ó Cuív following the announcement. “Eamon was an outstanding parliamentarian and minister,” he said. “He is extremely committed, hard-working and diligent. He has been a tremendous public representative for the people of Galway West and Cornamona. “I worked with Eamon both in the Dáil and in cabinet, and subsequently in 2011 around the regeneration and revitalisation of the party. He is one of the most conscientious and dedicated politicians I’ve ever worked with.” Mr Martin said Mr Ó Cuív had a long-term commitment to peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland and played an important role in the lead up to the Belfast Agreement. “In his capacity as minister for the Gaeltacht and rural affairs, he was pioneering and innovative in terms of the language Act and a new era of support for the Irish language. “He developed the Clár programme, which was the first of its kind in terms of support for rural Ireland. “Eamon will be a huge loss to public life and I would like to pay tribute to his wife Áine and his children who gave him tremendous support throughout his career.”",0,1
2024/7/25,"Ireland set to ignore von der Leyen’s request for two names for commission candidate Tánaiste Micheál Martin says Ireland’s ‘clear decision’ is nominating Michael McGrath  The Government is set to ignore a formal request from European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen that EU member states put forward the name of at least one woman for nomination as a commissioner. The Government’s position has been that it will nominate former finance minister Michael McGrath and would not propose a second nominee to fill Ireland’s place on the commission Taoiseach Simon Harris last week confirmed that the Government would not bow to Ms von der Leyen’s call for two candidates. The Irish Times understands that Mr McGrath will remain as Ireland’s sole nominee regardless of Ms von der Leyen’s letter making the formal request for two names. Speaking after her re-election as head of the commission last week, Ms von der Leyen had said she would ask countries to put forward two names, a man and a woman, as their nominees to pick from to allow her to put together a gender-balanced team. The German politician has since written to EU countries including Ireland requesting two names, stating at least one should be a woman, a commission source stated. Ms von der Leyen has said where countries put forward existing commissioners for a further term, as Slovakia, Latvia and the Netherlands intend to do, they do not need to nominate a second name. Her letter gave national governments until August 30th to put forward names. At a press conference on Thursday, Tánaiste Micheál Martin gave no indication that Ireland will provide the name of a woman candidate alongside Mr McGrath, saying it was the “clear decision” of the Government to nominate the former finance minister. Mr Martin said the Government “will respond in due course” to Ms von der Leyen’s letter. He added that “jurisdiction” for Ireland’s nominee for the commission is “within the Government’s realm”. Government sources later confirmed that no other name will be put forward by Dublin. Ms von der Leyen intends to interview candidates before deciding what portfolio to allocate each country’s commissioner. The successful nominees would then have to be approved by the European Parliament, which traditionally rejects at least one proposed commissioner. Ireland is seeking a finance-related commission portfolio again, with outgoing Irish commissioner Mairead McGuinness having held the role responsible for financial services. However, competition for finance briefs in the next commission is expected to be intense. Ireland’s chances of a prominent position could be damaged by the decision to ignore Ms von der Leyen’s request for countries to nominate two candidates. This is compounded by the fact four MEPs from Mr McGrath’s party, Fianna Fáil, voted against Ms von der Leyen’s recent appointment for a second term in a crunch European Parliament confirmation vote. Defending the nomination of Mr McGrath last week, Mr Harris said the European Union treaties “do allow member states to decide their commissioner, and I do think it’s important that we have that right to adhere to the treaties”. Saying that it was his “absolute determination” to work closely with Ms von der Leyen, Mr Harris said he believed the EC president is “a fair person who will want to assemble the best team”. He added: “There’s been occasions when we’ve sent one name and that’s been a female. Or one name who was a man. On this occasion we are sending the name of Michael McGrath. That’s not to be in any way disrespectful to the view of the president.” Mr Harris also said: “We’ve just asked our finance minister to not be the finance minister. He has stepped down from Cabinet, and he’s now preparing very intensively. I think it’s important to provide him with that certainty as he does that as well.”",0,1
2024/7/25,"Fake online ads using Micheál Martin’s image believed to have originated in Belarus and Russia Tánaiste speaks about efforts to learn identity of those behind adverts as he outlines Government plans to overhaul defamation laws Fake online adverts using Tánaiste Micheál Martin’s image are believed to have originated in Belarus and Russia. The Fianna Fáil leader spoke about his efforts to learn the identity of those behind the adverts as he outlined Government plans to overhaul Ireland’s defamation laws. Currently people seeking the identity of anonymous people behind defamatory online advertising or social media posts must seek an order from the High Court directing internet companies to provide such information. Under the Government’s plans to reform Ireland’s defamation laws, the Circuit Court would be able to make the so-called Norwich Pharmacal order to direct tech companies to provide the details. This is to be included in an amendment to the Bill and should result in reduced legal costs for people who believe they have been defamed online. Speaking about his own experience Mr Martin said “it did strike me as extraordinarily challenging for individual citizens to seek the identity of such online defamers”. Mr Martin last year took a High Court action against Google seeking information about the people behind fake adverts relating to cryptocurrency that used his image and appeared on legitimate websites. Google did not oppose the order and subsequently provided information. Mr Martin said: “The fake ads seem to have originated from jurisdictions in Belarus and Russia”. He added: “It seems that stolen credit cards were used to pay for the ads.” He also said: “Notwithstanding the fact that we’ve received a High Court order I’ve written again to Google in respect to the ads that appeared on Google to get further clarity on the steps it now intends to take because there seems to be a model of revenue generation here that’s unacceptable.” Mr Martin said: “We’ve had great difficulty in identifying the people who actually paid for the ads, notwithstanding having secured a High Court order.” He said that Google co-operated with the High Court Order and “we received an enormous amount of documentation” and people had to be employed to forensically go through to try to identify who paid for the fake ads. Asked if he felt his criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had anything to do with him being targeted, he replied: “I don’t know” and he “can’t make definitive comments in respect of that”. Separately, Mr Martin was again the subject of fake adverts on the X social media platform which ran in the run up to the family and care referendums earlier this year. Mr Martin said: “We’ve had far less co-operation from X who had a whole series of fake ads in respect of my good self and others ... in advance of the referendum.” Google declined to comment on the matter. The Irish Times has attempted to contact X for comment. The Defamation (Amendment) Bill is to go before the Oireachtas in the Autumn. The plan to abolish juries for High Court defamation actions is a key measure designed to reduce the likelihood of disproportionate awards of damages. NewsBrands, a representative body for Irish news publishers, has welcomed the Bill with its chief executive Ann Marie Lenihan saying the reforms “will lead to reduced costs for news publishers, costs which were threatening the very viability of investigative journalism and having a chilling effect on the reporting of matters in the public interest.” She expressed disappointment that NewsBrands’ recommendation that there be a “serious harm test” was not included in the Bill and urged reconsideration. Such a test – previously introduced in England and Wales – would require claimants to prove at the outset of a case that the alleged defamation was likely to cause serious harm to their reputation.",0,1
2024/7/26,"Ireland won’t be ‘punished’ over EU commissioner nomination clash, Harris says Unfair to ask Michael McGrath to resign from Cabinet for ‘50-50′ chance of EU job, Taoiseach says It was unlikely Ireland would be punished by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen over a dispute around the nomination of the next EU commissioner, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. The Government has insisted it will nominate only former minister for finance Michael McGrath as the country’s next EU commissioner, despite a request from Ms von der Leyen for member states to put forward the names of a man and a woman for her to pick from. Ms von der Leyen, who recently secured a second term at the top of the European Commission, on Thursday wrote to governments seeking their nominations for commissioners. The letter from the senior EU politician asked countries to propose at least two names, with one being a woman, to allow Ms von der Leyen to get a gender balance in the team of commissioners. Speaking in Paris, Mr Harris said it would have been “unfair” to ask Mr McGrath to step down from Cabinet for a “50-50″ chance of becoming the next Irish commissioner. “President von der Leyen is well aware of the Irish Government’s position in relation to our own nomination,” he said. The Fine Gael leader said he did not think Ireland would face any “punishment” from Ms von der Leyen, when the German decided what commissioner portfolio to give to Mr McGrath. “I know president von der Leyen to be a very serious, competent and a fair politician ... I know from my conversation with her that she will assess the suitability of commissioners for portfolios based on their background, based on their CV, based on interviews that she will carry out,” he said. Ireland is pursuing a finance-related commissioner role, but is facing intense competition from several other countries also chasing one of the handful of finance briefs. “Michael McGrath has had to step down from Cabinet, that’s a pretty profound thing for him to have to do. I think it would be an unfair thing for him to have to do and then tell him he has a 50-50 chance of getting a role at the end of it,” Mr Harris said. It had been important that Mr McGrath could step down to focus on the commission job, and a new minister for finance could be brought in to prepare for the coming budget in October, he said. Mr Harris added there was “an understanding” at European level of the Government’s decision. Further compounding Ireland’s uphill lobbying efforts for a prominent portfolio is the fact that Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs opposed Ms von der Leyen getting a second term in a recent European Parliament confirmation vote. “It’s a matter for Fianna Fáil MEPs to account for their own actions, not me, but as the Taoiseach I am satisfied we have sent a politician of substance in Michael McGrath,” Mr Harris said. EU countries have until August 30th to respond to the commission president’s request for nominations, following which Ms von der Leyen will interview candidates before allocating portfolios.",0,1
2024/7/27,"Immigration set to be crunch topic in the next general election as Sinn Féin revises policy  Many parties have broadly similar policies - and none of their measures will magic away an issue leading to heightened tensions in communities  October, November, next February – no matter when the forthcoming general election falls, this coming Dáil term will be the last full term of the current Government. Over the last four years there has been a global pandemic that shuttered the world, an ensuing spike in inflation that led to a cost-of-living crisis and, in domestic politics, a historic rotation of the office of Taoiseach. That’s not to mention the unexpected resignation of a taoiseach and another Coalition party leader, a few TDs stepping out of politics and a finance minister leaving for Europe months before the last budget. There was a failed referendum, a surprising set of local and European elections and many confidence motions tabled by the Opposition. Another major global event that has created unforeseen long-term consequences is Russia’s invasion and war on Ukraine. The war displaced millions at a time of already heightened worldwide geopolitical tensions. The topic of immigration has undoubtedly become a major domestic political issue as the Government struggles to find accommodation for both refugees and asylum seekers against the backdrop of an unrelenting housing crisis. To put the figures in context, the total number of applicants for international protection (IP)  in 2022 and 2023 – 26,900 – was greater than the total received over the entire eight years before that. And from January until the end of this June, there were 10,604 such applications. That’s a 93.9 per cent increase on the same period in 2023. If the trend continues, the number of IP arrivals into Ireland this year is likely to surpass 20,000, which would be a new record. What do the statistics tell us? They show that the level of demand on the system and on infrastructure remains acute, which means that heightened tensions in communities will more than likely continue and immigration will remain a front-and-centre issue in the next election, whether it takes place later this year or early next. Sinn Féin this week launched a new set of immigration policies which appear to be aimed at reclaiming some support lost in working-class communities and other under-pressure localities where asylum seekers have been housed. The decision to publish the eight-page document so soon after a disappointing local election in early June shows that immigration is not just an issue that is worrying the Government – it is preoccupying the minds of Opposition parties too. Sinn Féin is proposing that a pre-assessment be carried out examining the constraints within a community before any asylum seekers are housed there. They say that disadvantaged areas should not be asked to accommodate new arrivals and that better-off areas should shoulder more responsibility. The main Opposition party also proposes accelerating processing times for applications and says that certain areas of a country could be declared safe in order to accelerate considerations further. What’s behind the shift in tone, and will it work? “Sinn Féin have had six weeks to take stock of their very poor European and local election results and it seems clear to me that it has decided that an inconsistent message on immigration harmed it in its core working-class areas,” says Gary Murphy, professor of politics at Dublin City University. “This would seem to be the only logical conclusion to draw from its proposal to audit all communities and gain local input on facilities before deciding where to house asylum seekers.” Murphy says that in stating that middle-class or better-off areas need to take a greater share of asylum seekers than before, the party is making a calculation that it needs to ensure it retains its 2020 vote – the biggest share of any party, at 24.5 per cent – and is prioritising this over any attempted gains in middle-class areas. “I suspect it’s about saying to the electorate that we’re not the same as Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who don’t care about you, and we do,” he said. “The problem arises when they have to publish these audits and explain why one area was picked over another but they’ll be hoping to be in government by then and, of course, being in a coalition government means almost any policy can be modified.” Other Opposition parties have also given this subject some thought. The Labour Party has compiled a detailed immigration position document. They want to see a new stand-alone agency for integration, migration and asylum. Theoretically, under this body, the processing of most applications wouldn’t take longer than three months. This body would manage reception centres, while a communications plan would see local authorities, elected and community reps “included early in the information-sharing process”, but no one would have a “veto on where people can live”, the party says. Labour leader Ivana Bacik says it is “crucial” that the Government move swiftly to implement the recommendations of the report by former European Commission secretary general Catherine Day, who chaired an advisory group to develop a long-term plan to provide accommodation for IP applicants.  This would involve the establishment of “a number of large State-owned reception and integration centres, and that they launch the national public information campaign we called for before, to counter the disinformation being spread by the far right and those who are anti-migration”, said Bacik. The Social Democrats are now also finalising a new immigration policy, which strategists have been working on for  months. A source said the party wants to see a framework for providing resources to support communities where IP applicants are being housed. They want to see a move away from the over-reliance on private provision of accommodation to purpose-built State-owned centres. They will also call for significantly more staff and resources for the International Protection Office (IPO). Aontú wants to see communities who agree to host migrants given a “community dividend” and they also want to see asylum applications completed within four months. Under their proposal, if an application is refused, the person should be “sent home within six months”. People Before Profit, meanwhile, have pledged to “stand up to racism and the scapegoating of refugees”. There is no doubt the Government has hardened its own immigration policy in recent months. Tented encampments on Mount Street and around the Grand Canal in south Dublin city centre have been repeatedly packed up and moved to other more formal tented sites with facilities, with Taoiseach Simon Harris at one stage referring to the rows of makeshift tents as a “shantytown”. Benefits for Ukrainians have been cut while Ministers also announced means-testing for asylum seekers, which applies to the daily expenses allowances given to people living in direct provision and international protection settings. The Government has pledged to add hundreds of staff in the IPO and to free up more gardaí for immigration duties. Many of the Government’s policies on this issue are broadly similar to those of the Opposition: striving for greater levels of communication, ramping up the number of staff in the IPO and finding ways to increase the processing time of applications. None of those measures will magic the issue away, and the data is there to back up the assertion that immigration will still be a major focal point of the next election campaign. A report on asylum trends, which was compiled by the Department of Justice earlier this month, reveals a system under increasing strain. The number of applications pending in the IPO continues to trend upwards month on month. There were 22,965 applications pending in June, in comparison with 16,566 last September. The number of pending applications in the International Protection Appeals Tribunal has also been trending upwards since January 2023, with 5,821 applications pending. The median processing time for determining an outcome to an asylum application has also been slowly increasing, although there was a slight decrease in June 2024. The median processing time to the determination stage for standard cases was 79 weeks in June compared with 83 weeks in May and 82 weeks in April. In the debate around immigration policy, a huge amount of attention has also been given to deportation orders; Sinn Féin stated this week that that they wanted “greater follow-up” on such orders. Last month, 176 deportation orders were signed, while 132 were actually issued. The Government is making arrangements for the supply of charter flight services for deportation, which could be up and running by the end of the year. Coalition strategists were this week watching Sinn Féin’s new policy announcements carefully, aware of how politically febrile the issue has become. Their own next move remains to be seen.",0,1
2024/7/27,"Taoiseach says continued rise in numbers of homeless ‘peculiar’ given social housing increases Government to examine how local councils allocate social housing The Government is to examine how local authorities are allocating social housing to people on waiting lists to ensure enough priority is being given to individuals and families who are homeless, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. More than 14,000 people are currently recorded as homeless in the State, including 4,400 children, according to latest Department of Housing figures published on Friday. Speaking in Paris, Mr Harris said he was concerned that the numbers of people who were homeless continued to increase, despite an increase in the amount of new social housing being delivered. “We’re obviously seeing a very significant increase in housing supply, we’re seeing a very significant increase in social housing and yet we’re also seeing homeless figures rise,” he said. The Fine Gael leader said preliminary work was under way to review how councils allocated State-provided social housing to people on waiting lists. “If we have people who have been homeless, if we have people who are homeless with children, what do we do to ensure, as the number of social homes increases and very significantly increases in Ireland, that we begin to make progress on the homeless figures as well,” he said. Mr Harris said there was a “peculiar situation” where the number of social homes being allocated was at the highest levels in decades, yet homelessness was still increasing. “Housing supply is very significantly increasing, 308 new homes going to construction every single working day, and yet ... the homeless figures are not going in the direction we want them to,” he said. How local authorities and councils are allocating housing needs “consideration”, he said. Mr Harris said he would be talking to local authorities about the matter and bringing it up at a Cabinet subcommittee on housing. The aim was to ensure the increase in State provided housing had a “knock-on beneficial effect on our homeless numbers”, as he said it was “counter-intuitive to see the opposite happening”. The increase in the numbers of asylum seekers coming to Ireland for protection also had an impact on housing. “We are seeing the two greatest societal challenges of our time, both housing and migration, somewhat intertwine,” Mr Harris said.  People who were granted asylum status moving out of direct provision accommodation centres was having “an impact” on other State services, he said. Mr Harris, who travelled to Paris for the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, was speaking to reporters after a reception for the families of Team Ireland athletes in the Irish embassy in Paris on Saturday morning. “100 years ago Ireland participated for the first time in the Olympics as an independent State, it was here in this city as well. On that occasion we sent a grand total of zero women athletes, in 1964 we sent one female athlete,” Mr Harris said. “Today out of a squad of 133 athletes, 66 are women, this is the first Olympic Games that has parity.”",0,1
2024/7/29,"Ways to ease impact of residential zoned land tax on farmers set to be considered before budget Minister for Agriculture pushing for resolution on issue that IFA and rural TDs say will pose significant difficulties for farmers Ways of easing the impact of the residential zoned land tax (RZLT) on landowners who are actively farming on fields zoned for housing are set to be considered in advance of the budget. The tax is due to kick in next year, with landowners facing an annual 3 per cent payment on the market value of land that is earmarked for housing and also serviced by infrastructure that would allow residential development. Farming organisations and rural TDs have said the RZLT will pose significant difficulties for farmers. There are concerns over the cost of the tax compared with the income farmers can derive from the land being farmed. In recent weeks there has been renewed pressure to bring in an exemption for landowners actively farming on land that will fall under the scope of the tax as part of the upcoming budget. The Irish Times understands that RZLT was discussed at the first pre-budget meeting between Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue and Minister for Finance Jack Chambers. A source said Fianna Fáil TD Mr McConalogue has pushed for the issues surrounding the RZLT “closed off as a priority”. He is said to recognise the importance of progressing housing policy but is concerned that while RZLT will impact other landowners, it affects farmers’ livelihoods. Areas expected to be discussed in advance of the budget include some form of relief from RZLT for landowners who can show they are actively farming the land. It is also understood that Mr McConalogue believes that the current dezoning system is not sufficient for active farmers and a resolution that allows them to continue to farm is “imperative”. The RZLT, first announced in 2021, is designed to encourage the activation of residential zoned land that is also serviced by infrastructure such as roads, water and electricity. The tax was due to take effect this year but it was announced as part of last year’s budget that it would be deferred for a year until February 1st, 2025. This was to allow landowners more time to submit requests for a change in the zoning of their land to local authorities as part of the 2024/2025 annual mapping process associated with the RZLT. Landowners had until the end of May to make submissions on the annual draft maps in relation to land they wished to make a rezoning request for. Local authorities are the decision-makers for rezoning requests. A pre-budget submission from the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) published this month says farmers are “not speculators, nor have they caused the current housing problems”. It wants “all genuinely farmed land” to be exempted from RZLT, saying: “As it currently stands, many farmers will be forced to sell their land.” The IFA also said: “Farmers challenging the RZLT maps and applying to local authorities to have their land dezoned must be accommodated without being disadvantaged.” Earlier this month Fine Gael made a commitment to exempt working farmers from the RZLT after Mayo TD Michael Ring brought a motion on the issue to a meeting of its parliamentary party. Asked about calls for exemptions, a Department of Finance statement said the RZLT “aims to bring those lands which have benefited from investment in services and are capable of being developed forward for housing”. It highlighted how the tax is an action contained in the Government’s Housing for All plan aimed at increasing housing supply. The statement also said the Department of Finance regularly engages with the Departments of Housing and Agriculture on the implementation of the RZLT.",0,1
2024/7/29,"Driving test waiting time still more than 10 weeks despite hope target could be met by mid-2024 Briefing paper for new road safety junior minister shows wait times remain above 15 weeks amid strong demand Driving test waiting times are still more than 10 weeks, despite hopes that this target could be met by the middle of the year. A briefing document prepared for the new Minister of State with responsibility for road safety James Lawless put the average estimated waiting time for learner drivers who have applied for a test at more than 15 weeks. His predecessor, Jack Chambers, told the Dáil earlier this year that waiting times had reduced from 30 weeks last August to 15 weeks by the end of March. Mr Chambers said the Road Safety Authority (RSA) had informed him that, since the appointment of an additional 75 driving testers, waiting times had steadily reduced and that a waiting time of 10 weeks would be “restored by the middle of the year”. However, the briefing for Mr Lawless — prepared at the end of June — shows that this has still not happened, with the waiting time standing at 15.6 weeks. The document says: “While this is still above the service level agreement target of 10 weeks, significant progress has been made since last August.” It says the service is “facing unprecedented demand” and progress was made through the sanctioning of 75 additional temporary driver testing posts. According to the document, the RSA has leave to employ up to 205 driver testers and at the end of May the number of full-time testers employed was 162. Some 55,996 people were waiting for their invitation to book their driving test at the end of May and a further 17,510 people had a scheduled test date. The document puts the increased demand down to factors, including an increase in learner permits in circulation, increased capacity in the Driver Theory Test, and an increase in instructors’ capacity to deliver driving lessons. In a statement, the RSA said driving test applications increased by 31 per cent in the year to date and that It has “consistently expressed the need for more permanent testers over the past two years”. It added that the recruitment panel for the 75 temporary testers “has been exhausted in 2024, given the temporary nature of these roles, particularly within high employment urban centres of Dublin and Cork, where demand for driving tests is significant”. The statement said: “Despite this, our driver testing team has continued to work extensively to address the backlog and has delivered 43 per cent more tests a year to date.” The RSA has “submitted a business case to the Department of Transport for the recruitment of new, permanent driver testers to deliver the 10-week service level against the new service demands. Until such approval of this request, it is not possible to accurately predict when the service will return to agreed service levels.”",0,1
2024/7/29,"Voting preference and refusal to send two names may leave McGrath with dud commissioner brief Ireland could be fall guy in struggle between Ursula von der Leyen and capitals over commissioner nominations There is no doubt former minister for finance Michael McGrath will be the Government’s nominee to become Ireland’s next European commissioner. The big question mark is over what job he will have when he gets to Brussels. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has made it clear she wants countries to suggest two nominees, at least one being a woman, for her to choose from when picking a team of commissioners. She formally said as much in a recent letter to the Government, but the request will have been no surprise. Von der Leyen’s desire to again put together a gender-balanced commission had been privately flagged much earlier. Ireland is standing firm and has said it will only send one name. While the choice of who to nominate is in the gift of each EU member state, it will be the commission president who decides what job they then get. EU commissioners are basically like von der Leyen’s cabinet ministers at EU-level. So you have influential positions like commissioners for trade, competition, economy or the internal market, and then portfolios with less heft, such as the commissioner for oceans and fisheries, or for international partnerships. The Government has said it is interested in a finance-related role, but so have many other countries. There are a number of things going against Ireland getting what it wants. Cabinet decided to nominate McGrath as Ireland’s next commissioner back in late June, making us one of the first out of the traps. Several countries have since followed suit and said they will also only put forward one name. If von der Leyen is looking to send a shot across the bows of the capitals by handing one of those countries a lower-rung portfolio, Ireland has positioned itself as the likely fall guy. A big part of the reason the Government moved early had to do with domestic politics. Under the coalition agreement Fianna Fáil got to pick the commissioner nominee this time. Once they had settled on McGrath, the Government had to get him out of finance with enough time for his replacement, Jack Chambers, to get his feet under the desk to prepare for the budget in October. France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and the Czech Republic are some of the others angling for finance or economic commissioner roles. Valdis Dombrovskis, the Latvian commissioner currently in the trade brief, is returning for a third stint and also has his eye on an economic job. Our current commissioner, Fine Gael’s Mairead McGuinness, is responsible for financial services, but there is a tendency to avoid countries hanging on to the same role again. It will also not be forgotten that all four of McGrath’s Fianna Fáil party colleagues in the European Parliament voted against von der Leyen in the recent vote to confirm her for a second term. In doing so they broke ranks with Renew, the centrist grouping Fianna Fáil sit within at European level, which backed the commission president. People close to the commission president describe her as someone who prizes both competency and loyalty. As a minister for public expenditure and later finance, Mr McGrath has no shortage of competency, having been a safe pair of hands at the heart of Government for several years. On the loyalty front, the votes of Fianna Fáil’s MEPs and the decision of the Government to go against von der Leyen’s request for two names will be possibly significant marks against him. There will be plenty of blame to go around if Ireland’s next commissioner is given a dud portfolio anyway.",0,1
2024/7/3,"Taoiseach urges banks to take ‘responsible approach’ to any fall in interest rates Simon Harris says he expects mortgage payments to reduce as quickly as they were raised, but accepts these are commercial decisions for banks themselves Taoiseach Simon Harris has held a series of meetings with banks, credit unions and other lenders to discuss mortgage interest rates, urging them to take a “responsible approach” to passing on falling interest rates to customers. The Taoiseach said he would like to see mortgage interest rates fall as quickly as possible, but conceded that  the issue involved a commercial decision for each bank to take. “I was keen to hold these meetings, given the importance of banking to people’s everyday lives. I know that people are still hurting due to the cost of living. Inflation has eased, but it doesn’t mean prices are coming down or it’s any easier to make ends meet.” He said he received a relatively upbeat assessment from executives on the economic situation, in addition to “limited evidence” of any increase in the number of households in mortgage arrears because of interest rate increases. “As we enter a new phase in the interest rate cycle, I want to see people feel the benefits of reduced monthly repayments as quickly as possible. I believe monthly repayments should fall just as quickly as they rose. “It is, of course, a commercial decision for each bank, reflecting their different funding arrangements, but I emphasised the need for a responsible approach – and it’s something the Government will monitor over the coming months,” he said. The Taoiseach said the demand in the mortgage market was strong at present,  adding the institutions had strongly backed the Government’s plans to build 50,000 homes per year. On his meetings with credit unions, Mr Harris said: “I’m a big supporter of the role of credit unions, so I was happy to hear their ambitious plans to expand, including growing their mortgage offerings. “While they welcomed recent legislation in this area, I will be following up several matters they raised.”",0,1
2024/7/3,"Tánaiste protests to authorities as Sean Rooney murder suspects again fail to appear in Lebanese court Young peacekeeper from Donegal serving with Unifil when his vehicle was ambushed Tánaiste Micheál Martin has protested to the Lebanese authorities over the slow pace of the investigation into the murder of Irish peacekeeper Sean Rooney after the suspects again failed to show up to court in Lebanon. The case has now been adjourned for  a seventh time, until February next year. In Ireland, gardaí, with the assistance of the Defence Forces, have now completed their own investigation into the Donegal soldier’s death for the purpose of preparing a report for the coroner. An inquest into Pte Rooney’s death is expected to take place shortly. Pte Rooney (24), was serving with the Unifil mission in Lebanon when his armoured vehicle was ambushed as it drove north through Al-Aqbiya, a town controlled by the Iranian backed Hizbullah militant group. He was killed by gunfire, while  Trooper Shane Kearney, from Killeagh, Co Cork, was seriously injured. Two other Irish troops suffered  minor injuries when the vehicle crashed. One man, Muhammad Ayyad, was later arrested and detained for allegedly taking part in the attack. He spent a year in detention before being freed by a Lebanese military court on medical grounds. Mr Ayyad failed to turn up at subsequent hearings, including most recently on June 7th, 2024. Four other accused, Hussein Salman, Ali Salman, Mustafa Salman and Ali Khalifeh, have never appeared in court, and their whereabouts are  unknown. Irish officials have voiced deep frustration  at the conduct and pace of the investigation so far. Following the June hearing, Mr Martin again contacted  Lebanese authorities to express his “unhappiness” with the situation. He has also contacted the UN. He told the Dáil he was “very disappointed” with  progress on the matter.  Progress on case was one of the main topics Mr Martin discussed with the Lebanese minister for foreign affairs, Abdallah Bou Habib, during a visit to the country in May. Taoiseach Simon Harris has also raised the matter in phone calls with Lebanese prime minister Najib Mikati.",0,1
2024/7/3,"Taoiseach plans early meeting with UK government after election to ‘reset’ relations between both islands Harris tells parliamentary meeting early engagement best to foster close relationship between Dublin and London  Taoiseach Simon Harris has said he will seek early engagement with the next British government to forge stronger relationships between the administrations on both islands. Mr Harris told the Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting that the UK election on Thursday provided an “opportunity and major moment” to reset relations with our nearest neighbour. The Taoiseach told TDs and Senators that he was not prejudging the outcome but said it was timely to seek “early engagement to discuss close, good relationships, between Ireland and the UK, in a post-Brexit environment.” It is widely expected that the Labour Party under leader Keir Starmer will win its largest majority in a century and bring to an end an unbroken period of 14 years of Conservative party rule. Mr Harris also said the Summer Economic Statement will be announced next week. He called on party colleagues to use the Summer period to present new ideas for the party to tackle the cost of living. In relation to reports on vacant childcare facilities, Mr Harris said he has asked for an audit on how many were built but never opened. Turning to the future funding of RTÉ he said a decision would be made by the end of the month. The three fundamental guiding principles, he said, were sustainability; recognising the good public service broadcasting done by all providers and not just RTÉ; and ensuring reform takes place at the national broadcaster. A motion from Deputy Michael Ring calling on the Government to exempt active farmland from the Residential Zoned Land Tax was formally adopted by the parliamentary party. Mr Ring said the tax was causing “great aggravation and upset to genuine farming families that did not want to sell their land”. At the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien told colleagues that there were now over 500 first-time buyers purchasing property each week. He said it was the highest rate since 2007. He also told colleagues there had been 52,000 commencements of homes being built between January and May this year. Party leader Micheál Martin said challenges remained in the housing sector but said that there had been many positive changes since Fianna Fáil took over the portfolio in 2020. Separately, representatives from the hospitality industry met both parties’ parliamentarians in Leinster House on Wednesday to call for the reinstatement of the 9 per cent VAT rate on food. They argued that the reduction to this rate would “stem the tide” of restaurant and cafe closures. They also said it would return long-term viability to the hospitality sector. A source who attended the meetings said both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parliamentarians gave strong support to the proposal, adding that if granted by new Minister for Finance Jack Chambers, it would be the only support package for the hospitality industry in the Budget.",0,1
2024/7/30,"Michael Ring joins Fine Gael exodus from Dáil and looks to future outside politics Decision by former minister means at least 15 of the 35 Fine Gael TDs elected in 2020 will not be seeking re-election Former Fine Gael minister Michael Ring has announced he will not be seeking re-election after three decades in the Dáil and 45 years in politics. Mr Ring (70) said “I want to see if there are other things I want to do and can do” and “I think now is the right time”. In an interview with The Irish Times he looked back at his long career and outlined his view that the election should be called in autumn with a vote transfer pact between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The Mayo TD is the latest in a series of Fine Gael politicians to announce their impending departure in recent months including former taoiseach Leo Varadkar and former tánaiste Simon Coveney. Mr Ring’s announcement means at least 15 of the 35 Fine Gael TDs elected in 2020 will not be seeking a return to the Dáil. Explaining his decision Mr Ring said: “I feel that Fine Gael with Simon Harris now [as leader], we’re in a better place than they were a number of months ago.” He had been hesitant about bowing out “because I felt Fine Gael might need all the seats they can get”. Mr Ring has been returned as a TD at every election since 1994 and he believes there is “no question” he would be re-elected if he was putting his name forward again. But he said his family “feel it’s time for me now to call it a day”, adding: “I have grandchildren and I want to spend a bit of time with them”. He was “very sick” last Christmas with pneumonia and that “kind of made me think a bit”. Mr Ring also said: “Do I want to be there at 76 years of age in the Dáil? I don’t think I do. “I’ve given it everything at both constituency level and national level.” The Westport man was first elected to the local town council in 1979 and later won a seat on Mayo County Council. He regards his “against-all-the-odds” victory in the 1994 byelection caused by local TD Pádraig Flynn departing for Brussels as Ireland’s European commissioner as one of his greatest achievements in politics. He was up against Mr Flynn’s daughter Beverley Flynn, who was expected to take the seat. Mr Ring said his win – along with then-Democratic Left politician Eric Byrne taking a seat in another byelection in Dublin – meant the numbers were there to form the Rainbow Coalition led by Fine Gael when the Fianna Fáil-Labour government that was in power at the time collapsed. When Fine Gael returned to Government in 2011 after the economic crash Mr Ring’s constituency colleague, the former taoiseach Enda Kenny, appointed him as minister of state for tourism and sport. He had a long-running local rivalry with Mr Kenny, saying: “We were like Mayo and Galway. When the match was on we belted and took swipes out of one another but when the election was over we were great friends.” As minister of state Mr Ring promoted The Gathering and Wild Atlantic Way initiative. He said “we got tourism back on its feet again”. In 2017, Mr Ring was promoted to cabinet by then taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who appointed Mr Ring to head the new Department of Rural and Community Development as its first senior minister. He said he set up several schemes designed to boost rural Ireland, such as the Town and Village Scheme and the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, and he provided funding for Tidy Towns organisations, agricultural shows and men’s and women’s sheds. Asked about the biggest change in politics since he was first elected to the Dáil, he said local radio was only just starting in 1994 and a fax machine was used to communicate between his offices in Mayo and Dublin. He added: “Then we got social media and that has been the biggest downside to civilisation – not even just to politics – social media has destroyed the world. It has destroyed people’s lives.” Mr Ring said it is “the biggest single challenge to democracy” and there needs to be “rules and regulations” brought in internationally and in Ireland as “there is a lot of fake news on it and there’ll be more and nobody will know what’s true and not true. That needs to be dealt with and dealt with quickly.” He said that under Mr Harris’ leadership of Fine Gael the party has “gone back to basics. That’s why we did so well in the local election because he listened to us on immigration, he listened to us on the other issues and I think he’s brought Fine Gael back into the middle ground again.” He said after the local election that the general election should be held in October and this view has not changed, though Mr Ring said it is “a matter for the Taoiseach and the Government”. But he said: “I fought two winter elections in February and winter elections are never simple.” Mr Harris and the other Coalition leaders have repeatedly said the intention is for the Government to complete its full term into early 2025. Mr Ring said he thought the two main parties in the Coalition will be in government together after the election and there should a “formal pact” for vote transfers between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. He did not speculate on who would replace him on the Fine Gael ticket in Mayo. Minister of State for Housing Alan Dillon will be expected to seek to retain his own seat there but Fine Gael is expected to run multiple candidates in the county. Mr Ring said: “Everyone’s replaceable, including me.”",0,1
2024/7/31,"‘Vast majority’ of future transport funding will have to be spent on public transport - Ryan Comments come as review recommends more frequent trains and new services in the northwest The “vast majority” of future funding for transport will have to be spent on public transport and active travel to achieve decarbonisation and better planning for housing, Green Party Minister for Transport and Environment Eamon Ryan has said. His remarks came as the final report of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review was published. The review recommends faster and more frequent trains, new services in the northwest, and the electrification of the intercity network among other measures. Mr Ryan said implementation of the review’s recommendations would be a political decision and one for the next Government. He said the Green Party was in favour of implementing all 32 recommendations in the review and, with a general election looming, challenged other parties to set out how much of the rail plan they would deliver. Full implementation of the recommendations up to 2050 is estimated to cost up to €37 billion with the costs shared by the two jurisdictions on the island. That would amount average spending of about €1 billion per year by the Republic over the 26 years. Asked at a press conference if that level of spending was realistic, Mr Ryan replied: “Why wouldn’t we do that?” adding that €1.5 billion per year was invested in the motorway network. He said the spending on rail would also be an investment in housing. Mr Ryan highlighted how, under the proposals, 700,000 more people would live within 5km of a railway station. “The costs come down when you see it in that way and the investment makes all the more sense. This is the future of our housing strategy as well as our transport strategy,” Mr Ryan said. The current Government agreed a two-to-one ratio of spending on public transport and active travel over roads. Asked if this ratio will have to increase, Mr Ryan said: “The vast majority of future funding in transport is going to have to go to public transport and active travel for decarbonisation, for better housing and planning, and better economic development. “This is the way everyone’s going across the world... the future is going to be public transport based.” He noted that the road network still needs investment for road safety, maintenance and to fund new projects like bypasses. Mr Ryan identified the proposal to build a new rail line from Portadown, through Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane and on to Letterkenny and Derry as one of the “most inspiring” parts of the review. He said it will be expensive, running into the billions, but it would “transform that whole part of the country and the connectivity to the northwest”. Mr Ryan also said he supports reinstating the Western Rail Corridor between Claremorris and Athenry. He challenged other political parties to “show us your colours” and say which projects they would invest in and which ones they would scrap. If the recommendations are fully implemented, the Northern Ireland Executive would end up spending about £310 million (€368 million) per year on average. However, the UK government has been making cuts to investment in rail in England and Wales. Asked if there is a danger that the route in the northwest could be jeopardised due to funding issues, Northern Ireland’s Minister for Infrastructure, Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd, said it was a mistake by the UK government to cut investment in public transport. He said he is dealing with a “very, very difficult budget in the North but we do have money, and it’s how you use that funding which is important”. “I intend to use my period in office and the limited budget I have to invest in the economy moving forward,” Mr O’Dowd said. “So yes, there are huge challenges ahead but there’s also huge opportunities if the right political decisions are made.” Mr Ryan said he is convinced there would be “strong patronage” on a new route in the northwest and he did not rule out possibilities of funding from the Republic: “We are already investing through the Shared Island fund very significantly in transport projects including the Enterprise [train service between Dublin and Belfast]. So obviously we’re going to have to continue to look at that.” Asked about the exclusion of Fermanagh from the plan, Mr O’Dowd said the “figures didn’t tally up at this stage”.

2024/7/4,"Early general election speculation takes off after Minister announces October 1st budget date Failure to go to electorate after October’s  budget giveaways would be an act of political self-harm by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party The announcement by Minister for Finance Jack Chambers that the budget is to be shifted forward by week – from the provisional date of October 8th to October 1st – has prompted a renewed flurry of speculation that the move is a prelude to an autumn general election. The timetable, or so the speculation says, goes as follows: the (large giveaway) budget is delivered on October 1st; a “bikini” finance bill (covering just the bare essentials) and a quick social welfare bill giving effect to the budget’s provisions are passed through the Dáil on an expedited timetable over the following two or three weeks; the Dáil is then dissolved by October 18th or 25th, with a three- or four-week election campaign leading up to a polling day on November 8th or 15th. All of that is eminently doable. Yes, yes, yes, Chambers assured people the Government will go its full term. The Taoiseach did the same when asked about it, as if the idea of having an early election had never crossed his mind; as if it was some sort of strange left-field idea promoted by people who spend too much time on the internet. But, the thinking goes, it will be feasible for the Coalition in the wake of the budget to say: “Our work is done. The budget is our last significant political act as a Government. There is no point in hanging around for another three months. Now it’s over to the people to decide.” Any controversy over the timing of the election would be a day-one story: the election debate would quickly move on. An early election needs a reasonable public-facing reason, which the Government could supply as per the above. Let us not forget that it’s only a few weeks since Michael McGrath told the National Economic Dialogue that the budget would be delivered as normal on October 8th. Dates can change, can’t they? The real reasons for having an early election remain as blindingly obvious to the people inside the decision-making crucible at the top of Government as they are to the rest of us outside it.  Firstly, going to the very end means not alone that you are the mercy of events with no room to manoeuvre, but that you are doing it at the time of year (February/early March) that has proved singularly disadvantageous to the last two Fine Gael-led administrations. Secondly, Sinn Féin, the Government’s chief rival, is coming off a disappointing local and European election performance in June. It is unsure of its base level of support, how many candidates it should run and where, what its message should be and whether it should portray itself as a sensible government-in-waiting or an option for radical, disruptive change. The party will answer those question after an internal process, and it will regroup – as it did before. But allowing it the minimum time possible to recover is very clearly in the interests of the Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael axis. That is why it is in the interests of the Government to have an autumn election. That is why to do otherwise would be an act of political self-harm. That is why, with the budget now moved forward, actions speak louder than words.",0,1
2024/7/4,"Chambers accused of ‘cock-and-bull story’ after insisting budget date change not election-related  Budget 2025 to take place a week sooner than expected as Minister for Finance insists autumn election not on cards Minister for Finance Jack Chambers has signalled that Budget 2025 will take place on October 1st this year, a week earlier than usual. Mr Chambers said the shift forward was “absolutely not” a signal of an early general election being planned and that the Government was “absolutely committed” to running its full term into next year. He said the move was due to meetings of euro zone and EU finance ministers taking place in Brussels on October 7th and 8th and the Government having to submit fiscal and budgetary plans to the European Commission by October 15th. Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty later described the explanation as a “cock-and-bull story”. The earlier-than-expected budget date will – if the Government wishes – make it possible to have an election in early or mid November, provided the Coalition pushes the finance and the social welfare Bills through the Dáil quickly in the first half of October. Doing so would mean the Government could call a general election on November 8th or 15th. Speculation about the Government calling an early election intensified after Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael had solid showings in the local and European elections and Sinn Féin support nosedived to a fraction of its previous strength. It is now widely expected among Government Ministers and backbenchers, and among their opponents, that the election will take place in October or November of this year. Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Taoiseach Simon Harris also denied an early general election was planned. He said the dates of the European meetings cited by Mr Chambers have been “long-known among party leaders” and this means it “makes sense to have the budget on October 1st”. “Outside of the media and political bubble, I can tell you what the people of Ireland will be much more interested in is not the date of the budget but the substance of the budget,” the Fine Gael leader said. Mr Harris said the Summer Economic Statement next week would “outline, roughly speaking, how much money we have to spend on new initiatives next year and also how much we will have for our tax package too.” Speaking in the Dáil, Mr Doherty told Mr Chambers his comments about the budget being moved forward because of a calendar clash with EU meetings was a “cock-and-bull story”. Accusing the Government of “taking the public for fools”, Mr Doherty said he has been his party’s finance spokesman for 14 years and the September tax receipts have always been “crucial to the formation of the budget”.  He told Mr Chambers not to pretend that the change of date was “for anything other than to potentially pave the way for an early election”. In response, Mr Chambers said Mr Doherty was “a complete contradiction” given he and his party have regularly called for a general election to take place. “We’re actually committed to political stability and running our full term,” he said. “And again you dismiss a European meeting ... and that shows your Euroscepticism.”",0,1
2024/7/4,"Buoyant tax returns likely to fuel political demands for giveaway budget Pressure likely to mount on Chambers and Donohoe to be generous as corporation tax receipts up 15 per cent on last year Surging corporation and income tax receipts have boosted the State’s financial position, handing the Government the means to deliver a giveaway budget before the next general election. Despite repeated warnings about the potential volatility of multinational profits, corporation tax receipts have continued to grow, with half-year exchequer returns published on Wednesday showing the tax generated €5.9 billion in June, up by €1.6 billion, or 38 per cent, on the same month last year. Corporation tax receipts for the year now stand at €12.2 billion, up €1.6 billion (15 per cent) on the same period last year. The June receipts generally reflect companies with financial years ending in December which include several big players in the tech sector here, among them Google, Meta, Microsoft and Intel. Overall, the latest exchequer numbers show the Government took in a total of €44.7 billion in tax across all headings in the six months to the end of June, up some €3.8 billion or 9 per cent on the same period last year. Senior Government figures acknowledged the buoyant tax returns were likely to fuel political demands on Minister for Finance Jack Chambers and Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe for a big giveaway in the autumn budget. The first indications of that will be when the two Ministers deliver the Summer Economic Statement next week, which will set the fiscal parameters for Budget 2025. Speaking to The Irish Times on Wednesday, a number of Government backbenchers indicated several areas in which they would be seeking extra spending. Veteran Fine Gael TD Charlie Flanagan called for cuts in inheritance tax and investment in defence, while his colleague Brendan Griffin said he would be seeking the restoration of the 9 per cent VATrate for the hospitality industry as well as a reduction in universal social charge. Fianna Fáil’s Cormac Devlin said he wanted to see a tax package for workers, an increase in the State pension and supports to deal with continuing cost-of-living pressures. However, it is around the Cabinet table that Mr Chambers and Mr Donohoe will feel the fiercest pressure for spending increases and tax cuts as Ministers prepare to pitch their requests for departmental spending hikes. On Tuesday night, in a statement issued after a meeting with representatives of the banking industry, Taoiseach Simon Harris pledged further cost-of-living supports. “The Government will continue to help with the cost of living, with more measures to take effect in September and to be announced in the forthcoming budget,” he said. Speaking at the publication of the figures, Mr Chambers said June was a key month for tax revenues and the strong performance was a “welcome indicator” of the health of the economy. “That said, there has been considerable volatility – in both directions – in corporation tax revenues over the last number of months, underlying the need to treat around half of these receipts as windfall in nature,” he said. Government coffers were also buoyed by strong income tax receipts, which generated €2.8 billion in June and €16.7 billion for the year so far, €1.2 billion higher than the same period last year. VAT receipts, an indicator of consumer spending, were €11 billion for the six-month period, 6.2 per cent higher than last year.",0,1
2024/7/6,"NI Secretary Hilary Benn promises to form new relationship between UK government and Stormont Mr Benn was speaking after meeting with Stormont leaders Michelle O’Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly New Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn has said his priority is to establish a new relationship between the UK government and Stormont’s powersharing Executive. Mr Benn was speaking after hosting a meeting with Northern Ireland’s First Minister, Michelle O’Neill, and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly at Hillsborough Castle in Co Down on Saturday evening. Mr Benn also met representatives of the Stormont parties during his first visit to the region since taking up the role. “I wanted to get to work as quickly as possible and was therefore pleased to be able to hold these initial discussions with the First and Deputy First Ministers and representatives from the other parties,” Mr Benn said. “My immediate priorities are to establish a new relationship between the UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive as we work together to foster economic growth and prosperity, and to improve public services. “I want to ensure that we have a system in place for addressing the legacy of the past in a way that wins support from victims’ families and that all communities can have confidence in, and which is compliant with human rights.” Mr Benn had been serving as the Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary since 2023 and was chairman of the House of Commons’ Brexit select committee for years. The Leeds MP was among new British prime minister Keir Starmer’s cabinet appointees. Mr Starmer and Mr Benn have previously said a Labour government would repeal the controversial Legacy Act, introduced by the Tories to address Troubles legacy issues and widely opposed by all the main political parties in Northern Ireland. Mr Benn was also vocal in urging the powersharing institutions to be revived during the three-year hiatus. He takes over from the Conservatives’ Chris Heaton-Harris, who has been in the role for almost two years and did not contest the recent UK general election. Mr Benn said that the new UK government was firmly committed to the 1998 Belfast Agreement. “We will work hard to deliver its vision for reconciliation, equality, respect for rights and parity of esteem,” Mr Benn said. The Northern Ireland Secretary said his meeting with Ms O’Neill and Ms Little-Pengelly was “very constructive”. “I look forward to building on our relationship in the months ahead,” he said. Mr Starmer has already said he will visit Northern Ireland during his first days in office. Mr Benn said he also had a phone call with Tánaiste Micheál Martin on Friday. “As our nearest neighbour and co-guarantor of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, our relationship with Ireland is of great importance,” Mr Benn said. “The new UK government will work closely with the Irish Government to reset and strengthen the relationship between our two countries.” – PA",0,1
2024/7/7,"All-Ireland winning manager and former Fine Gael TD John O’Mahony dies aged 71  O’Mahony managed Galway senior football team to All-Ireland titles in 1998 and 2001  The death has occurred at 71 of All-Ireland winning manager John O’Mahony, one of the most influential figures in modern football. Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader Simon Harris was among those who paid tribute to the former TD and Senator, saying Mr O’Mahony was “a true gentleman who will be greatly missed”. From Kilmovee in Mayo, Mr O’Mahony settled in Ballaghaderreen, where he was a schoolteacher in the local St Nathy’s and was involved in the town’s GAA club. During his playing career, he won a minor All-Ireland medal in 1971 and his first management impact came 12 years later when he led Mayo to All-Ireland under-21 success in 1983. His senior managerial career involved a litany of achievements including bringing Mayo to a first senior All-Ireland final in 38 years (1989); Leitrim winning a first Connacht championship in 67 years (1994); and leading Galway to a first Sam Maguire since for 32 years in 1998 and another in 2001. A friendly and understated man, Mr O’Mahony brought intelligence and empathy to the process of team building and preparation – for instance being an early adopter of the inclusion of sports psychology and performance coaching with his teams. He took over Mayo for a second term in 2007 and won the Connacht championship in 2009. By that stage, he had become a TD for Mayo, elected in 2007 and re-elected in 2011. He served in the Seanad from 2016 to 2020. In recent years, he had been unwell with cancer but had made a recovery. He had been hospitalised with an infection in the past few weeks and although apparently getting better, he died on Saturday with his family present. The week before last he spoke on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland about the death of his close friend Tommie Gorman, who had collaborated with him in his various management roles, producing motivational material for the teams as well as video analysis. They had been intending to bring former Dublin manager Jim Gavin to an arts festival in August and had targeted that as a deadline for getting out of their respective hospitals. In a eulogy, Tommie’s son Joe said his father “loved that his friend John O’Mahony brought in a sports psychologist as the Leitrim manager in the early 90s, then Tommie as a video analyst, because John didn’t accept a lack of ambition. John believed”. He is survived by his wife Gerardine Towey and five daughters: Gráinne, Niamh, Rhona, Deirdre and Clíodhna. The Taoiseach said Mr O’Mahony was “without a doubt one of the GAA’s finest” managers and that he had an “exceptional career” in sport and politics. “He was an amiable, decent man and will be a big loss,” he said. “An outstanding politician, he always ensured Mayo and the west of Ireland was well represented.”",0,1
2024/7/7,"Next generation will ‘never forgive us’ if Anglo-Irish relations not repaired, Taoiseach says New British PM Keir Starmer says he looks forward to ‘working closely’ with Simon Harris after years of post-Brexit strain The Government and the new Labour administration in the UK have an opportunity to reset what has been a difficult relationship in recent years and the next generation will “never forgive us” if they fail to do so, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. Mr Harris moved quickly once the outcome of the British general election became known on Friday to contact prime minister Keir Starmer. It is part of an effort to repair relations between Dublin and London which have been strained by protracted wrangling over Brexit and Northern Ireland’s status outside the EU. “At the end of the day, we’re neighbours, we’re friends; in many cases we’re family as well,” Mr Harris said in an interview with Sky News.  “There’s an opportunity now, a real opportunity that we must seize and the next generation will never forgive us if we don’t press reset and say: ‘Yes it’s been a difficult few years, but you know what? We have so much more in common than divides us’.” He said Ireland and the UK should work together to “fulfil the promise of the Good Friday Agreement” which he said was “very much in the DNA of the British Labour Party”. Mr Harris acknowledged there had been “clear policy differences and difficulties and challenges” between the UK and Ireland in the years since Brexit, but the Taoiseach said he was eager to work with Mr Starmet to repair relations. Shortly after his appointment as prime minister, Mr Starmer had a telephone conversation with the Taoiseach and invited him to visit Downing Street on July 17th. Mr Harris on Sunday said the British-Irish relationship is “really strong” and the two islands have “many issues of mutual concern”. In a post on X replying to Mr Harris, Mr Starmer said: “An Anglo-Irish partnership can offer great opportunities to both our nations. Looking forward to working closely with you.” The Taoiseach said one of the priorities of his meeting with Mr Starmer later this month would be discussing ways of improving the structures for engagement between Britain and Ireland following Brexit. “It used to be that whoever the Irish taoiseach and British prime minister was would meet regularly through their membership of the European Union,” he said. “Those structures obviously aren’t there now. I respect that fact. But we do need to look for new ways of making sure that regular engagement happens.” Mr Harris said people did not need a history lesson over why the relationship has been difficult in recent years. “Obviously, Brexit did make life challenging and challenging in relation to the relationship between the two islands and also, I suppose, changed that in many ways because no longer will be two countries within the European Union,” he said.` “The fact that we now have a new British prime minister and indeed a new Irish Taoiseach does present a real opportunity for both of us, both myself and the prime minister, to dig deep in terms of resetting Anglo-Irish relations.”",0,1
2024/7/7,"Keir Starmer due in Belfast ahead of meetings with political leaders on Monday UK’s new Prime Minister says rebuilding public services and generating economic growth in NI a priority Britain’s new prime minister Keir Starmer is due in Belfast on Sunday night ahead of meetings with political leaders on Monday on his first official visit to the North since Labour’s election victory. He will meet the first and deputy first ministers, Michelle O’Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly, at Stormont, where they are expected to discuss issues including Casement Park, the controversial Legacy Act and future funding arrangements for Northern Ireland. Mr Starmer will then meet Executive and Opposition politicians at Parliament Buildings. Speaking ahead of his visit, Mr Starmer said “stability and long-term certainty will be at the centre of everything my government does for Northern Ireland, working with all communities, political parties, and with respect to all traditions. “We are the party of the Good Friday Agreement, and the stability it has brought,” he said. “Together, as we take the steps towards a decade of national renewal, we will harness Northern Ireland’s vast economic strengths – rebuilding strong public services and generating real and tangible economic growth for working people. “We must turn the page and secure investment, prosperity, and stability for future generations to come,” the prime minister said. Earlier on Sunday the Northern Secretary, Hilary Benn, emphasised his government’s determination to reset relationships between London and Dublin in his first press conference in Belfast since his appointment. He said the prime minister was “very, very committed to a new relationship with the Irish government and to progress and to the [powersharing] institutions being successful” in Northern Ireland. Mr Benn, who was appointed to the Northern brief following Labour’s landslide victory in the UK general election last week, met Ms O’Neill and Ms Little-Pengelly and other political representatives on Saturday in meetings viewed as constructive and positive. He also spoke to the Tánaiste, Micheál Martin, by phone on Friday in a conversation described by sources as “warm” and it is understood the two plan to meet in person soon. On Sunday morning Mr Benn met traders and stallholders during a walkabout at St George’s Market in Belfast before taking questions from the media. In a half-hour session that touched on a number of priorities for the new government, the Northern Secretary said the redevelopment of west Belfast GAA ground Casement Park was “probably the most urgent issue on my desk” and pledged the project would go ahead. “If it’s possible, in time for the Euros, if not, one way or another, Casement Park will have to be built,” he said. On the controversial Troubles Legacy Act, which Labour has committed to “repeal and replace”, the Northern Secretary acknowledged the opposition to it in Northern Ireland and said the provision for an amnesty had already been disapplied as a result of a High Court judgment. However, he indicated that the work of the ICRIR – the investigative body set up by the legislation – may continue, saying it was “now in existence” but would “have to demonstrate to victims’ families” it can provide answers. “I would want to look at the governance arrangements surrounding the commission because of the way in which the Legacy Act came into being,” he said, later adding: “Does it make sense to totally scrap the commission? I don’t think it does.” Mr Benn said he was committed to working with all of the parties, and with the Irish Government in view of the interstate case, to try to find a way forward that will command more support. “I can’t promise it will command the support of everybody, but at the moment it has ... the support of nobody, and that is another urgent task we will get on and work with as soon as possible.” Asked about the possibility of a Border poll, Mr Benn said the criteria in the Belfast Agreement was “very clear” and there was “no evidence that condition has been met”. He said he would not set out further criteria because the existing agreement “speaks for itself”. Therefore, he said, “I think it’s off into the distance myself because of what I have seen about opinion here in Northern Ireland at the moment.”",0,1
2024/7/8,"UL professor Stephen Kinsella to be appointed economics adviser to Taoiseach Simon Harris Mr Kinsella will balance the role with his commitments to the University of Limerick, while taking a break from journalism Prof Kinsella is expected to be confirmed for the position this week, which he will take up on a part-time basis balancing his commitments to UL.  The appointment was flagged by The Irish Times before Mr Harris was formally elected Taoiseach in March, but it took some weeks before an agreement was reached between the parties. The Dublin native, who is head of the Department of Economics at UL, is expected to take on a role similar to the one played by Prof Alan Ahearne with Tánaiste Micheál Martin, who advises on a part-time basis. His involvement will increase in advance of significant events in the fiscal calendar such as the Summer Economic Statement and the budget in the autumn. Prof Kinsella is also known for his journalism, writing with the Irish Independent and the Sunday Business Post before joining online publisher The Currency as chief economics writer. He is expected to step back from writing temporarily while working for Government Buildings. He has also written for The Guardian and The New York Times. Prof John McHale, who formerly chaired the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, had also been linked to the position. Prof Kinsella is a member of the Artificial Intelligence Advisory Council and chairs the external advisory board to the Government’s Economic Evaluation Service and is a board member of the Parliamentary Budget Office external advisory board.  He was a member of the research subgroup of the Expert Advisory Group of the National Public Health Emergency Team between 2020 and 2021, and was a board member of the Higher Education Authority for three years to 2017.",0,1
2024/7/8,"UK will act as ‘honest broker’ on question of Border poll, says Starmer New British prime minister, however, makes no firm policy commitments as he meets party leaders in Belfast The British government under Labour will act as an “honest broker” in relation to any future Border poll on a united Ireland, prime minister Keir Starmer has said. Speaking in the Great Hall of Stormont’s Parliament Buildings on Monday on his first visit to Northern Ireland since his party’s landslide victory in the UK general election, Mr Starmer made no firm policy commitments on the North – just 48 hours after his Northern Secretary Hilary Benn rejected calls for a Border poll. However, Mr Starmer pledged to build “respectful” relationships between the London and Dublin governments following the instability of the “last six to eight years”. In what was his third day in office, Mr Starmer met Sinn Féin First Minister Michelle O’Neill and DUP deputy first minster Emma Little-Pengelly before holding brief discussions with delegations from the North’s five main parties. Addressing the media, he described the meetings as “positive and constructive” before reaffirming his commitment to “resetting relationships” with politicians on both sides of the Border. “I have been very clear that my government has a mandate for change, for stability here in Northern Ireland and a different way of doing politics,” he told reporters. During a visit to the North last year, Mr Starmer dismissed the possibility of a Border poll in the next decade and said it was “not even on the horizon”. Pressed on the issue on Monday, he softened his tone a little, saying: “This is provided for by the Good Friday Agreement. The framework is set out and I’m absolutely committed to the Good Friday Agreement. “Today is a recommitment to that and to the approach and the role of the UK government in that as the honest broker.” On Saturday, during his first round of meetings in Belfast as Northern Secretary, Mr Benn said the criteria for a Border poll was “very clear” in the Belfast Agreement and there was “no evidence that condition has been met”. Mr Starmer was asked about the controversial Troubles Legacy Act, which the Labour Party vowed to “repeal and replace” as part of their election manifesto. The prime minister would not be drawn on whether he would request the Irish Government to drop the interstate case it lodged in the European Court of Human Rights against the previous UK administration. The most contentious part of the legislation, an amnesty for perpetrators of Trouble-related killings and crimes, was deemed unlawful by the Belfast High Court in March – but a truth recovery commission remains in place. “I have already had discussions with the Taoiseach (Simon Harris) and others, again to make it clear the approach I will take to reset and make sure those relationships are collaborative, that they are respectful,” Mr Starmer said. Before the press conference, party leaders spoke about their respective morning meetings with Mr Starmer, with each endorsing his appointment. Ms McDonald described him as a “sensible person” and said the difference in dealing with the new Labour government compared to the previous Conservative government, was like the difference between “daylight and dark”. Among the issues discussed was funding for the Casement Park redevelopment in west Belfast in advance of the 2028 Euro games and public funding for the North’s frontline services. “We expect to see progress on that matter (Casement) in the near future,” Ms McDonald said. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long also said they had positive discussions and again contrasted relations with the previous government, which she said had left a “very toxic legacy”. DUP leader Gavin Robinson said Mr Starmer – who had spent five years working in Northern Ireland as a human rights adviser to the NI Policing Board – knows “what makes this place tick”.",0,1
2024/7/9,"Billions set aside for budget - but much of the spending is running to stand still Minister for Finance Jack Chambers did not betray any inexperience during the Summer Economic Statement, but October will be the true test It may have been the Summer Economic Statement but from a political perspective there were two big considerations. The first was: are we in line for a giveaway budget? And the second: how is Jack Chambers scrubbing up as Minister for Finance? Chambers and Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe repeatedly said the budget on October 1st would not be an “election budget”. But the headline figures suggest otherwise, at first glance. The overall budgetary package will come to a lofty €8.3 billion in terms of tax cuts and spending. For the first time, total expenditure by the State will surpass €100 billion in 2025 – €6.9 billion higher than in 2024. But once we drill down into the figures, a lot of the extra expenditure is “running to keep still” money. A total of €5.1 billion in additional spending is required next year to meet existing costs and commitments: including the public sector pay deal (€1.2 billion); an extra €1.5 billion for the HSE in 2024 (and a further €1.2 billion for 2025). There is, nonetheless, room for manoeuvre for a Government facing into an election. Chambers’ tax package will be €1.4 billion and Donohoe will also have some discretion from the €6.9 billion allotted for current and capital spending. It’s unlikely that we will see a third tax rate being introduced, rather changes in the tax thresholds aimed to avoid “fiscal drag” for low- and middle-income earners. “The key objective is to help avoid a situation where workers pay a higher percentage of income as earnings grow,” said Chambers. Most of the indications in advance of the budget look positive. There are 2.8 million people working. Unemployment is 4.5 per cent. Inflation dropped to 1.5 per cent in June, the lowest since 2021. Corporation tax remains buoyant despite the constant warnings of its fickle nature. The other outstanding item is the mammoth €4.5 billion that will be provided in 2025 for contingencies – at the moment, that is providing accommodation for Ukrainian refugees and international protection applicants. As we have seen during the summer elections, that issue has also become politicised. As for Jack Chambers, if there remains a deficit in his wherewithal for such a senior position, he did not betray it during the hour-long press conference. He looked a little nervous at times but clearly had his homework done. He even appropriated the lingo, speaking at one stage of putting money aside for “countercyclical interventions”. Asked if he was confident he had the ability to deliver the budget, he insisted his experience having spent four years in Cabinet would stand to him. October 1st will be the test of that.",0,1
2024/7/9,"Cloud on the horizon as politicians take summer break Autumn general election seems likely as Coalition prepares for final budget It’s the last week of the current Dáil term, with the long hot summer stretching out in front of the current crop of parliamentarians. Except it’s not hot, the forecast is for teeming rain much of the day, and the cloud on the horizon is a likely autumn general election to keep everyone on their toes, with the small matter of the Government’s last budget in between. Thank god for those rainy day funds, right? Today’s main business will be the lunchtime publication of the summer Economic Statement, which sets the broad parameters for the budget. The three Coalition leaders met late into the evening on Monday with the finance ministers Jack Chambers and Paschal Donohoe to thrash out the final agreement. Details of what it will contain are thin on the ground - but it looks like a tax package north of €1.1 billion, for starters. We hear the top brass were at it so late that Taoiseach Simon Harris had to cancel a jaunt to the US Ambassador’s 4th July party in the Phoenix Park. It says something about the rapid personnel changes in the coalition that at last night’s meeting, new finance minister Jack Chambers (appointed 13 days ago) was not even the person in the room most recently in a new job (Roderic O’Gorman, elected Green Party earlier that morning). All this change will take time to gel; what we don’t know is what the outworkings of these changes will be in the final months before an election. Chambers has stuck to the script since his elevation, urging caution and prudence, seeking to temper expectations - in fact, one Fianna Fáil minister went so far as to argue privately yesterday that in the face of budgetary kite flying, fiscal restraint should become part of the Fianna Fáil brand (“part of our selling point is fiscal prudence,” this minister said). Whether that survives contact with the backbenchers is another matter. Here’s what we can glean about the SES, and what else is going to cabinet today: Some in Fianna Fáil believe Fine Gael are already planning to pin any dashed budget promises on Chambers - particularly if no lower VAT rate for the hospitality sector is signed off. The jockeying for political position over the coming months will be something to behold. Where O’Gorman fits into all this is another known unknown: there will be no ministerial overhaul, and as Pat Leahy writes today, O’Gorman is the continuity candidate from Eamon Ryan. However, continuity is unlikely to cut it if the Green Party is to convince voters beyond its base that it deserves their votes. The Dublin West TD indicated yesterday that he wanted to show people how Green policies could help and support people in their daily lives - but which policies, at what cost, and how forceful will he have to be to ensure they are branded as Green? Keir Starmer was in Belfast yesterday and as our Northern editor Freya McClements writes, it was all smiles and a clear change of tone. The dust continues to settle on those extraordinary French elections. Read Jack Power’s two analysis pieces on what comes next here and here. Brexit was notable by its relative absence from the UK general election campaign, but Fintan O’Toole says Keir Starmer needs to put caution aside and start tackling the elephant in the room.

2024/7/9,"Taoiseach says carers and elderly to be among Government priorities in budget Following ‘intensive’ talks more would be done on spending side than through tax cuts, says Taoiseach Carers, the elderly and those with disabilities will be a priority for the Government in the upcoming budget, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. Speaking on his arrival at Tuesday morning’s Cabinet meeting at Government Buildings, Mr Harris said there had been a number of “very intensive” engagements between the Coalition party leaders and Minister for Finance Jack Chambers and Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe. He would not be drawn on the split between taxation and spending measures, but said the budget would provide “real and practical assistance” to working families and working people. He also said “significant support” would be targeted at older people, carers and those with a disability. “These will be priorities for us in the weeks ahead,” he said. Mr Harris said that in keeping with recent years, more would be done on the spending side than through tax cuts, but that it was important to keep pace with rising incomes and deliver a tax package which ensures people do not move into higher bands of taxation while they were still coping with rising prices. He said investment in new long-term climate and infrastructure funds was important but that while inflation had come down, it has done so from an extremely high level and “people are still hurting”. “It’s a balance between protecting our economy ... but also recognising that we live in a society where people are still hurting.” Against the backdrop of exchequer figures released last year which showed the total tax take had increased by nine per cent relative to the same period in 2023, Mr Harris said every budget when the economy was doing well “does try to give back people some of their own money” while also supporting those in society who need it most and that would be the approach taken. He said it would be an expansionary budget but would safeguard the future of the country. Senior sources on the Fianna Fáil side of Government were keen to play down the prospects of a restoration to the 9 per cent VAT rate for hospitality, saying that it would take up “half the entire tax package”, which it expected to be in the region of €1.4 billion when the budget is announced. Instead they point to a tax package to be delivered by Mr Chambers that is likely to concentrate on lower and middle earners, with indexation of the tax bands and possibly cuts to USC using up the bulk of the available money. Mr Chambers and Mr Donohoe are to host a press conference on the publication of the Government’s Summer Economic Statement later.",0,1
2024/7/9,"People Before Profit seeking formal left-wing voting pact with Sinn Féin ahead of next election Dublin TD says parties must ‘come together to learn from what has happened in France’ in call for agreement Dublin South-West TD Paul Murphy told reporters at Leinster House on Tuesday that he has written to the Sinn Féin president seeking talks with the party and others on the left to “come together to learn from what has happened in France” and “to establish a left front here to go into the next election”. He said that the current polling trajectory and the outcome of the local and European elections suggests that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will be returned to Government, supported by Independents or the centre-left. “We think that would be a missed opportunity in terms of where the polls have been at for most of the period since the last general election, and we think there’s lessons to learn from France,” he said. He called for a clear vote left/transfer left official pact between parties, a commonly agreed radical programme and a commitment from participants not to go into Coalition with Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. “People’s disappointments and cynicism about politics, a big part of that comes from the fact that in the past, they’re voting for change, for example, for the Greens or Labour Party, and their votes have ended up putting Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael back in power,” he said. An additional red line would be a commitment not to “engage in a scapegoating of asylum seekers” and instead to “stand in solidarity with asylum seekers and to try and unite people regardless of what colour they are, regardless of what county they come from, against those who are actually responsible for the housing crisis and for the health crisis”. Sinn Féin were seen by many commentators as having pivoted to the right on migration before the election – with Mr Murphy saying on Tuesday that he did believe the party had scapegoated migrants. “I think Sinn Féin made a very, very big mistake, both morally and politically in the run up to the election,” he said, adding that the strategy had “backfired” and that there are “lots of people within Sinn Féin, who know that what they did in the run of the local and European elections was an absolute disaster because they ended up playing the election on the pitch and the Government wanted to play it on.”",0,1
2024/7/9,"Taoiseach to appoint Donegal disability campaigner to Seanad Nikki Bradley, a cancer survivor, is a motivational speaker who works with disability organisations Taoiseach Simon Harris is to appoint disability campaigner and motivational speaker Nikki Bradley to the Seanad to succeed former Seanad leader Regina Doherty who won a European Parliament seat in Dublin for Fine Gael. Ms Bradley is a disability advocate and a survivor of Ewing’s Sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer, which was diagnosed when she was 16. In 2022 her leg was amputated as a result of the condition. A motivational speaker, she has work with some of Ireland’s leading disability organisations including Active Disability Ireland, The Disabled Drivers Association, of which she is a board member, and The No Barriers Foundation. The Taoiseach has put disability as one of his priorities during his tenure and the appointment is expected to give a voice for people with disabilities in Leinster House. Ms Bradley is from Co Donegal which has no female TDs in the Oireachtas, and could be a prospective Fine Gael candidate in the general election to hold the seat being vacated by Joe McHugh, who has said he won’t stand. She has a website The Motivation Factory, and is the founder of Fighting Fit for Ewing’s which raises awareness about the disease and encourages participation in physical challenges. The Donegal native engages in significant physical challenges, including becoming the first crutch user to climb four Irish mountains in less than 32 hours in 2018. She has climbed the Solheimajokull glacier in Iceland, The Sturrall sea cliffs in Donegal, which she abseiled off, and trekked through the Brecon Beacons in Wales, relying on crutches for each challenge.

2024/8/1,"Income tax cuts a ‘core part’ of Budget 2025 package, says Jack Chambers The Minister for Finance also signalled that consideration will be given to inheritance tax cuts which he said is ‘a significant imposition on many families’ Income tax reductions will be a “core part” of the tax package in the Budget according to Minister for Finance Jack Chambers. He also said inheritance tax is “a significant imposition on many families” signalling that consideration will be given to cuts in that tax. And Mr Chambers said the Government is looking at how families can continue to be supported with the cost-of-living over the winter when asked about the prospect of the reduced VAT rate on electricity and gas being extended. His remarks came as he announced the commencement of two-long term funds designed to protect future State investment in public services and infrastructure. He was asked about a series of possible Budget 2025 measures during a press conference at Government Buildings. Mr Chambers said “a core part of our tax package will be to put money back in people’s pockets and reduce the income tax burden for families.” He said highlight previous measures related to USC – which has seen cuts to the rates and changes to thresholds – and he said “they’re part of our wider consideration around income tax”. The chances of a renewed cut of the VAT rate for the hospitality industry to 9 per cent seem remote with Mr Chambers saying the Government is prioritising income tax cuts. Asked about this issue he said: “a core part of our tax package will be to support reductions in income tax and support the over two million people in our economy, who are working who are paying high levels of income tax presently, and we really want to give them a break in 2025.” Mr Chambers said: “That leaves additional scope for other taxation measures, but not enormous scope”. The rate for Capital Acquisition Tax (CAT), better known as inheritance tax, currently stands at 33 per cent on inheritance over €335,000. Taoiseach Simon Harris said recently that “unfairness” and “anomalies” relating to inheritance tax were issues that deserve to be considered in advance of the budget while Tánaiste Micheál Martin described it as “punitive”. The recent Tax Strategy Group papers published by the Department of Finance set out how raising the parent-to-child threshold of €335,000 to €350,000 would cost just €15 million while raising it to €400,000 would cost €52 million. On inheritance tax Mr Chambers said: “capital acquisitions tax is a significant imposition on many families and there are specific circumstances that I know have been really difficult for families in recent years, particularly as property prices have risen.” The VAT rate on gas and electricity bills was reduced from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent in May 2022 as part of Government efforts to help households with the cost of living. The reduced rate is due to expire on October 31st. Asked about the possibility of the lower rate being extended Mr Chamber said: “I fully understand that for many families the cost-of-living is still a central issue”. He added that the reduced VAT rate “will be considered in the context of Budget 2025, particularly during the winter period and how we can continue to support families during that time.” Mr Chambers this week signed the commencement order to officially establish the Future Ireland Fund and Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund. The Future Ireland Fund, which has potential to grow to around €100bn by 2040 is designed to help with future public spending pressures surrounding an ageing population, climate and digitalisation.",0,1
2024/8/1,"Progress on introducing e-cigarette tax ‘likely’ in budget, Chambers says Recent Tax Strategy Group (TSG) papers published by the Department of Finance outline challenges surrounding such a tax There is “likely to be progress” on an e-cigarette tax in the upcoming budget, Minister for Finance Jack Chambers has said, though he stopped short of definitively saying one will be introduced next year. His predecessor, Michael McGrath, last year announced a proposal to introduce a tax on e-cigarettes and vapes. The recent Tax Strategy Group papers published by the Department of Finance outlined challenges surrounding such a tax. Mr Chambers said it was his intention “to make progress” on the tax in this year’s budget and there was ongoing work “on how we can operationalise that”. He said he wanted to “follow through” on Mr McGrath’s commitment and “the technicalities are being worked through on how we can make that possible for 2025”. Mr McGrath said in last year’s budget that he was proposing the tax “in light of public health interests” and amid continuing delays to the revision of the EU Tobacco Products Tax Directive. The battery-powered devices turn an “e-liquid” into an aerosol that is inhaled by the user. Such e-liquids may or may not contain nicotine. The Tax Strategy Group papers said vapes were “not harm free” and “often contain many of the chemicals found in traditional cigarettes”. “Given the difficulties in determining whether e-liquids contain nicotine and the level of nicotine they may contain, it may be most effective to apply a tax to all e-liquids, regardless of nicotine content,” the papers said. Vapes are used by some people who are trying to quit smoking and the strategy group said any tax must strike a balance to ensure that such products were not priced “at a level that pushes people into the consumption of traditional tobacco products”. The papers said the Revenue Commissioners could face a challenge enforcing such a tax due to the size of the products, which they noted “are easily portable and may be difficult to detect from a customs perspective”.",0,1
2024/8/11,"Sipo reconsidering its stance on Leo Varadkar leak inquiry Ethics body writes to PBP deputy Paul Murphy telling him it will inform him of the outcome of its reconsideration The Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) is reconsidering its position in relation to the leaking of a confidential document by Leo Varadkar in 2019. In a letter to People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy last week the ethics body has said it has commenced a reconsideration of the matter and will inform him of the outcome. Deputy Murphy complained about the leak to Sipo in 2020 but the body decided not to conduct a preliminary inquiry. That decision was then challenged in the High Court by Mr Murphy, with the court ruling in June that the decision was “inadequately reasoned”. It now appears that Sipo can return with the same decision not to conduct a preliminary inquiry, but give more adequate reasoning for its decision, or come to an alternative decision and conduct a preliminary inquiry. It is not clear if such a full investigation could be concluded before the general election. Mr Varadkar has announced he is leaving politics at the end of this Dáil. “I think they should hold an investigation and I think this should happen before a general election,” said Mr Murphy. “I think the people have the right to know if he did something wrong, and if Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and the Greens were correct in backing him.” A spokesman for Sipo said he had no comment to make. It was not possible to contact Mr Varadkar. The leak, of a proposed new contract with GPs by the then Taoiseach, led to a no-confidence vote which Mr Varadkar survived. It also led to a Garda investigation, after which the Director of Public Prosecutions decided no charges should be brought. The Garda investigation put the Sipo consideration of the matter on temporary hold. At the time of the High Court decision Mr Varadkar said it was a matter for Sipo to decide whether it would give more detailed reasons or reassess the complaint from scratch.",0,1
2024/8/12,"Funding for Irish athletes and facilities before next Olympic Games to top €500m Running track and national velodrome and badminton centre among plans, but swimming pools ‘shockingly expensive’ says Minister Funding for Irish athletes and facilities in advance of the next Olympic Games will top €500 million following the great success of Team Ireland in Paris, the Minister responsible for sports policy has said. Thomas Byrne, Minister of State for Sport said that spending to support high-performance athletes and teams could reach €120 million cumulatively over the next four years, with a further €400 million being allotted in funding for new stadiums and world-standard facilities. The State has supported Irish Olympic athletes to unprecedented levels in recent years, said Mr Byrne, but would continue to increase funding for the Los Angeles games in 2028, and for sports generally. Referring specifically to Sport Ireland’s high-performance programme, he said he wanted to increase its funding from €25 million a year to as much as €30 million a year over the next four years. “Funding for high performance alone has gone up by 50 per cent as compared to the last Olympic cycle, increasing from €59 million to €89 million. We are going to increase it more for the Los Angeles cycle,” he said. “We’re also going to be announcing a new programme of spending under the sports capital programme in September. In 2019 the sports capital programme was worth about €59 million. In 2022 it was €166 million. This new sports capital programme will be at least €250 million when we announce it in September.” “In addition, we have a separate fund of €120 million for large-scale sports infrastructure, which would be mainly stadiums and regional sports centres.” Mr Byrne said that there has been a step-change in recent years, with sporting organisations now having access to significant funding for development and improving standards. “We have authorised Sports Ireland to go to tender on the new national velodrome [for track cycling], which will also have a national badminton centre [with 12 courts]. The velodrome and badminton centre, which will be located at Sport Ireland Campus in Dublin, could cost upwards of €60 million. The campus will also be the location for new cricket facilities ahead of the Cricket World Cup in 2030 that Ireland is co-hosting. “We are providing really significant amounts of facilities to sports clubs and organisation up and down the country. For example, there is a state-of-the-art running track being constructed in Bandon, the home of [athlete] Phil Healy.” Tánaiste Micheál Martin said on Sunday that the Government would in 2024 alone be announcing €400 million in capital investments for sports. He said the turnaround in the fortunes of the Irish Olympic team was the result of good governance by Sport Ireland and the Olympic Federation of Ireland in recent years. “When you get good governance, you get incremental increases in investment, there’s better confidence all round, proper processes. That is far more important in my view, because good governance will attract more funding and the funding gets targeted in the proper way.” Mr Byrne, however, said that there were still obvious gaps. He said there was a need for more first-class swimming pools but the costs being quoted for some were “shockingly expensive”. He said that he hoped that some of those projects would come through as part of the large-scale sports infrastructure funds. He said that there was also a focus on looking at improving soccer facilities, including those in the League of Ireland. The 133 athletes who competed for Ireland in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games will be welcomed home on Monday, with a public homecoming in front of the GPO, O’Connell Street, Dublin beginning at 12.30pm. The 64 women and 69 men competed across 14 sports, winning a total of seven medals, posting personal and seasonal bests in many cases as well as progressing in their individual competitions.",0,1
2024/8/13,"Deportation orders rise sharply to more than 1,000 in past six months State moving towards chartering of planes for those refused asylum as policies on immigration tighten  Nearly 1,100 deportation orders have been issued to asylum seekers over the past six months, with plans for charter planes to enforce removals now at “an advanced stage”. The number of deportation orders is increasing  amid a continuing effort by the Government to toughen up immigration policies. Taoiseach Simon Harris has stated on a number of occasions this year that there is a need to focus on faster processing times and “effective deportations” for asylum seekers who do not have a right to reside in the State. If the current trend continues, the State is on track for a record level of deportation orders in 2024 – potentially well in excess of 2,000 – which would be the highest number in the last four years. Enforced deportations are now up 128 per cent and voluntary returns are up 157 per cent to mid-July, when compared with the same period last year. The Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) is responsible for carrying out inquiries to confirm that people have removed themselves from the State. The bureau works with the Department of Justice to enforce deportations where this is not the case. In 2023 the GNIB removed 52 individuals subject to deportation orders from the State, which was a 100 per cent increase compared with 2022. The Department of Justice said the level of enforcement continued to increase this year, with the GNIB personally removing 65 individuals subject to deportation orders as of July 17th. The department said 1,067 deportation orders were issued up to mid-July. In 2023 in total, there were 948 deportations issued, while the figure for 2022 was 270. This year, to mid-July, there were 303 voluntary returns among asylum seekers, bringing the total of returns this year to 397. The Department of Justice said that in addition to the enforced deportations and those who were otherwise confirmed to have left, there was a “much larger number of people” who had complied with the order to leave and had left the State without informing the department. “However, as there are no routine exit checks at Irish borders to verify if every person has left the State, it is not possible to accurately quantify this number.” The Government is also progressing plans for charter flights to assist with deportations which will start later this year with the procurement process for this “well advanced”. This would be expected to lead to a significant increase in the number of deportations as the bureau currently uses commercial flights for such operations.",0,1
2024/8/13,"Tommy Robinson’s Irish passport may be invalid, TDs say  Far-right figure stated place of birth as ‘Ireland’ when detained by Canadian immigration authorities in June Dáil members have called on the Government to investigate how an Irish passport was obtained by Tommy Robinson, who has been accused of inciting riots from abroad. The Luton-born far-right leader travels on an Irish passport under his real name – Stephen Yaxley-Lennon – and was believed to have qualified for it via his mother, an Irish immigrant to Britain. However, questions have been raised about the validity of the passport after an official form issued to Robinson when he was detained by Canadian immigration authorities in June stated that his place of birth was “Ireland”. Fine Gael TD Charlie Flanagan, chair of the foreign affairs and defence committee, said: “Any questions over the integrity of the Irish passport system must be taken most seriously. “Eligibility for Irish citizenship and grounds for holding an Irish passport are clearly defined in law. Any alleged violation must not only be taken seriously but acted upon and subject to formal investigation by the appropriate authorities.” Two other TDs also expressed concern. Labour deputy Duncan Smith said: “If there are any question marks over the integrity of someone’s passport then that must be investigated. Accurate country of birth information is integral to any passport application.” He called on the UK Foreign Office and the Department of Foreign Affairs to liaise in relation to the accuracy of information given. “We must take on all far-right activism when we see it. If someone is travelling on an Irish passport and fomenting far-right hate then we have a responsibility to explore all methods of pressure to stop it,” Mr Smith added. “It is concerning that someone who is inciting racist violence across Britain and Ireland appears to be travelling on an Irish passport,” said People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy. “It is doubly concerning that the Canadian documentation suggests that his place of birth was given as Ireland. Is that what it says on his passport? If so, his passport would have been issued on a fraudulent basis and could be revoked.” It is unclear why Robinson has chosen to travel on the Irish passport. One reason may be to avoid post-Brexit queues at airports, an irony given he was a committed supporter of the UK leaving the European Union. However, he also has a number of criminal convictions, ranging from assaulting an off-duty police officer to stalking, fraud and drug possession. In 2013, he was jailed for 10 months for using someone else’s passport to travel to the US. He was arrested in June in Canada on suspicion of committing an immigration offence. The image of the immigration authority form was tweeted by Robinson after he was detained, having been ordered to stay in the country and hand over his passport. Robinson has been cultivating links with the emerging Irish far-right and visited the country in February of last year, telling followers on social media that he had come to “report” on anti-immigrant sentiment. While his presence was welcomed by some among the Irish far-right, others were more hostile towards cooperation with British equivalents such as Robinson, who was a member of the British National party in the 2000s. - Guardian",0,1
2024/8/14,"State approved €550,000 salary for MetroLink chief after warning of potential risk to project Department of Public Expenditure noted efforts to recruit project director at lower salary failed to yield candidate of sufficient calibre to manage ‘largest-ever public investment project in the history of the State’ The Government approved a €550,000 salary for the project director of the proposed Dublin MetroLink system following warnings that the failure to secure a suitably qualified person for the role would “represent a significant and unacceptable increase in the overall risk profile” of the project. The Department of Transport advised the Department of Public Expenditure that it would also “potentially expose the taxpayer to foreseeable and avoidable costs in the future”. At the end of June, the Department of Transport announced the appointment of Sean Sweeney, from New Zealand, as the project director for MetroLink following a global recruitment campaign. It said he would receive an annual salary of €550,000, provision of private health insurance cover as well as a leased electric vehicle company car. He would also receive moving and relocation expenses of up to €30,000. The move means that Mr Sweeney will be one of the highest-paid individuals working in the Irish public service. In a note to the Department of Public Expenditure in March seeking approval for the terms for the role, the Department of Transport described MetroLink as a transformative piece of public infrastructure that would likely be “the largest-ever public investment project in the history of the State”. The 18km MetroLink system is designed as a fully segregated, driverless and mostly underground high-capacity new rail link running between Swords and Dublin city centre. The Department of Transport said that top of the list on the risk register for Metrolink, as provided by the National Transport Authority, was that the State agency Transport Infrastructure Ireland would have insufficient resources “to support the procurement and overall delivery programme”. “The most critical role within these required resources is that of project director.” It said it was imperative that clarity be provided to allow a formal offer to be made to the preferred candidate for the post. “The importance of ensuring big projects are led by individuals with the required experience and capabilities is well understood, both domestically and internationally, and was underlined by the observations of the then department of public expenditure and reform’s Major Projects Advisory Group in its review of MetroLink’s preliminary business case when it noted ‘it will be critical to secure a project director with international experience of managing and leading other large metro or tunnelling projects’.” The Department of Transport argued that the open recruitment process carried out by Transport Infrastructure Ireland had shown that a lower salary rate for the post was insufficient to attract the calibre of person recommended by the Major Projects Advisory Group. On the appointment of Mr Sweeney in June, the Department of Transport said Transport Infrastructure Ireland had engaged UK-based specialist recruitment agency Newsom Consulting to assist it in conducting the recruitment process. “Following a comprehensive benchmarking exercise of remuneration in the transportation sector, it found that the mean average total remuneration, excluding any additional benefits, was €623,516.” The Department of Transport told the Department of Public Expenditure that it acknowledged that the proposed terms and conditions for the project director role were significant in a wider public pay environment. It maintained, however, that the amount involved was “appropriate to the international market within which Ireland was competing for this relatively limited pool of expertise”. The Department of Public Expenditure said that, given the need to recruit a person with relevant experience and expertise and that substantial efforts to recruit at a lower salary did not yield an appropriate candidate, its Minister, Paschal Donohoe, agreed to a salary of €550,000 for a fixed-purpose contract.",0,1
2024/8/14,"Ireland has vowed to get tough on social media platforms - what are the options? Taoiseach to convene meeting of State agencies and other stakeholders as concerns about online threats and inflammatory content escalate In the wake of online threats against Irish politicians, and riots in Northern Ireland and the UK fanned by social media, Ireland is vowing to get tough on digital platforms. Taoiseach Simon Harris – who, along with other political leaders, has been on the receiving end of alleged death threats on social media – said last week that the era of self-regulation for tech giants is “well and truly over”. Next month, Harris will convene a meeting of State agencies and other stakeholders. It might be easy to agree that online discourse is causing a problem, but it is sprawling, encompassing a dense thicket of overlapping issues. Knowing exactly what to do about it is not so straightforward. “The whole social media accountability area has lots of problems interacting with each other,” says Liz Carolan, a writer and campaigner on democracy and technology issues. What can be done about online threats? A threat of violence is not made more or less illegal by being made online as opposed to in person. “A bomb threat is an illegal statement, you don’t need new legislation for investigating that,” says Simon McGarr, a solicitor and data-protection expert. When it comes to the platform where a threat is posted – as opposed to the person making the threat – things get more complex. The main instrument here is the Digital Services Act (DSA), a piece of European Union legislation. However, the laws in place don’t simply allow the State – in Ireland, through Coimisiún na Meán – to compel the immediate removal of illegal content from an online platform. An alleged threat against Harris has received extra attention because it stayed up for several days on Instagram, despite the company being alerted to its presence. According to Eileen Culloty, assistant professor in the School of Communications in Dublin City University, the DSA mandates that platforms “must have structures in place to respond when they’re made aware they’re hosting illegal content”. So the onus is on the company, she says – but in reality, that also creates a burden on those reporting. “What this whole model does is put massive, massive strain on civil society and public bodies that have to deal with this,” she says. What happens then? Ultimately, the DSA allows for significant fines of up to 6 per cent of global turnover, as well as daily penalties, while the European Commission has also said it and local authorities will have power to require “immediate actions where necessary to address very serious harms”. When it comes to enforcement, there is a division of labour between local regulators such as Coimisiún na Meán and the European Commission, with Brussels taking on a greater role for larger platforms such as the main social media companies and search engines. Much will depend on how this works in practice, especially how the interaction between regulators and regulated plays out. What about broader issues? A potentially trickier challenge is the spread of content which Culloty dubs “lawful but awful”, for example, pro-anorexia statements or online bullying. For that, the model is for safety codes to be developed, with Coimisiún na Meán promising “strong sanctioning powers and fines of up to €20 million” in its draft online safety code. When it comes to political content that is not illegal but may be misleading, regulation has to sit in a delicate balance with freedom of expression. In an age of misinformation and disinformation, the DSA mandates platforms to make public reports of assessments of risks to civic discourse. However, Culloty says these have so far been “mostly nonsense”. The European Commission has opened formal proceedings against companies, including on political content. What about elections? In Ireland, misinformation and disinformation during elections is the responsibility of the Electoral Commission rather than Coimisiún na Meán – but the parts of legislation governing this have not yet been enacted, with a new draft having been sent to the European Commission in July. The new draft, McGarr says, is better. “It’s more realistic, more defensible and less open to challenge in respect of breaching EU law – and it looks to create an actual operational system.” He warns that much will rely on codes of conduct that have not yet been finalised: “They’ve punted all the really hard parts of this process down to codes of conduct that are not visible to us. It’s a framework, the actual rules are still unknown.” How about radicalisation? Critics of the current approach say it’s overly focused on moderating content rather than more meaningful reforms to how social media works. “It’s not about unpublishing or taking down – it’s a data problem,” says Johnny Ryan of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. Online platforms push inflammatory content into people’s feeds, he says, amplifying and rapidly distributing it. A more straightforward approach, he argues, is to rely on existing laws around processing personal data under the GDPR to prevent companies from using information about people’s preferences to serve them this content. What is at stake for Ireland here? In reality, much of the new framework for oversight and regulation is in its infancy. How they work in the real world will depend on how specific cases are handled. The new powers, Carolan says, could be a “sledgehammer”, and she welcomes overt signals from Harris that regulators will be supported in using their new powers. But the true test of the new system – and of the strength of the politicians’ commitment to enforcing it – is likely to emerge only over time. For Ireland, she argues there is a clear benefit in being to the fore of regulation rather than risk reputational damage. “Being seen as the Cayman Islands from a regulatory point of view is going to start to hurt,” she says.",0,1
2024/8/15,"Future use of GPO building could play key role in rejuvenation of Dublin city, Donohoe suggests Minister says he is ‘open to really imaginative ideas’ for new use of historic postal building on O’Connell Street A reimagining of the historic GPO building on O’Connell Street could play a key role in improving and rejuvenating Dublin city centre, the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has suggested. The Minister, who is a TD for the area, said he wanted to see the role and future of the GPO addressed in the time ahead. The GPO, apart from being the most famous location associated with the Easter Rising in 1916, is also the former headquarters of An Post and is one of the main post offices in Dublin. “One of the issues I certainly want to address in the time ahead is the role and the future of the GPO building, and what that means for O’Connell Street and for the city centre, because I think that can be part of how we respond, back to how we can make O’Connell Street, in particular, a better place to come to and spend time.” The Minister said he was “open to really imaginative ideas” for what the GPO could become in the future. Mr Donohoe was speaking at The Depot at The Complex near Smithfield in Dublin. He said this building had been transformed from a warehouse for storing fruit into an arts venue. “Part of the building is where freezer units used to be that would hold fruit that was at risk of decomposing.” “That is now a performance space. And if you can do that with a building like this, it is a reminder of what we should be able to do with the rest of our city.” Mr Donohoe said he expected that the report of the taskforce established by the Government on improving the city centre’s public realm, safety and experience within the next few weeks. He said he had met the chair of the group David McRedmond recently. “I am very much aware of the challenges that we clearly do still have within our city centre. I do believe there are things that are improving in Dublin; things that are getting better in Dublin. Look at where we are here. Look at this amazing facility (at the Depot at the Complex) that is located in the heart of Dublin. But lots of people probably aren’t aware of it, which is why it’s great to be here. “But something like this is only part of the response back to how we can make this not only a great city to live in, but a great city to visit and go out in. And we’re not where we want to be with regard to that, but I think we will get there. And the report from David McRedmond will be important.”",0,1
2024/8/15,"FG to commit to establishing new Department of Infrastructure in election manifesto, Donohoe says Minister says proposal put forward by Taoiseach is ‘the kind of change that can make a big difference’ Fine Gael will give a commitment to establishing a new Government Department of Infrastructure in its manifesto for the next election, the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has said. He said such a proposal – which was put forward some weeks ago by Taoiseach Simon Harris – represented “the kind of change that can make a big difference”. Mr Donohoe said Mr Harris had identified “a really big challenge that we are going to face in a few year’s time”. “That challenge is that we are going to have a large number of really big infrastructure projects all coming through the planning process, all inside the same term of the Government.” “And the Government will want to try to make all of them happen or most of them happen.” Mr Donohoe said the point the Taoiseach had made about changing Government structures to make that happen was “a really good proposal”. “I will certainly be working with him in the next few months to further flesh that out [the establishment of a new Department for Infrastructure] and explain how it would work.” Mr Donohoe said the challenge with the proposal would be defining what represented really important infrastructure and what did not. The Minister pointed to the proposed Dublin Metrolink system which he described as a “huge project”. He said the system – which is scheduled to run from Swords in north county Dublin to Charlemont on the south side of the city and could cost between €9 billion and €12 billion – was one which the Department of Transport was aiming to deliver. “But if you were to move a project like that now away from the Department of Transport, or away from the National Transport Authority, it could make it even far harder to do.” However, Mr Donohoe said he supported the plan to establish a separate Department of Infrastructure “and we’ll look at how that would work now in the coming weeks and months”. Speaking at the annual MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Co Donegal last month, Mr Harris said his aim was to centralise the management of infrastructure projects into one dedicated department. “I want our State to improve on its delivery of small, medium, and large-scale projects. You know all about the large capital projects that go over budget and over time. You probably don’t hear about all the projects that get done on time and under budget, and we have lots of those,” Mr Harris said.",0,1
2024/8/15,"Migrants group criticises ‘pure ignorance’ of much social media commentary on asylum seekers  People Before Profit publish Bill which would allow asylum seekers the right to work while their applications are processed There would not be a “pull” factor if asylum seekers were given an automatic entitlement to work in the State, People Before Profit (PBP) has claimed. The party has published a Bill which would allow asylum seekers to have a right to work while their asylum applications are being processed. Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI) spokesman Bulelani Mfaco said asylum seekers are not motivated by a right to work when choosing where to apply for international protection. Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Mr Mfaco, a South African man who was granted asylum last year having been in Ireland since 2015, said countries such as Sweden and Portugal have less restrictive employment rights than Ireland but are not getting relatively more migrants. There was “constant pushback”, he suggested, to giving asylum seekers an automatic entitlement to work as many believe it would lead to more people seeking international protection in the State. He responded: “I don’t believe that there is anybody in Nigeria, Sudan, Jordan or Palestine that is going through different asylum systems at present who is selecting what country will give them the best reception. I don’t believe that is the case.” He suggested there was “pure ignorance” out there as to how the asylum process worked and not many people knew that asylum seekers are not allowed to work when they first arrive in Ireland. “Things like that fuel the kind of ignorance we see online and [that] is now spilling over into the streets. We need to have responsible leadership when it comes to how we talk about migration.” Currently asylum seekers can apply for the right to work only after being in Ireland for five months and there is a 150-day wait. PBP TD Paul Murphy said the Government was currently engaged in “performative cruelty” with asylum seekers and was pandering to far-right protesters. The cruelty is intended to distract from Government failures in terms of housing, healthcare and cost of living and instead to focus attention on migrants, he claimed. He said the fact that there are 2,000 asylum seekers in the State who are currently on the streets is an “absolute scandal”. “There are enough empty beds in the system for every one of the currently homeless asylum seekers.” He was also critical of Sinn Féin’s policy on asylum, stating that in three of its recently announced five-point plan it planned to be harder on asylum seekers than the current Government. Mr Murphy suggested it would make “all the sense in the world” for asylum seekers to be allowed to work and contribute where there are labour shortages such as in the construction industry and in public transport where bus drivers are needed. Up to 10,000 asylum seekers could benefit from an automatic right to work based on current figures, he suggested. “That would result in a real integration in workplaces. It would break down some of the suspicion and fear that exists because people would be working side-by-side with asylum seekers and seeing that these are people like you and me who want to work and contribute to society.” The latest figures for international protection applicants show 429 arriving the week ending July 7th, 328 the week ending July 14th, 285 the week ending July 21st, 424 for the week ending August 4th and 388 for the week ending August 11th. No figures from the Department of Justice are available for the week ending July 28th.",0,1
2024/8/16,"Minister of State has faced ‘endless’ lobbying over upcoming gambling legislation Long-awaited Bill should become law by mid-October, says Fianna Fáil politician James Browne Far-reaching legislation to strictly regulate gambling in Ireland for the first time will become law before this Government’s term has come to an end, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice has said. James Browne, who has responsibility for gambling, confirmed the Gambling Regulation Bill will complete its passage through the Oireachtas by mid-October. The Wexford TD has been working on the Bill since being appointed four years ago and has refused to water down any of its provisions on advertising, stake limits for slot machines or criminalising failure to protect children from gambling. This, he said, is despite what he described as “endless” lobbying from the racing, betting and gambling industries. The Bill will establish a regulator to oversee gambling and gaming activity, will prohibit related advertising from 5.30am to 9pm and will impose prison sentences of up to eight years on those who fail to protect children from gambling. Inducements such as “free bets”, VIP treatment, free credit and free hospitality are all banned under the Bill. Adults will have to actively opt in to receive betting advertisements online and there will be a ban on social media advertising. In all, there have been 61 separate listings of lobbying activity to politicians, officials and Ministers during the course of this year. About half of those were made by charities and sports clubs concerned that the provisions would not allow them to run draws and lotteries. Mr Browne said the Bill would be going through the final stages in the Seanad and Dáil soon after the Oireachtas returns from its summer recess in late September. He said he held a meeting with the Attorney General earlier this month and will hold another one at the end of the month to progress the legislation. “We are now on track to go back into Seanad Éireann on around September 26th. The following week it will complete report and final stage in the Seanad and go back to the Dáil around October 8th,” he added. At that stage, the final vote on the legislation will be completed. Mr Browne has allowed some amendments, including for draws and lotteries run by charities and sports organisations. He said the amendments had to be carefully drafted to prevent any entity that was not a charity passing itself off as one for the purposes of making profit from a draw. He also allowed amendments in relation to bingo, after representations were made by that industry, specifically around bingo books. The Fianna Fáil politician said most of the drafting work being done on the legislation at present related to technical measures associated with consolidating different pieces of legislation, some of which were more than 100 years old. Mr Browne said he had refused to change or increase the stake limit for casino games and slot machines despite intense lobbying over the matter. He said there was a distinction between those games, which were pure games of chance, and horse racing, where there is an element of skill in terms of choosing a stake. “For example, with poker casino games there will be bet limits and that’s partly to do with the fact there is no skill in it. There is also the fact that people can bet so much so quickly by continuing to hit the button on that machine,” he said. Prominent bookmaking companies – including Flutter and Boylesports – separately wrote to dozens of TDs and held meetings with senior politicians and officials to lobby for changes in the legislation. Many of the commercial companies expressed concern about the consequences of the strict advertising restrictions on the betting and horse-racing industries. Bauer Media, which owns Newstalk and Today FM, and Virgin Media Ireland lobbied on this issue. In its return to the lobbying register, Virgin Media Ireland said it had met Mr Browne to point out the “potential consequences of the Bill for Virgin Media TV as a public service broadcaster”. News Brands Ireland, representing newspapers and media organisations, met Department of Justice officials and stated it had sought “clarification on certain provisions affecting news publishers”.",0,1
2024/8/18,"New water charges for business and farmers will be excessive, claims former minister Sean Canney has called on the Government to intervene but Uisce Éireann has said that annual increase will be less than €250 for vast majority of users Proposed increases in water charges for non-domestic users from October will excessively penalise small businesses and farmers, an Independent Dáil deputy has claimed. Seán Canney, a TD for Galway East and former minister of State for the Office of Public Works, has called on the Government to intervene with Uisce Éireann and instruct it not to impose the new charging regime. The new tariffs for water and wastewater will be introduced on October 1st. The standing charge per connection will double from €43 to €83 and there will be a 15 per cent increase in water charges for Band 1 users (who use a volume of less than 1,000 square meters), with other ranges of increases for larger users. Mr Canney said that increases in electricity and other costs had already made trading difficult for small business and farmers. “Uisce Éireann is now intending to increase the cost of water to these businesses at the wrong time. “The doubling of the standing charges for water connections will place an excessive cost on farmers, especially suckler and dry stock farmers. “Farmers’ income has fallen, as confirmed in the latest Teagasc survey, and small businesses are struggling to keep their doors open,” he said. The changes were approved by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) earlier this year. Irish Water said there had been no update to tariffs for business customers since they were last set in 2019. It also pointed to a CRU information note that said the majority of customers will see bill increases of less than €250 annually. It also said that customers facing larger increases could also benefit from a bill-capping arrangement, if the cost of the increased tariff is €750 more. It said that 86 per cent of customers (162,905 connections) would see annual bill increases of less than €250; that 5.4 per cent would see annual bill increases of between €250 and €500; that 7.4 per cent would see annual bill increases of between €500 and €5,000; and less than 1 per cent would have bill increases of €5,000 or more. However, Mr Canney said the increases would have a serious impact on some users and could be the “last straw”. “We may see further closure of small family businesses and the strong movement away from farming. The Government need to intervene as a matter of urgency,” he said. “This is not good news for rural Ireland and the rural economy will bear the brunt of these unnecessary and ill-timed increases”.",0,1
2024/8/18,"Ireland not immune from terror threat, warns Taoiseach Garda Commissioner has reportedly increased threat level posed by political extremists from moderate to substantial Ireland is not immune to the threat of terrorism, the Taoiseach has said. Simon Harris said Ireland should “always be conscious” of the risks of terrorism and extremism as he said gardaí are monitoring such matters very closely. His comments come amid a spate of threats against elected representatives from extreme groups. It also follows a report that the Garda Commissioner has increased the threat level posed by violent political extremists from moderate to substantial. Mr Harris, who has been subjected to threats against him personally as well as the family home he shares with his wife and children, said the spectre of terrorism is taken seriously by State security services. “Ireland is not immune from the threats we see in other countries, we should never think that we are,” he said. “We’re not immune from the threat of terrorism – domestic or international. But I am confident that the gardaí take these matters very seriously.” Speaking to reporters at the Tullow Agricultural Show in Co Carlow on Sunday, he refused to confirm the change in security policy. The report in The Sunday Times states the increased threat level means an attack is considered likely. “For obvious reasons, I don’t comment on confidential security briefings other than to reiterate that our country is not in any manner or means immune from the threat of terrorism, be that domestic or international. We should always be conscious of that. We have seen many examples in many countries, and indeed examples in Ireland, of extremism. We know the risks that poses. Whilst I don’t comment on specifics, the gardaí would always monitor these matters closely and they will take whatever measures they believe to be appropriate.” Asked if he is willing to introduce tougher legislation on threats against public figures, Mr Harris said: “I am confident that when we look at the laws of the land, that our laws are robust.” The Taoiseach said gardaí will be supported with any resources they need to enforce those laws, and he added he is “very satisfied” with the work they do to keep people safe. Asked about his concerns about the campaigning environment for politicians in the run-up to the next election, Mr Harris said: “We need to have a balanced conversation about this – our country hasn’t dramatically changed. “This is a country full of decent people and our politicians of all political persuasions live in their communities and move amongst people and are accessible to the public. “I don’t think we should allow a small-in-number group of people distort who we are as a people. I haven’t detected any significant shift from the people of Ireland right across the country. But of course, it is important to acknowledge we are a country that faces threats.” Mr Harris said gardaí will make sure candidates can campaign in a safe environment, whenever the election is held. Mr Harris was also asked about comments made by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly who, in an interview with the Business Post, said there is not a culture of productivity in hospitals. “I think any conversation about health needs to be a balanced conversation between the issue of investment and reform. “What Stephen Donnelly has rightly done is try to really analyse the extra investment that is being made in the health service, what difference are we seeing in terms on benefits. Any fair assessment of the health service will point to much significant progress made by people working in the health service on behalf of patients. But it is right to say when you look at some hospitals that you can’t just reduce the conversation to investment. He is right to look at how our hospitals are run and managed.” – Additional reporting PA",0,1
2024/8/19,"Doug Beattie steps down as UUP leader due to ‘irreconcilable differences’ with party officers The Upper Bann Assembly member said leading the Ulster Unionist Party had been a ‘lonely’ experience at times The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), once dominant in Northern Irish politics, is now seeking its eighth leader in less than 20 years, following the resignation of Doug Beattie after just three years in the post. In a sharp, even bitter resignation letter, Beattie said he was quitting in the face of “irreconcilable differences” between him and senior party officers over the direction of the party. His decision, a surprise in its timing, but that only, leaves the party now trying to find a new leader ahead of its party conference next month, and with a major, if not impossible task to restore the party’s fortunes. Considerably more liberal in his views than the party’s officers, Mr Beattie took the post in 2021 having refused it previously, and only after he had clearly indicated the direction he wanted to take the party to challenge the Democratic Unionist Party. However, it has been an unhappy political marriage almost from the off, with Mr Beattie saying that his differences with party officers “combined with the inability to influence and shape the party going forward” meant that he could no longer stay on. In the Westminster elections, the UUP’s Robert Swann, who was then Stormont’s Health Minister, comfortably won a House of Commons seat in South Antrim, which the party had lost in 2017. In all, the UUP won nearly 95,000 votes across Northern Ireland – one in eight of those cast, a half-point percentage rise on its last outing in 2019, which Mr Beattie described as “small successes” on the back of previous difficult results. The last straw for the former British Army soldier and holder of the Military Cross came after his bid to have Robert Swann replaced in the Stormont Assembly as the MLA for North Antrim by Ballymoney councillor Darryl Wilson was rejected. Though still young, Wilson is a liberal unionist but already an experienced councillor. However, the party executive chose Colin Crawford, who is a less experienced councillor, but more traditional in his views. Beattie had taken a major gamble in letting Robert Swann run in the Westminster elections and in replacing him as Health Minister ahead of that vote – a move that met considerable resistance and worry within the organisation. Equally, Mr Beattie had favoured taking the UUP into opposition in Stormont, rather than taking up its one available place on the Northern Executive, but, again, he was over-ruled by party officers. He believed the UUP could better define itself against the DUP outside of the Executive. However, the conservative rearguard quickly reformed when it came to Swann’s replacement in Stormont deciding in favour of Crawford, despite Beattie’s “apoplectic” rage.  Robin Butler MLA is deemed the likely favourite to replace him, possibly even the only candidate. Beattie is understood to have tendered his resignation six weeks ago in the wake of losing on the Crawford/Wilson choice, though he is then understood to have sought to withdraw it, though the party officers refused to allow him to do so. Now, it appears that Mr Beattie enjoyed the support of just two of the ten party officers and it is believed that the majority were ready to seek his ousting in coming weeks – a move which led Beattie to activate his resignation decision on Monday morning, to the surprise of many in the organisation. Paying tribute to Mr Beattie, the SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said they have “different politics but I’ve always admired his candour and commitment to working together in the interests of the people we represent”. President Michael D. Higgins offered his best wishes to Mr Beattie, saying that he had appreciated his “open and courageous” attitude to the challenges facing reconciliation in Northern Ireland. First Minister, Sinn Féin’s Michelle O’Neill wished him well, saying she had “worked constructively” with him, adding that she would do the same with the new leader of the party when that person is elected. Former minister for foreign affairs, Fine Gael’s Simon Coveney said he was sorry to see Beattie “stepping back” from leadership, saying he had found the former soldier to “be fair, tough when needed, reasonable and positive”.",0,1
2024/8/20,"Farmers should not be ‘penalised’ by residential zoned land tax, Taoiseach says Simon Harris confirms that tax, which was due to kick in next year, has been deferred Taoiseach Simon Harris has defended plans to defer the residential zoned land tax stating that active farmers should not be penalised or “wrongly taxed”. The tax was due to kick in next year, with landowners facing an annual three per cent payment on the market value of land that is earmarked for housing and also serviced by infrastructure that would allow residential development. However these plans now be deferred, the Taoiseach confirmed. “As long as I am Taoiseach, no active farmer is going to pay (residential zoned land tax), simple as. I’ve said it many times, I said it when I became leader, I said it to the Irish Farmers’ Association, it was never meant to be about penalising a farmer, an active farmer. “And I think the IFA’s position on this has been very reasonable, because they too differentiate between an active farmer and somebody who is maybe not being an active farmer and is trying to avoid paying tax. So, the Government will make a decision as a collective in relation to this around the budget time. “But the Department of Finance in my view needs to fix this legislation, it needs to come forward with proposals as to how this legislation can be applied. I don’t want to see people hoarding land, but I also do not want to see, and will not stand over, a situation where an active farmer wrongly gets taxed. So that’s what the Department of Finance needs to work on. Whether they decide to defer it for another year, or whether they decide to come forward with amending legislation, I’m open to engagement,” Mr Harris said. Asked if he accepts that a deferral of the tax essentially meant a continuation of land hoarding, he said: “I don’t. I am absolutely committed to that legislation, but we need the Department of Finance to listen and respond to legitimate concerns and I think they should take the time between now and the budget to come forward with proposals on that.” Separately, Mr Harris again promised a cost-of-living package in the forthcoming budget, and also indicated that Ministers are considering extending the free hot school meals programme into the summer months for children. “The next step is around how you address holiday hunger. I would like to look at that in the context of the budget as to how we continue to provide meals to children, particularly children of a disadvantaged background ... I know this is something that is being looked at.” The Taoiseach was also asked about the ongoing conflict in Gaza, after US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu accepted a “bridging proposal” presented by Washington to tackle disagreements blocking a ceasefire deal. Mr Harris said that the EU could do more and use further levers to increase pressure for a ceasefire. “The Irish Government’s position is that there needs to be an immediate ceasefire. The amount of aid going into Gaza has rapidly decreased in the summer months.  “After the ICJ ruling and all the condemnation of the world, there is less aid going into Gaza now as there was just under a month ago. I call on every party involved in talks to really dig deep. Can the Irish Government do more? I ask myself that every single day and I mean that very sincerely. I find what is happening in the Middle East to be grotesque and almost unimaginable in terms of the scale of the catastrophe and violence.” “I do not believe the world, including the European Union, has done enough to bring about a ceasefire. I think when we look back at this time it will be a time of dark shame.” He said he wants to a review of the EU Israel Association Agreement.

2024/8/21,"Efforts to defuse Coalition row over planned deferral of residential zoned land tax Tax was due to kick in next year, with landowners facing an annual 3% payment on the value of land earmarked for housing  Efforts are under way within the Coalition to defuse a row between the Green Party and Fianna Fáil over the planned deferral of the residential zoned land tax. Taoiseach Simon Harris said this week that the tax could be delayed in order to prevent “active farmers being penalised.” It came after reports that Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance Jack Chambers was planning the deferral. The tax was due to kick in next year, with landowners facing an annual 3 per cent payment on the market value of land that is earmarked for housing and also serviced by infrastructure that would allow residential development. The Irish Times yesterday reported tensions within the Green Party over the move with party TD Steven Matthews describing the plans to defer the tax as “incredible” and “like hiding food in a famine”. On Wednesday, Minister of State in the Department of Environment and Communications Ossian Smyth said a deferral would not be accepted. “Deferring the entire tax for a year because you found some hard cases that are the minority of people is not the right answer. So ... if there are a proposals to identify somebody who is a hard case, who’s being treated unfairly and that they need to have some kind of a pay-off or an exemption, that’s fine. “But what we’re not going to do is defer tax for a year. I would never accept that – that’s not going to happen.” Following his comments, a senior Government source told The Irish Times that the deferral may still proceed notwithstanding Green Party misgivings. The source said the current advice is that the only way to exclude active farmers from having to pay the tax is through a deferral while alternative solutions are identified. However, the source emphasised that all options were being explored in order to find a solution. Senior Fine Gael sources were privately critical of Mr Chambers and said that no such decision to defer had been made when reports first emerged. It is understood that the Taoiseach discussed the issue briefly with Tánaiste Micheál Martin on Wednesday, as open divisions between the Green Party and Fianna Fáil became clear. Senior Government sources agreed it would be difficult for the Green Party to back down given the public position taken, but suggested that compromise could be amending the legislation, perhaps through the Finance Bill, to exclude land that is being actively farmed. Other sources, however, pointed to difficulties with this approach. The row shines a light on the growing sense of tension within Government as the Coalition approaches its last budget during its final few months in office. Within the Green Party there is an awareness that the party could be facing a difficult general election. All parties will be keen to appeal to their own voters and potential voters – and less careful about offending their Coalition partners.",0,1
2024/8/21,"‘Like hiding food in a famine’: Coalition at war over plans to defer land tax Annual 3 per cent payment on market value of land was due to begin next year The Green Party is at loggerheads with its Coalition partners over plans to defer the residential zoned land tax  to prevent farmers being penalised. The tax was due to kick in next year, with landowners facing an annual 3 per cent payment on the market value of land that is earmarked for housing and also serviced by infrastructure that would allow residential development. Taoiseach Simon Harris confirmed on Tuesday that these plans may now be deferred  to avoid active farmers being “wrongly taxed.” Chair of the Oireachtas Housing Committee and Green Party TD Steven Matthews described the plans to defer the tax as “incredible” and “like hiding food in a famine”. “It is incredible that Fianna Fáil, for the second year in a row, are looking not to implement this tax. They have had plenty of time to iron out any difficulties. Do they not realise that there is a housing emergency? That there are people crying out for homes and that we have to increase our housing output of affordable, social, private and cost rental homes. It is incumbent on the Minister for Housing and Minister for Finance to use every possible option to alleviate the housing crisis affecting our people. “The zoned land tax is not a silver bullet, but abandoning it is cash in hand for landowning speculators. Hoarding land and depriving society of the urgent and basic need of an adequate number of houses is like hiding food in a famine. It is unacceptable and Fianna Fáil need to rethink this failure to act.” A Green Party source said the Government agreed to the measure to ensure that speculators don’t sit on land that has been earmarked for new homes  to watch its value go up. “It’s already been delayed by a year and now Fianna Fáil want to long-finger it beyond the election, which means it may never happen. Everyone in Government agrees that we need in the region of 50,000 new homes every year but that’s going to be impossible if we allow speculators to sit on parcels of land that have been specifically zoned and serviced with infrastructure such as roads, electricity wires and water supplies. “There is already a facility whereby farmers who genuinely don’t want to sell or build on their land can avoid the tax and forego the increase in the value of their land that typically comes with zoning by asking for their land to be dezoned.” Earlier on Tuesday Mr Harris said: “I do not want to see, and will not stand over, a situation where an active farmer wrongly gets taxed.”",0,1
2024/8/22,"Deferral of land tax not a ‘cynical ploy’ before election, Fianna Fáil Minister of State says Thomas Byrne’s comments come amid rising tensions with Green Party over proposed move A plan to defer the proposed Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT) by a further year is “not a cynical ploy before the next election”, Minister of State for Sport Thomas Byrne has said. The Fianna Fáil TD said he believed “every party” agreed that farmers should not have to pay the tax. The Irish Times previously reported tensions in the Green Party over the move, with Steven Matthews TD describing the plan to defer the tax as “incredible” and “like hiding food in a famine”. Minister of State Ossian Smyth on Wednesday said a deferral would not be accepted. Speaking on Thursday, Mr Byrne said he supported Minister for Finance Jack Chambers’ plan to defer the tax, intended to encourage the timely development of serviced land that is zoned residential. “I don’t think anybody disagrees with the concept that a farmer who doesn’t want houses on their land, is not interested in zoning their land should have to pay a tax on that land which they are working on as farm land, or in some cases that I’m familiar with, literally their farm yard. That’s not something that anybody wants,” he told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. “I think the bottom line is that everybody is in agreement with Minister Chambers, that a farmer who was farming land, who was not interested in putting houses on the land or maximising the value of the land, shouldn’t have to pay a tax on it. “There’s political agreement there that no farmer who is farming their land should have to pay this tax. I don’t think anybody would disagree.” Speaking later to reporters, Mr Byrne said the differences of opinion were “nothing compared to what has gone on in the past”. He insisted there have been “remarkably few public disagreements” between the Government parties while the Coalition had “worked remarkably well together by any standards”. The Meath East TD said that when there are issues between the parties, they get resolved by the leaders and “that’s the professional approach we’ve taken”.  Taoiseach Simon Harris has also weighed in support of Mr Chambers, saying active farmers should not be penalised or “wrongly taxed”.",0,1
2024/8/22,"Residential zoned land tax: Why has the issue ballooned into a major political row? Greens are angry over plans to defer residential zoned land tax, moving from find-a-fudge mode to start-a-fight mode The row between Fianna Fáil and the Green Party over plans to defer the residential zoned land tax (RZLT) has all the hallmarks of a silly-season spat which seems worse in public than it is in private. Upon closer inspection, however, there is an ominous undercurrent developing between the two bigger parties and their smaller Coalition partner. In recent days, the Greens haven’t just raised concerns about the plans to defer the tax – they have emphatically said they will not accept it. This is a budget battle, yes, but the Green Party is also laying down a more significant marker in advance of the general election. The party is moving from find-a-fudge mode to start-a-fight mode. Entering the boxing ring this week was Minister of State Ossian Smyth, who told RTÉ's Claire Byrne that he was “amazed” to read about the plans to defer the tax. On air, he sounded simultaneously angry and perplexed. “What we are not going to do is defer the tax for a year. I would never accept that. That is not going to happen.” He said “most of the land is not farming land ... the majority of this land is not agricultural.” Party TD Steven Matthews went one step further and said it was “like hiding food in a famine”. The Greens have marched to the top of the hill and their message is that they are not for turning. That hardening of language at this current political juncture is no coincidence: there’s an election on the horizon, and strategists within the party fear it will be a difficult one. With a new leader, Roderic O’Gorman, in situ, the Greens are signalling that they will be a feistier force in the looming (and potentially quite short) Dáil term. In the meantime, a political fudge on the land tax issue will have to be found. Right now, the shape of that fix is unknown, but there is a growing consensus across the Coalition that it should not be allowed to become a bigger issue than it needs to be. The tax was originally introduced to penalise people who were hoarding land during a housing crisis. To come within the scope of the RZLT, farmland must be both zoned for residential use and serviced. The aim is to ensure an appropriate supply of housing on zoned lands; all parties agree on this part. The issue which has emerged is that many farmers are saying their land, which they use actively for farming, will unfairly come within the remit of the tax. Some of them say it will put them out of work. Others say they would have to sell their land because they cannot afford the tax, and this could end up being a boon for speculators who could snap up the land and sit on it. Other farmers say the tax would be multiples of what the land could economically return for them in a year. This issue has not come out of the blue, though. As part of Budget 2024, it was decided to extend the liability date of the tax by one year, from February 2024 to February 2025. This was to give those very landowners the opportunity to raise issues for the consideration of the local authority, including around zoning. Landowners were given until the end of May to make dezoning requests. A senior Government source said: “It became clear around this time that many active farmers were still affected, and this is where the problem has arisen.” They said that some farmers who sought the dezoning of their lands have experienced difficulty doing so. It is not clear, however, how many farmers are actually affected by this. What’s the solution? Amended primary legislation to exclude active farming land could be introduced, with a shorter deferral to take the heat out of the issue. But defining what is, or is not, “actively farmed” land could be a thornier task than some imagine.",0,1
2024/8/23,"Leo Varadkar in America: ‘I always thought Kamala Harris has a lot of strength’ Former taoiseach spent week as guest of Nancy Pelosi at Democratic National Convention in Chicago The last time that Leo Varadkar was in the United States as a political representative was in March, as taoiseach. A political lifetime ago. He met vice-president Kamala Harris for a breakfast at her residence in the Naval Observatory on the Friday. That Sunday, he met president Joe Biden for the traditional St Patrick’s Day Oval Office sit-down. Then, two days after returning to Ireland, he announced that had decided to step down from the office of taoiseach. This week, he was back in the United States as a guest of former House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Democratic National Convention. The Californian party grandee invited him during her visit to Ireland in April and as a “political anorak” he wasn’t going to miss it. He spent Wednesday and Thursday as both guest and part of the Pelosi entourage during a relentless round of meetings and engagements. “It was interesting to see her operate and even to observe from a personal point of view, for years it was me,” he told The Irish Times shortly before leaving Chicago on Friday. “There were all handlers and advisers around me in the role of taoiseach. And so I was more aware of what they were doing this week than when I was principal because in that role, everyone is coming up to you for the quick chats or interviews. So it was interesting to be part of the part of that entourage. “I always appreciated what they do, but you see how much plans can chop and change and how extra things need to be accommodated and that is all done for you. And every adviser wants to get their thing on the programme and it isn’t always possible. So, it was interesting to see it all play out.” In the days after he stepped down as taoiseach, among the phone calls Varadkar received was one from president Biden, just for a private conversation. It is unlikely that the president had the faintest inkling that he himself would relinquish his Democratic candidacy less than three months later, setting in motion the chain of events which led to a euphoric Democratic convention over the past week. “I actually haven’t had a chance to speak with him and probably should reach out to him but I haven’t yet – it is easier for him to get me than the other way around, as you can probably imagine! “I think for him it must have been a very personally difficult decision. But there is no doubt it has reinvigorated the campaign and there is a level of energy and enthusiasm that wasn’t there a few weeks ago, particularly with younger voters.” Like many political people, Varadkar has spent the last two decades staying up until the early hours watching convention night coverage. In Chicago this week, he attended an Irish-American Democrats lunch as guest, along with Ireland’s ambassador to the United States, Geraldine Byrne Nason. But convention days start early and end late and he spent most of the time in Nancy Pelosi’s entourage. He had a clear idea of the largesse of the event but witnessing it up close is different. “It is only when you are on floor and see it for yourself that you get the scale of the panorama – it’s more like a rock concert or sporting event rather than a political conference in that regard. One thing that did strike me was the diversity of America – people from all sorts of racial and religious backgrounds, young people, old people.” Watching Harris speak on Thursday night must have taken him back to the overcast March morning when she hosted an Irish delegation. It was his second sit-down meeting the vice-president and, again, she spent two hours engaging in substantial conversation. “I always thought Kamala Harris has a lot of strength,” he says. “Being vice-president is a difficult job. You are always in the shadow of the president. You are the number two person, the backup person. I always felt that she didn’t get a chance to shine – and now maybe she will have that chance.” As for the likelihood of a November election in Ireland, with another Harris on the ballot paper, the former taoiseach professes no special insight. “Ultimately that is going to be a decision for the party leaders. While I am a sitting TD and remain very active, I have no inside knowledge. “It is my view that the best time to hold an election is when you think you can win it. There is no guarantee that will be the case ... it is a decision the party leaders will have to take. “Thankfully it is not my call any more. It is also easier said than done. My plan as taoiseach was not to hold a winter election – I would have preferred to hold an election once Brexit was ratified and unfortunately because of events in British politics it wasn’t ratified until December and that was one of the reasons that had us in a winter election [in February 2020] that I would have preferred to have avoided, but, c’est la vie.”",0,1
2024/8/24,"Harris promises one-off payments will run for third year in giveaway budget Taoiseach says budget will be similar to last year with tax reductions and welfare increases Taoiseach Simon Harris has given the clearest indication yet of plans for a giveaway budget, including a fresh boost to infrastructure spending and a new round of payments for households. Harris said the Government would use the proceeds from the sale of the State’s stake in AIB to speed up vital energy and water projects. He also signalled that in the forthcoming general election he would put forward a major reform of early childhood education provision in which the State would take a more central role. Cost-of-living giveaways in the budget will be paid before Christmas, the Taoiseach also confirmed, saying these “one-off” payments would continue for a third year. In an interview with The Irish Times, Mr Harris confirmed that the budget would be similar to last year, including tax reductions, permanent spending increases (including welfare increases) and a package of cost-of-living payments. In addition, Mr Harris said the budget could also contain a package of top-up funding for infrastructural projects, utilising the proceeds of the State’s AIB shareholding, which he said amounted to about €2 billion. He said the priority areas for infrastructure investment were water, energy and housing. With an election looming and the public finances showing a large surplus*, Ministers expect a giveaway budget on October 1st, though the Government will stress that any spending increases will be affordable and it will continue to save much of the large surplus for future needs. Mr Harris said he believed he had two jobs to do – firstly, to implement the programme for government and lead the Coalition for the rest of its term but then to lead Fine Gael into the election and seek a mandate to lead the government for another five years. On this, he indicated that he was considering proposing that the State’s education system be extended to include early childhood education. Elsewhere Mr Harris said large tent encampments erected by asylum seekers would not be permitted “as long as I’m in this office”, and he was critical of “official Ireland” for turning a “semi-blind eye” to the situation on Mount Street and the Grand Canal where hundreds of tents had been pitched until moved on to other locations by the authorities at his insistence earlier this year. “Yes, tents pop up from time to time,” Mr Harris said. “I’m not dismissive about that, I take that very seriously, but I’ve also been honest about that. I said that when we cleared the encampment at Mount Street. But it’s very different from that happening for a number of days and then people being provided with better, more suitable accommodation, to people living there for months with real, very, very serious public health challenges along with many other challenges as well.” Mr Harris was strongly critical of the European Union on the situation in Gaza, saying it had “not done nearly enough in relation to that”. He said Ireland would continue to press at EU level for the EU-Israel trade agreement to be reviewed, but added that “the very clear legal advice available to me and to my predecessors through successive attorneys general is that issues around trade are European competencies”. But when pressed on whether Ireland could take unilateral action against Israel, he said: “I’m not aware of other avenues directly available to us.” Mr Harris hailed the recent improvement in relations with London, but on Northern Ireland he said he did not intend to make preparations for a border poll or a united Ireland. He said a united Ireland was his and Fine Gael’s aspiration but stressed his priority was to work the Belfast Agreement to improve co-operation between North and South. “I think the most important thing we have to do right now is not just make preparations for anything, but actually get on with utilising the Good Friday Agreement to bring about its full potential,” he said. Mr Harris continued to insist the Government would complete its full term, saying this was the request of the leaders of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party when he became Taoiseach in April. *This article was amended on August 24th, 2024",0,1
2024/8/24,"Simon Harris: ‘I can’t give the whole manifesto away, but should early childhood be part of the education system in a more formal way?’ In his first big interview as Taoiseach, the Fine Gael leader hints at his ‘big ideas’ on childcare, housing and infrastructural projects It can’t have been much of a holiday. A few days in Portugal. A spell in Fota. Pleasant no doubt. But the phone doesn’t stop ringing. Neither does the incessant haring around the country. In recent weeks, Taoiseach Simon Harris has attended agricultural shows in Tinahely, Tullamore, Dungarvan, Tullow and Virginia. He’s been at the Fleadh Cheoil, the Rose of Tralee, the Kilkenny Arts Festival and the MacGill Summer School. There were the Olympics and the All-Ireland finals. No Fine Gael Minister has been safe from a sudden appearance in their constituency. Tomorrow Harris will deliver the annual Michael Collins oration at Béal na Bláth, stopping by at the Inniscarra Agricultural Show for good measure. When he became Taoiseach, Harris promised to bring “a new energy” and to “hit the ground running”. On that, at least, he has been as good as his word. But what does it all amount to, all this criss-crossing the country, the social-media updates (“Hi! Just keeping you up to date on some of the things ...”), the constant media appearances? “I think it’s really important that politics, politicians and Government reconnect with the public,” he says when we meet in his office in Government Buildings this week in his first big interview with a newspaper. “And I feel very strongly about that. I work very hard. But I think in addition to working very hard behind the desk or working very hard in an office, I do think it’s also important, to bring the office of Taoiseach out and about around the country to listen and engage with people. And that’s very much part of my style as a politician.” It’s not all just running around the country, he says. He rattles off a number of decisions his Government has taken – on the Stardust victims, Palestine, support for small business, disabilities and so on. Harris has brought empathy to these issues, but most of them were already in train when he took over. And he acknowledges that a significant part of his job was to “keep the show on the road, to ensure this Government serves out its mandate”. The other part of the job, he says, “beyond that, will be to go before the people of Ireland and outline to them where I want to take Ireland over the next five years, should they give me a mandate to do so”. “People want to know: what are you going to do? How are you going to fix the housing crisis for once and for all? What is the scale of ambition that you have? Where do you want to bring childcare? How are you going to get on top of migration?” His approach in Government so far, he says, has been to “bring people together, bang heads together, come up with solutions and say: ‘Hang on, don’t be saying that’s a matter for another department’. “The people of Ireland want to know what are we going to do to fix X issue. So that’s the sort of approach that I intend to take,” he says. “And I have a number of big ideas, many of which will be for my manifesto, whether that’s around disability, whether it’s about how we reform childcare, whether it’s about how we actually show the people of Ireland that we can sustainably fix housing in terms of delivering 250,000 more homes over the next five years, the tax reforms that I think we have to make, how we can use the tax credit system in terms of supporting people with the cost of raising a family and indeed the cost of caring for a relative. So there’s a number of areas that we’re working on currently.” In a speech to the MacGill summer school last month, Harris spoke about pragmatism as a key political virtue for him – the sort of “what matters is what works” approach favoured by both Barack Obama and, earlier, Tony Blair. But what are the objectives that he wants to be pragmatic in achieving? What does he believe in politically? “It’s really simple for me,” he says. “Every child in this country has to be able to reach their full potential regardless of their background. And it’s something I’m absolutely passionate about. “I’m influenced by my own upbringing, by how I was reared,” he says, reflecting that “a stone’s throw from here today, there would be babies born in Holles Street Hospital ... for a moment in time, everything is equal.” “I think the job of government is to make sure that it is a force for good in terms of their progression through life. And I think we should never be prisoners to ideological labels. I think we live in a wealthy, prosperous, successful country. This is a great country. I passionately believe that. I love this country. And we have so much to be proud of. But. But it is still an unfinished republic in terms of reaching its full potential. “And I want the grounding principle that I believe in is equality of opportunity and making sure that the Government can be a bridge to overcoming gaps that can exist. “So on a domestic level, the country that I want to live in is one that uses its resources to make sure that if you want to work hard, if you’re willing to play by the rules, that you can reach your full potential ... On a more macro level, I want this country to proudly continue to be pro-European, outward looking, a believer in multilateralism.” He pauses to reflect that “the main opposition party in Ireland has voted against every referendum in Europe, including the one to join it” before going on to hint that he is mulling the establishment of a State-run early childhood education service. “I can’t give the whole manifesto away today ... [but] what’s our vision for early childhood education? We have done a lot around reducing the cost of education, the cost of childhood care, that’s important. But, you know, should early childhood education be part of that, be a part of the education system in a more formal way?” For all the ready citation of the achievements of the State and the Government, Harris acknowledges – when the experience of children with scoliosis is put to him as an example – that the State’s provision has failed many people. “And we need to continue to be restless every single day in wanting to do better in all of these areas. And I’m restless. That’s the sort of person that I am,” he says. The Government will deliver the budget on October 1st. It will be Harris’s first as Taoiseach and this Coalition’s last. He acknowledges that for all the customary secrecy and behind-closed-doors wrangling, a package of similar structure and size can be expected this year. There will be tax reductions, permanent spending increases, including in social welfare rates, and there will be package of “one-off” (for the third year in a row) giveaways – “all of which,” he adds, “will be delivered this year”. This is necessary, he says, because cost-of-living pressures on people continue to be acute. “Because the cost-of-living crisis is still very real for people who say to me, hang on a second, I’m working really hard. But the cost of A, B and C is still very high and a hell of a lot higher than it was in the not-too-distant past.” A fourth element, he says, will be a package of infrastructure-spending increases funded by the proceeds of the State’s ownership of AIB, currently sitting in the Government’s strategic investment fund and amounting to about €2 billion. He wants to look at that to help meet infrastructural deficits in the areas of “water, energy and housing”, he says. In the future, he would like to see a dedicated Department of Infrastructure to manage spending in the area. He is proud that Anglo-Irish relations have been improved, though in reality the change of government in Downing Street had more to do with that than the change in Government Buildings. He is pleased with the pledge by new UK prime minister Keir Starmer to repeal the controversial Troubles legacy legislation, which protects former British soldiers from prosecution and annoyed all sides in Northern Ireland. Harris says the Government will drop its legal action against the UK government over the legistiation in due course. On a possible future united Ireland, Harris strongly defends the aspiration, but does not see planning for a referendum – as urged by Sinn Féin and civic nationalist groups – to be an immediate priority. “I think the most important thing we have to do right now is not just make preparations for anything, but actually get on with utilising the [Belfast] Agreement to bring about its full potential,” he says. On the conflict in Gaza, he is critical of the EU but does not see scope for Ireland to take unilateral action against Israel. And then there is the issue of when the next general election will be held. “So I smile when I’m asked this question for two reasons. One, the only people who ever ask it to me are journalists, and the odd colleague ... I don’t think any member of the public has ever asked me: ‘When are we going to have that election?’ And that’s the truth,” he says. “The second thing is, you will recall that I became the Taoiseach in April and you will recall the leaders of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party at the time, their kind of one demand of me was that I would commit to this Government running its full term into next year, and you will also recall because it was widely reported on at the time that I, of course, agreed to that. “And we haven’t had any further conversations in relation to it. So, that is, my position hasn’t changed in relation to this.” Does it matter whether the next election is in November or in March, the latest point at which it can be held at the end of the five-year Government term? “Well, it seems to matter to you,” he says. “And I don’t mean that rudely, but it seems to matter to political journalists who like to ask the question, and pundits and commentators. “I think people are quite happy for this Government to go full term. That is the intention, the publicly expressed view of the three parties in Government. I take the other party leaders at their word, that that is their wish. They asked me to give them my word, so that was my wish. We have all done that.” This appears to leave open at least the possibility – should his Coalition partners wish to discuss it – of an autumn election. In reality, that is the expectation of just about everybody in Irish politics. Either way, expect Harris to be on the road again.",0,1
2024/8/26,"No consent asked of Irish Government by Israel for military flyovers, Taoiseach and Tánaiste say Comments follow reports that three cargo planes carrying munitions for Israel travelled through Irish airspace in 2024 No consent has been sought from any Government department for overflights of weapons being used in the conflict in Gaza, Taoiseach Simon Harris has confirmed. Mr Harris was asked about media reports that three flights carrying munitions for the Israel Defence Forces have flown over Irish sovereign airspace this year. The online news site The Ditch has reported that almost 65 tonnes of military material has been carried on the three flights. It has based its reporting on documents released by Belgian authorities to an NGO located in Antwerp. Mr Harris said on Monday that he had sought clarification from the relevant Government departments in relation to the reports. He indicated that no consent had been sought for any overflight carrying military materiel from the Israeli authorities. “My understanding of the situation is that there are very clear consent protocols that would need to be followed for that to happen. “And my understanding from the Department of Transport and the Department of Defence is that no such consent was sought,” he said. Tánaiste Micheál Martin has also confirmed that no consents were sought. In a statement a spokesman said: “All foreign military aircraft wishing to overfly or land in Irish sovereign territory are required to obtain diplomatic clearance. “Such clearance is subject to strict conditions, including that the aircraft is unarmed; that it carries no arms, ammunition or explosives; that it does not engage in intelligence gathering; and that the flight in question does not form part of a military exercise or operation. “This diplomatic clearance procedure is fully compatible with Ireland’s policy of military neutrality.” The spokesman said the carriage of munitions of war was prohibited on any civil aircraft in Irish sovereign territory/airspace unless an exemption was granted by the Minister for Transport, under air navigation orders. “We are aware of media reports regarding civil aircraft flights to Israel. In 2023 and to date in 2024, no applications have been received or exemptions granted for the carriage of munitions of war on civil aircraft to Israel,” he said.",0,1
2024/8/26,"Tax on hoarded land to take effect from early 2025 with working farms excluded Minister for Finance Jack Chambers proposes deferral of levy for 12 months but compromise reached by Coalition parties The Residential Zoned Land Tax will go ahead from early next year following a compromise reached between the three Government parties, Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman has said. Earlier this month, Minister for Finance Jack Chambers announced that a tax on hoarded land would be deferred for a year over fears it would be punitive to working farmers whose land was zoned as residential even though they had no intention of selling, or developing, their holdings. However, the proposal to defer the tax was opposed strongly by the Green Party. On Monday, Mr O’Gorman, the Green Party leader, said it was his view the tax would go ahead in early 2025 as planned and would not be deferred. He said the three Coalition parties had agreed in recent days that the wording would include a clear mechanism that would exclude working farms from the scope of the tax. The issues is now being considered by Mr Chambers in the contest of the Budget. Mr O’Gorman said the three parties had agreed that where farmers are farming land at the moment and intend to continue to do so into the future, this tax would be designed not to affect them. “That was never the plan. We need a clear carve-out. We need a clear mechanism so they’re excluded from the application of that tax.” Mr O’Gorman said he had spoken to Mr Chambers during the weekend on the matter. He said that the Department of Finance and Office of the Attorney General were working on a solution. “We want to ensure that at the budget, we see a tax on land hoarding implemented, and ensure that where people have land that’s zoned, that’s serviced, that they are either building it themselves or allow somebody else to build it because the scale of the housing crisis is too great for us to allow the land to stay idle.” He continued: “Now they will either start to pay 3 per cent [of the value] which is quite a significant tax, or else build it.” He said the Green Party was disappointed to see that tax deferred last year. “We think it’s really important that it is implemented,” he said. Mr O’Gorman was speaking at the launch of the autism action plan in Government Buildings. Taoiseach Simon Harris, who also attended the event, said there was not a “clear landing zone” concerning the residential zone land tax. “It’s important to remember that all three parties in the Cabinet collectively decided that this was a good measure. It is in the Housing for All strategies. I very much welcome the fact that also there’s clarity across all parties and across the Government that this tax was never about active farmers; and I’ve been very clear with farmers … and with the IFA that this is not about targeting active farmers. “I do want to see the land hoarding tax progress with active farmers excluded because it is important that we move forward in relation to this.”",0,1

2024/8/27,"Bank levy: A change to €200m fee for 2025 has yet to be decided, says Jack Chambers Minister for Finance confirms bank levy to be extended for another year Minister for Finance Jack Chambers has yet to decide if he will vary the total levy on the three main banks from its current level of €200 million during 2025. Mr Chambers said on Tuesday that the level, first introduced in 2014, will be extended for another year. He said he had yet to decide on the exact make-up and composition of the levy but made a specific reference to the high profit levels of the banks, which have partly derived from the hikes in interest rates over the past few years. The levy, which generated circa €150 million each year, fell to €87 million in 2022 when Ulster Bank and KBC left the Irish market, leaving only the pillar banks: Bank of Ireland; AIB; and PTSB. However, former minister for finance Michael McGrath announced in the Budget last autumn that the levy was being increased to a total of €200 million for the three banks based on their increased profitability. Confirming on Tuesday that he is extending the levy for a further year, Mr Chambers said: “Banks in our country today are highly profitable and are benefiting from the stable and positive economic position we are in now. “I think it is entirely appropriate that banks continue to make a contribution back to the State in this context.” He said the exact scale of the level would be a decision for the Cabinet as part of Budget 2025, which will be unveiled on October 1st. Sinn Féin spokesman on Finance Pearse Doherty called for the banking levy to be increased to €400 million due to soaring bank profits from rising interest rates.  “Banks have seen their profits and interest income reach eye-watering levels as households struggle,” he said. “While so many households have seen their income squeezed as their mortgage repayments rise, banks have announced large payouts to their shareholders.” The bank level was introduced a decade ago after banks began to return to profitability after the financial crash. During that time the State provided €64 billion in recapitalisation funding to five banks: AIB; Bank of Ireland; PTSB: Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society. The rate of the levy varies each year with the aim of garnering circa €150 million in revenue for the State. It was reduced to €87 million in 2022 with the exit of KBC and Ulster Bank from the Irish market. In that year AIB paid €37 million; Bank of Ireland paid €25 million; and PTSB paid €22 million. Mr Chambers has yet to indicate if he will push for an increase in the levy, given that the profitability of banks remains high. In his statement he defended the continuation of the levy: “I think it is entirely appropriate that banks continue to make a contribution back to the State in this context. The return generated by the levy will provide me with additional scope on ensuring there is a substantial income tax package and options on further reducing the tax burden for families and workers as part of Budget 2025. “I am acutely aware that many people are still struggling with the cost of living and providing additional support is a key focus for me and for the Government in the upcoming Budget.” Following the statement, there has been a call for non-traditional banks to be included in the levy. Wicklow Fine Gael councillor Peter Stapleton said online banks should be brought within the scope of the levy. “The levy should be broadened and super-levied on to the online banks to try to force them to have branches and offices in Irish cities, towns, villages and communities,” he said. “The absence of physical branches from towns and villages is denuding communities,” he said. He said Bankinter and other new entrants to the Irish banking market such as Bunq, Revolut, N26 and others were welcome but they have come to the State because it is profitable. “If online banks are only to take the upside of profit, it is ultimately bad for communities in Ireland,” he said.",0,1
2024/8/29,"Colum Eastwood steps down as SDLP leader saying it is time for ‘change’ Claire Hanna, MP for South Belfast and Mid Down, considered to be among the front runners to be the party’s new leader SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has pledged to focus on “making the case for a new Ireland” as he confirmed his resignation after almost a decade in the role. Speaking at a press conference in Derry on Thursday, the Foyle MP formally endorsed party colleague and fellow MP, Claire Hanna, to succeed him, describing her as “far and away the best option”. Against the backdrop of the city, Mr Eastwood (41) told journalists it had been “the privilege of his life” to serve the people of Derry, and a “great privilege” to lead the SDLP for nine years after joining the party in his early teens. As the second longest-serving leader after John Hume, he added that it was time for him to step aside and give someone else a chance to re-energise the party. Mr Eastwood insisted it was “absolutely” his own decision to leave. He will continue as MP as well as working with the New Ireland Commission, a body he set up to look at Irish re-unification. “The bottom line is that this last few years has been a period of immense change across these islands,” he said. Acknowledging the recent electoral difficulties experienced by the party and the “middle ground generally”, he said the post-Brexit era was a period of instability but also “a moment of opportunity”. “This is now also a moment, I think, of big change for this island and I for one want to give my full commitment to leading in that space. I want to be a voice for leading for change, to develop a new Ireland,” he added. “I need to be able to have the space to do that, the time to do that, and some people don’t realise the effort you have to put in to the day-to-day running of a political party. “The moment now has come for me to step aside and let other people take on that mantle and to allow myself actually to focus on things, primarily to represent the people of this city but also making the case for a new Ireland, the work that I am very passionate about.” Mr Eastwood became the party’s youngest ever leader in 2015, after a tight leadership contest against Alasdair McDonnell. Once the biggest nationalist party at Stormont, the SDLP was relegated to fifth place overall in the last Assembly election two years ago – leaving it without a sufficient number of seats to take a ministerial post in the Executive. It is now forms the Opposition, headed by MLA Matthew O’Toole. Mr Eastwood will formally resign at the party conference on October 5th to allow the new leader to take up post. Ms Hanna, who is MP for South Belfast and Mid Down, was not present at the press conference in Derry but is understood to have unanimous support within the party, with one veteran saying “there will be no leadership contest this time, it will be a coronation”. Asked about who his successor might be, Mr Eastwood told reporters he had “absolutely no doubt” Ms Hanna had what it takes to be an SDLP leader. “If this is my opportunity to be the first person to endorse Claire Hanna I’ll absolutely take it. It’s up to Claire but I hope she puts her name forward.” Taoiseach Simon Harris paid tribute to Mr Eastwood, describing him a leader who “served with distinction” and with a “progressive, responsible and pragmatic voice on all issues, but especially the challenging ones”. “As a leader he has been accessible, on the ground and close to his constituents in Derry and the issues that affected them,” he said. “During Brexit, Colum served the entire island of Ireland with distinction in Westminster with passionate, timely and informed interventions in debates that otherwise neglected the peace process. For that, we all owe Colum a debt of gratitude.” Stormont First Minister and Sinn Féin vice president Michelle O’Neill also paid tribute. “I want to wish Colum Eastwood and his family well as he steps down as leader of the SDLP,” she said. “We have worked together as leaders for many years now, to restore the political institutions in the North and in protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the all-island economy against efforts to impose the hardest possible Tory Brexit. “I look forward to working with his successor as leader of the SDLP in a constructive manner for the good of all our people.”",0,1

The German politician has been meeting commissioner nominees one by one from the first half of this week. Ireland has said it is interested in a finance-related role for Mr McGrath, who stepped down as minister for finance earlier this year to take on the EU job. However, the Government’s chances of securing a powerful commission position have been seriously dented by several factors. Ireland was one of the first countries to formally nominate its candidate for commissioner, without consulting with the commission president on who they planned to put forward. The Government ignored a request from Ms von der Leyen for countries to propose two names, with at least one being a woman so she could build a gender-balanced team of commissioners. Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs also voted against Ms von der Leyen in a European Parliament vote that confirmed her reappointment as president of the EU’s executive arm for another five years. In a statement, Mr McGrath said he felt the meeting with Ms von der Leyen this week “went well”. The Fianna Fáil politician said the pair had a “good discussion about the major challenges facing the EU over the next five years.” The meeting took place in the commission offices in the Berlaymont building in Brussels. Mr McGrath said during the meeting he set out what contribution he believed he could make as a commissioner. “I acknowledged the difficult task she has in considering all the competing demands when forming her Commission, and I assured her I would play a positive and constructive role as a member of her team, subject of course to the ratification process that lies ahead,” he said. Speaking earlier in Brussels on Thursday, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said Mr McGrath had been a “high calibre” nominee to put forward as Ireland’s next commissioner. The Fianna Fáil leader said there had been “no back and forth at a substantive level” with Ms von der Leyen on the Government’s pick before the Cabinet agreed to nominate Mr McGrath in June. “I think it was similar in the case of Phil Hogan, when he would have been nominated originally, there wouldn’t have been a back and forth before that I’m informed,” Mr Martin said. The details of the Coalition agreement, that Fianna Fáil would pick who to nominate for the EU role this time around, would have been flagged with Ms von der Leyen, he said. “The Government’s view is we have put forward a very strong nominee in the form of a minister for finance, with considerable executive experience, as minister for public expenditure before that,” he said. Mr Martin said he did not believe Ms von der Leyen would seek to punish Ireland when she decided what commission portfolio to allocate to Mr McGrath. EU countries have until Friday to submit their nominees for commissioner, with three countries still to announce their decision. Ms von der Leyen is continuing to interview the remaining candidates over the coming days, as she weighs up how to divvy out portfolios. A large number of other countries have also signalled their interest in securing a finance-related commissioner role. The nominated commissioners will then need to be confirmed in their roles by the European Parliament, with hearings expected to take place in October.",0,1
2024/8/3,"Simon Coveney: ‘Theresa May’s efforts on the Irish question should be recognised. Her successors didn’t share that’ The former tánaiste reflects on the ‘fun behind the craziness’ of Liz Truss, the ‘intellectual snobbery’ Enda Kenny faced, and Michel Barnier’s shock at the warm welcome he received on the streets of Dublin  Sitting outside a hotel in afternoon sunshine near Cobh, Co. Cork, Simon Coveney, who is stepping down from a political career after 25 years that saw him occupy some of the State’s highest offices, remembers his days dealing with Liz Truss. Today, Truss is best known for her disastrous 45 days as UK prime minister, and her subsequent incarnation as a beloved of the US alt-right movement, but Coveney got to know her when they were both agriculture ministers a decade ago. “I would have known Liz very well. She’s the kind of person who you get to know personally because her politics and her personality are very much intertwined. She is fun behind all of the craziness, sometimes,” says the Cork man, sitting outside a hotel in afternoon sunshine near Cobh. Walking through the House of Commons one day in the summer of 2022 as she prepared to challenge for the Conservative leadership, Coveney spied Truss sitting at one of the tables in the Portcullis House atrium. “I saw Liz in the corner. I went over to her and I could see her smiling as I was coming over. I said: ‘If you’re not careful now, Liz, I I’ll come back and endorse you in the Tory leadership race.’” “She went a little pale, before declaring with a laugh: ‘Nothing I’ve done to you in the past justifies you doing that,’” says Coveney about a politician whom he disagreed with on nearly every occasion they met, but one who could share a joke. The story – and Coveney is not comfortable telling stories about others, on or off the record – reflects much about the 52-year-old, who served as minister for foreign affairs for more than five years between 2017 and 2022. Politics, he believes, is about building links, even when there is little to bind people together. “You had to build relationships, with Boris Johnson, with Liz Truss, with Theresa May, with people like Jeremy Hunt and Philip Hammond,” he says. “And I did, I tried to build a relationship that was based on respect. It didn’t mean we agreed. It meant sometimes that we had difficult conversations. Sometimes very difficult conversations.” He has regard for Theresa May, another former UK prime minister, over her attempts to find a deal following Britain’s vote to exit the EU. “Her efforts to respond to the complexity of the Irish question should always be acknowledged and recognised, particularly in Ireland. To be blunt about it, she ended her political career trying to solve it,” he says. “She was taken out by many in her own party for trying to do it. We should appreciate the extraordinary political risks and ultimate political sacrifice that she made. She was very genuine. It came from a very good place in somebody who recognised that Britain’s decision over Brexit had consequences for their closest neighbour and that she had an obligation to address that in a way that was reasonable for Britain, but Ireland, too.” Coveney thinks carefully before his next sentence: “I don’t believe that her successors shared that same feeling of obligation to try to address the Irish question.” However, May’s understanding came after a series of “miscalculations” by figures in London that were based on a belief that Ireland “wouldn’t really matter” in the negotiations when they got down to the final calls. “That was the view that some people had – not everyone in London, by the way, and not everyone in the Conservative Party. But it certainly was the view of some. Some even said to me, ‘Surely, Ireland will leave now, too.” From the beginning the Irish government “spent time” talking to London and trying to understand its next moves, but equally it was made “very clear that this was not a bilateral negotiation”. This point was often not understood in London. Equally, he says, the direct stands taken by “a new generation of politicians”, including himself, then taoiseach Leo Varadkar and others who did not “see Britain as in any way superior to Ireland”. “I have been in university in the UK, have lots of friends there. Leo has a lot of friends, connections and family in London. So does Paschal Donohoe. We all respect and like Britain, but we see them as an equal partner,” he says. “We don’t see it as a country that if they threaten us, that we will kowtow to them. Taking that position wasn’t without risk, you know, and that risk was outlined to us by senior civil servants on more than one occasion.” However, a hard border with Northern Ireland was never going to be acceptable in Dublin. “We were damned if we were going to be the people that were going to allow that to happen, no matter what the consequence was.” The government would have collapsed if such a deal had been accepted. Even today, Coveney is still taken by the solidarity shown by other European Union states when London still believed the EU would “talk about the importance of the Irish problem for a while” and then abandon it. He remembers a meeting in Paris with the then French prime minister, Édouard Philippe: “He said: ‘Simon, stop selling the Irish issue to me. I know it, I understand it. We will be there for you, no matter what.’” Sometimes the human connection matters in politics. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, came to Dublin in 2019 for an Ireland-France rugby international at Lansdowne Road. “We walked down to the match. He was amazed that he could walk on the main streets without any security or anything, because senior political figures in France just can’t do that,” he says. “All these Irish people kept crossing the road to come over and slap him on the back, saying: ‘Good man, Michel, keep it going,’” says Coveney. “He couldn’t get over it, that they knew him and that they wanted to make that connection.” Reflecting on his years in the Cabinet, the memory of the first meeting as the newly appointed minister for agriculture and food in Áras an Uachtaráin on March 9th, 2011, is still imprinted on his mind, coming in the wake of the economic crash. “I remember it vividly,” he says. “The country was in fear for what the future held. It was a dark time for many Irish people, their families, their businesses and for politics. Let’s not forget that.” Sitting around the table, Taoiseach Enda Kenny gave each of his new ministers a single page of paper carrying the bare details of the crisis facing the country: the jobs lost, the numbers who had emigrated, the cuts made. “He said: ‘I want everyone to read that.’ And then he said: ‘If anyone in this room thinks that we can’t turn those numbers around, there’s the door.’ And he pointed towards it. Even though we had heard the numbers, we were still shell-shocked,” he says. Today, he is occasionally in touch with Kenny. He still believes the Mayo man was treated “very unfairly” for much of his time in office. “There was an intellectual snobbery towards him in Dublin sometimes,” says Coveney. Kenny empowered people, he says. “The exciting thing about Enda was that when he gave you a job to do, he let you do it and he trusted you to get it right. ‘Here’s what we need to do, these are the numbers, now go and do it’ – that was his line.” Looking back, he believes the Labour Party suffered unfairly for the actions taken in 2011 as the government had to manage an international bailout. “Those actions were taken when the International Monetary Fund were calling the shots; people forget that,” he says. “People expected Fine Gael to make the hard decisions. It was harder for a socialist party. I remember that time and the brave decisions [Labour leader] Eamon Gilmore made and the decisions that [Labour minister for public expenditure and reform] Brendan Howlin made as well,” he says. “They paid the price, but the mistake Labour made was in not defending those decisions. Instead, they apologised, or semi-apologised for them. They were the right decisions at the right time and for all the right reasons, and they worked. “People give out about Garda numbers, but the IMF required us to cut them. As soon as we were allowed, they started growing again. Then, Covid happened,” he says. Looking on the Coalition partners he leaves behind, Coveney applauds Green Party leader Eamon Ryan. “When history is being written, he will be seen to be one of the most influential national politicians that Ireland has had during this decade,” says Coveney. “I think he’s changed the way the political system thinks, on climate and emissions, on ecosystems and nature. The Greens are always trying to push the boundaries, and I think that’s been good.” He decided “a few years ago” in conversation with his wife, Ruth, that he would not run again for the leadership of Fine Gael. Once he had done that, the question became when he would leave politics. “Honestly, she has always hated politics, finds it both stressful and very distracting for me and the responsibilities I have towards my kids and family. But she’s been incredible for 26 years, so, really, I’m forever indebted to her for that,” he says. Coveney is part of an exodus from the Fine Gael party. This week, Coveney’s party colleague Michael Ring, Fine Gael TD for Mayo, said he would not contest the next general election. This brings to 15 the number of Fine Gael deputies not running who were elected in the last election in 2020. Once Coveney had dearly wanted the Fine Gael leadership and still remembers the detail of the 2017 result that saw him lose to Leo Varadkar. “Leo got two-thirds of the parliamentary party; I got two-thirds the membership. We split the councillors half and half,” he says. The decision to quit completely was prompted by Varadkar’s decision to resign. Following that, he spoke to Simon Harris, “who was always going to win the leadership – everyone in the parliamentary party knew that”. “He wanted to refresh things. My decision made life a lot easier for him. I was comfortable with that. I could have lobbied hard to stay, making sure that Cork had a senior minister. Maybe, I would have been successful, but I didn’t want that,” he says. The leadership change has strengthened the Coalition, not weakened it, he says. “Fianna Fáil and Micheál Martin were remarkably patient and professional during that period, as were the Greens,” he says. “Fianna Fáil could have seen it as an opportunity, as weakness. Let’s face it, we are competitors as well as colleagues in Government at the moment. “To his credit, Micheál didn’t do that. He gave the party space. I would say that the Government parties are probably more trusting of each other now than at any point since the Government’s formation.” His next steps will come in the autumn. “Once I make a decision, I’m one of those people who look forward rather than looking back. I’m only talking about past stuff now because you’re asking me about it,” he says. “I am going to take some time for the family. But I’m excited about new challenges. I’m just looking forward to challenging myself in a new arena. And I will do that. I set targets for myself – I always have.”",0,1
2024/8/30,"Public faces State bureaucracy designed ‘around everyone but themselves’, Taoiseach says Simon Harris tells Kennedy Summer School he has low tolerance of bureaucratic reasons for delay or inaction   Government departments and State agencies too often avoid responsibility and leave the public facing bureaucracy that is designed “around everybody and everything but the citizen”, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. “That’s not intentional. It’s not on purpose. And I don’t say this to be disparaging, but if passing the parcel was an Olympic sport, we would be in with a chance of a medal,” he told the Kennedy Summer School in New Ross, Co Wexford, on Friday. Too often, he said, he finds that, in Government Buildings meetings with “fine people, excellent people”, someone will say that the issue under consideration is “a matter for this department or a matter for this agency”, but not themselves. “I have a very low tolerance threshold for somebody telling me that, you know, that there’s some bureaucratic reason why we can’t come together and fix this. You can’t boil the ocean, I get that,” he declared. “There are many parts of our system that work very well. But more and more, I think, when it comes to public policy and to delivery of issues, [issues] cut across narrow, neatly designed departments, agencies and structures. “The one thing that I’ve learned late, since becoming taoiseach in April, is that the job of a taoiseach in many ways is to try and overcome that. So you’re actually the only person in the Government who can pull all of the various strands together,” he said. Emphasising, if jokingly, that the next general election would take place “in March”, Harris said he has told every one of his Ministers that they are “the representatives of the public in their department, not the spokesperson for their departments”. “When I was in the Department of Health, I wasn’t there as a doctor. When I was in the Department of Justice, I wasn’t a guard,” he said, “You are there in a representative democracy to be the voice of your people. It’s my job to be a disrupter.” Meanwhile, speaking about the immigration debate, the minority of people who have sought to weaponise concerns about the issue do not represent the vast majority of the “decent” people in the State, he told the summer school. The amplification of angry voices on social media in Ireland and elsewhere is seen as evidence that “all of a sudden, we’ve lost that sense of meitheal, that we have lost that sense of community, or lost that sense of decency and respect”. Disagreeing sharply with that analysis, Harris, who was invited to be the subject for this year’s Noel Whelan lecture in honour of the late barrister and political commentator, said: “I don’t think that that is actually reflective of the overwhelming majority.” Following numerous trips around the State over the summer months, Harris told former senior X executive Sinead McSweeney, “my fundamental takeaway from this has been decency, that people are decent”.

2024/8/30,"EU-Israel trade agreement: Taoiseach seeks fresh legal advice on suspending deal Harris and Spanish PM previously asked Ursula von der Leyen whether Israel was in breach of agreement due to Gaza death toll Mr Harris and Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez earlier this year asked European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to review whether Tel Aviv was in breach of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which is conditional on respect for human rights, given the vast civilian death toll in Gaza. It comes after Tánaiste Micheál Martin said that Ireland will cease purchases of Israeli military equipment while ongoing contracts will also be put under review. Mr Harris said on Friday that people may be asking how the Government could take this action but not take action on the EU-Israel agreement, and this further prompted his decision to ask for fresh legal advice. The EU is Israel’s largest trading partner but there is no consensus, as of yet, on suspending the favourable terms under which that trade takes place. “Yesterday the Government made the appropriate decision to cease the practice of allowing any defence material or equipment be purchased from Israel. We did so grounded in the ruling of the ICJ earlier this summer. I have always said consistently that it is really appropriate and important that all countries and indeed the European Union use all levers at their disposal to push for a ceasefire,” Mr Harris said on Friday. “It’s not enough to say ‘I want a ceasefire’, you have to look at everything a country, and indeed the European Union, can do to create that environment in which a ceasefire becomes an inevitability because the humanitarian catastrophe cannot be allowed to continue.” “Myself and the Spanish prime minister continue to lead the charge that the European Union should review the association trade agreement between the EU and Israel. “I welcome the fact that a number of other member states support that position. I continue to advocate for it everywhere I go, including in my meeting with the French president in Paris this week. But today in light of the ICJ ruling this summer, I have written to the Attorney General to ask for fresh advice in relation to the broader issue of trade at an EU level, at an Irish level, where the competencies lie, and if anything has changed in relation to previous advice as a result of that ICJ ruling.” He said that trade is an EU competency, but he wants the updated legal advice before an upcoming European Council summit so that he can be prepared. “In the midst of one of the greatest humanitarian catastrophes of our lifetime, where children are dying and being maimed on a daily basis, where the world food programme cannot properly function, where we are seeing aid reduced and conflict spreading ... it is really appropriate that all governments including the Irish Government continue to probe what more can be done.”",0,1
2024/8/30,"Ireland will cease purchases of Israeli military equipment, says Tánaiste  Ongoing contracts to be put under review as violence in Gaza continues Ireland will cease purchases of Israeli military equipment and ongoing contracts are to be put under review, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has ordered, citing the continuing violence in Gaza. The move makes Ireland the first EU country to cease defence purchases from Israel since the war started almost a year ago. Ireland has a long-standing relationship with Israeli arms companies, with the Department of Defence awarding well over €20 million in contracts in the last two decades, including for drones, ammunition and radar systems. Israeli companies were also seen as a potential bidder for an upcoming €600,000 contract for 14 new drones for the Defence Forces. Mr Martin, who is also Minister for Defence, said neither this contract, nor any other, will be awarded to Israeli arms companies. In a statement on Thursday evening he cited the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory amounts to an illegal annexation. He said the legal consequences of the opinion are still being assessed but in the meantime it is not appropriate that Ireland “should procure military equipment or material from Israel”. Mr Martin said he has “directed officials in the Department of Defence to review defence procurement packages and to ensure that no such further procurement takes place”. Ireland’s only ongoing contract with Israeli arms manufacturers is a €295,000 a year contract with Aeronautics Defence Industries, a military drone manufacturer owned by the Israeli government, for maintenance of drones purchased for the Defence Forces. It is not yet clear if Ireland can legally cancel this contract or what implications that would have for its drone fleet. The Tánaiste’s comments mark a reversal from the position stated by the Department of Defence last week that Israeli companies remained eligible for Irish military contracts as the country is not subject to international sanctions. Ireland must conform with EU procurement rules, the department said. The Government now appears to consider the ICJ’s opinion as providing justification to effectively ban military purchases from Israel, said Tanya Lalor of Method Consults, which carries out research for NGOs and has recently analysed military contracts between Ireland and Israel. Ireland has an obligation under the Geneva Convention and the Genocide Convention to prevent breaches of violations of humanitarian law, including through the use of bilateral relations and trade policy, she said. The Government has also called for the EU-Israel trade agreement to be reviewed due to concerns over Israel’s actions in Gaza. However, not all member states support this. Speaking to The Irish Times yesterday, prime minister of Luxembourg Luc Frieden said: “I don’t think that is the appropriate way to proceed. “I think it must be part of a process of talking to both the Israelis and the Palestinians with all the complexities of who is on the Palestinian side to make progress there.”",0,1
2024/8/31,"Local authorities asked to audit all available land zoned and suitable for housing  Amid ‘grim record’ for homelessness, Minister for Housing seeks locations for residential developments As the number of people in homelessness reaches yet another “grim record”, the Government is appealing to local authorities to assess all zoned lands suitable for housing, and to determine whether further tracts should be zoned “residential”. Latest data from the Department of Housing, published on Friday, shows there were 14,429 people in emergency accommodation in July, including in excess of 4,000 children in more than 2,000 families. The figures represent the seventh consecutive monthly increase since December and the “devastating consequences of this Government’s housing failures”, said the Social Democrats spokesman on housing, Cian O’Callaghan TD. Sinn Féin spokesperson on Housing, Eoin Ó Broin, said: “Once again, another grim homelessness record has been reached under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.” Charities at the front line of the housing crisis said it was “wrong” that “thousands of kids have just started a new school year coming from emergency accommodation’' and urged the Government to do “much more… to protect children whose childhoods are being stolen one day at a time”. Friday’s figures also show the number of homeless adults surpassed 10,000 for the first time in more than a decade during the week of July 22nd-28th, when there were 10,028 adults and 4,401 children in emergency accommodation. There were 2,086 families accessing homelessness shelters. In addition, there were 6,573 single adults. These represent a 12.3 per cent increase in the 12 months since July last year, when there were 12,847 people in emergency accommodation, and compare with 14,303 people in emergency accommodation in June, including 9,899 adults and 4,404 children. The figures do not include homeless people in domestic violence refuges; those in direct provision centres who have leave to remain in the State but are unable to access housing; anyone sleeping rough; or the 2,577 male asylum seekers awaiting offers of accommodation. The new record comes as it emerges Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has written to all local authority chief executives telling them to estimate overall housing capacity of their zoned lands and to consider whether increasing zoned lands is required, and to start considering suitable locations for new residential developments. The Government’s draft revised National Planning Framework sets out that an average of approximately 50,000 new housing units per annum will be required to meet the country’s needs, says the Minister. He expects to finalise an update of annual housing targets by October and this will involve a “further step change in delivery utilising the public and private sector to fund and construct housing”, he adds. “An important facet of reaching that level of output is ensuring that there is sufficient zoned and serviced land available at suitable locations to facilitate the development of housing and sustainable communities. In the period pending finalisation and approval of the updated National Planning Framework, it would be appropriate for each planning authority to undertake a preliminary assessment of the quantum of zoned and serviced land within their administrative area that is available for residential purposes and to estimate the overall housing capacity of such lands,” the Minister says in his communication. Following this assessment, where it was considered there may be a need to increase the amount of zoned and serviced land, “it would also be appropriate to start considering the most suitable locations… and to commence undertaking the supporting assessments that will be required for the process of reviewing statutory development plans to give effect to updated targets,” says the Minister. Any future proposals relating to the zoning of land “must be evidenced-based, justified and consistent with relevant national and regional development policy,” he continues. “In this regard, I would note that the assessments should have regard to the quantum and rate of take-up of zoned and serviced land on the one hand, and suitability on the other, taking account of the settlement hierarchy; servicing requirements and transport accessibility, in particular accessibility to high-capacity transport options; environmental considerations and community and sustainable development considerations of any new lands to be considered.”",0,1
2024/8/6,"Help to Buy scheme extension sought in Budget 2025   Minister for Housing also expected to ask for hike to cap on price of homes eligible for scheme beyond current €500,000 Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is pushing to extend and expand the State’s Help to Buy scheme beyond 2025, well into the lifetime of the next government. The current scheme is due to expire at the end of next year, and Sinn Féin has promised to dismantle the arrangement – which critics say is driving house prices up – if it is returned to government following the next general election. However, Mr O’Brien is understood to have identified an extension to the scheme as a budget priority for his department, although it is formally administered by the Department of Finance as it is a taxation measure. The scheme offers a tax rebate to first-time buyers, worth up to €30,000. It is also expected that he will seek an increase to the cap on the price of homes eligible for the scheme, currently fixed at €500,000, in October’s budget. A source said the goal would be to introduce regional variations on the cap, which has been in place since 2016, in recognition of price differences in different parts of the country. In a pre-budget submission, estate agent Savills called for the threshold to be raised from €500,000 to €614,000 for homes in Dublin, citing increases in construction costs and consumer inflation since it was initiated. The estate agent also called for the scheme to run until December 2028. Housing is expected to be a central issue in the election campaign – now expected to kick off in earnest once the summer break is concluded and speculation mounts about an autumn contest. Sinn Féin is set to unveil its full housing strategy in early September. In its affordable housing plan published last week, the party pledged to deliver 50,000 affordable rental and purchase properties. Rents would be €1,000 per month while affordable purchase units would come in at no more than €300,000. A higher grant for refurbishing derelict properties is also expected to be on Mr O’Brien’s budget wish list – and if not included in October, it is likely to feature in Fianna Fáil’s general election manifesto. Those buying a vacant home can avail of grants of up to €50,000 to invest in the property - or €70,000 if it is certified as derelict. It is understood that an unpublished review of the scheme has recommended that the higher limit for derelict homes should rise to €80,000. A further increase in the renters’ tax credit – currently set at €750 – is also on the cards, with one source saying the goal would be to hike that to at least €1,000. With the Cabinet not set to meet until September and the Dáil in its summer recess, Ministers are working on their budget asks over the break. Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke is expected to seek an increase in the R&D tax credit and an extension of existing schemes, while both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have targeted an overhaul of inheritance tax, pushing for the threshold over which 33 per cent capital acquisitions tax (CAT) must be paid to increase by up to €65,000. Currently the tax is levied on inheritances over €335,000. A range of once-off payments are expected, including double child benefit and various disability and age-related benefits, while revisions to the universal social charge are also being considered. Another round of electricity credits has been mooted, as has a VAT cut to broadband bills.",0,1
2024/8/8,"Donohoe downplays suggestions of substantial cost-of-living package in October’s budget Minister for Public Expenditure says Government would continue to help families address the impact of high prices Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has downplayed suggestions of a substantial cost-of-living package in the budget in October by emphasising the sharp drop in inflation during the course of the year. Mr Donohoe said there would be a package as prices were still high and the Government would continue to help families address the impact of the cost of living. However, in an indication that the package will fall short of the €2.7 billion announced in one-off measures in last October’s budget, Mr Donohoe said the rapid decrease in inflation would have an impact on the scale of the spending package when Budget 2025 is announced on October 1st. “Because inflation has come down so quickly, it will have an impact on the nature of possible new measures that we will enact come budget day,” he said. The Minister was speaking in Government Buildings on Thursday at the launch of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report. There have been a number of such once-off packages in recent years prompted by hikes in energy prices, inflation increases, and general price increases. There was a €2.2 billion allocation in the Budget in October 2022, and a further €1.2 billion package in February 2023. The measures were partly financed from windfall income, including higher-than-forecast corporation tax receipts. Mr Donohoe said that the size of the package would be agreed by the three Coalition parties in September. “We are now in an economy where inflation is about 2 per cent and not 10 per cent. Of course, that will influence the decisions that we will make, but we have yet to make those decisions,” he said. Measures announced in the package in last October’s budget included a €300 lump sum for those entitled to fuel allowance, a €200 sum for pensioners, people with disabilities, or receiving a living alone allowance, and a €400 cup sum to those receiving the Working Family Payment. It also included a double payment of Child Benefit to support all families with children. Asked about data that showed 20 per cent of rented accommodation in Dublin was being provided by corporate landlords, and the number of small private landlords had all increased, Mr Donohoe argued that it showed the measures to incentivise small landlords introduced by the Government had worked, rather than the measures being unnecessary. “The measures that we were brought in to support the private rental sector were about retention. It was about trying to keep private landlords within the rental sector. And I think it’s very positive news that we are seeing an early sign of even a potential increase of the number of smaller landlords within our economy.” Mr Donohoe said his main concern was adequate rental supply. “We have always argued that you need a mix,” he said. “If we want to provide a lot more rental properties, we need investors and companies who can deal with that scale. And the corporate sector is the only way that that can be done.” He said the increase in smaller private landlords was a “very positive sign”. “We need a diversity of provision ... We need smaller landlords but we also need large investors who can provide rental accommodation at scale,” he said.",0,1
2024/8/9,"Road safety: Small ‘correction’ to law could be ‘game changer’ in dealing with disqualified drivers Amendment to Road Traffic Act would allow gardaí instant access on whether motorist disqualified, uninsured or carrying penalty points A “small correction” to road traffic legislation could have significant repercussions for disqualified and uninsured drivers, allowing gardaí “real-time” access to motorists’ information and capacity for full enforcement of the law. The amendment to the 2023 Road Traffic Act, which comes into effect on December 1st, will require all motorists to supply their driver number as well as licence number to insurers before they get cover. Drivers have a unique number held for life, separate from a licence number which changes on renewal. At present, motorists are not obliged to provide their driver number, despite it being listed on their licence. The change is expected to make the process of verification more effective and allow gardaí instantly check a car licence plate with all up-to-date information. It will also prevent drivers who pay insurance monthly and then cancel payment once they receive an insurance disc, from illegally driving with an up-to-date disc. Susan Gray, of the Parc road safety group, said the changes would be “a game changer” in terms of how insurance works, but it needs to be properly overseen and enable gardaí to have “real-time” information rather than facing a lag. “The fear of getting caught for disqualified drivers is slim and they believe if they produce their licence that they’ve held onto there’s nothing on that licence to alert the gardaí that they’re disqualified,” she said. Ms Gray said between 9,000 and 10,000 drivers annually are disqualified in the courts, but just 3 per cent of learner drivers and fewer than 10 per cent of fully qualified motorists surrender their licence to the courts. In correspondence with Parc last month, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan’s office confirmed the “capture of driver number with policy details” was an outstanding issue and the provision required a “small correction, which was made in the Road Traffic Act 2024″, after the development of software and implementation of data protection measures. The “capture and verification” of driver numbers, not traditionally taken by insurance companies, will start on December 1st with transmission to the Irish Motor Insurance Database, run for insurance companies by the Irish Motor Insurance Bureau. . Insurance Ireland chief executive Moyagh Murdock confirmed that insurers have in the past 12 to 18 months been contacting policyholders and collecting driver numbers in advance of the measure coming into effect. Brokers will now be required to do the same before December 1st. Meanwhile, gardaí will be “duty bound” to investigate reports of bad driving made by members of the public via a new online portal. The “Traffic Watch” reporting form — garda.ie/en/trafficwatchreport/ — opened on Thursday and replaces a 20-year-old phone line previously used for reporting non-emergency traffic incidents, which received 45,000 reports over the last decade. The new system relies on a “partnership approach” with all road users and aims to improve driver behaviour and reduce road collisions, said the Garda. Supt Liam Geraghty said the initiative sends a signal to drivers that just because they cannot see a garda on the road “this does not mean that somebody is not watching you or that somebody is not prepared to stand up and say that is irresponsible; that is unacceptable”.",0,1
2024/9/1,"Defence co-operation vital in wake of Ukraine invasion, Luxembourg PM says Luc Frieden praises value of collective EU defence ahead of meeting Taoiseach and Tánaiste in Dublin  The invasion of Ukraine has made greater co-operation on defence in the EU necessary “not only in the future but already now”, the Luxembourg prime minister, Luc Frieden, has said in advance of a visit to Dublin on Monday. Mr Frieden is due to meet both Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin on his first visit to Ireland since he replaced Xavier Bettel as prime minister of the Grand Duchy late last year. In an interview with The Irish Times, Mr Frieden said: “It goes without saying that individual member states in Europe can neither defend themselves nor defend a neighbour with their own national means only. So therefore I strongly advocate closer co-operation in Europe on defence issues, together with strong co-operation with the United States. “In Ukraine we are defending the basic principles on which Europe was built after the end of the second World War and the end of the cold war – that is, that borders cannot be changed by force. And those things you cannot do alone, you need to do them together with others.” Mr Frieden declined to be drawn on questions about Ireland’s neutrality. “Every country has to decide for itself what is the appropriate alliance in which it decides to organise itself,” he said. “I honestly don’t think it is for other countries to tell another country what it should do.” But he notes that Sweden and Finland, previously neutral, have now joined Nato since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “They changed their mind but not because it was imposed by others but because they came to the conclusion that they should join Nato. So again, every country has to decide on the basis of its history, its geographical location and on the basis of its defence needs whether it joins a military alliance or not. “Let me tell you that Luxembourg was neutral until the second world war,” he added. “That neutrality was violated by Nazi Germany and we were very grateful for the Americans to have liberated Luxembourg together with some allies. And it was on that basis that we took the decision to join Nato.” Asked what had been the experience of a small country in Nato, Mr Frieden said  Luxembourg knew  very well “that we cannot defend ourselves alone… so it is for us the fundamental guarantee that if ever again anyone was to attack Luxembourg, our allies would be there to help defend us. “And that is also why, despite the fact that we are small, we are present when others call for our help, and that is much appreciated by our allies. “We had soldiers in Afghanistan, we had soldiers in Kosovo, we have right now soldiers on the east flank of Nato. Not because we think we can make the big difference, but we know and our allies appreciate the fact that we are there and our flag  next to their flag shows we are united in defending fundamental values. So our experience has been very positive.” Mr Frieden ruled out joining Ireland’s call for the EU to review the EU-Israel trade agreement. His stance will be a blow to Ireland’s efforts to persuade EU countries to review the EU-Israel agreement as a result of Israel’s military actions in Gaza. But Mr Friedan hailed relations between the two countries “It’s very important the prime ministers of like-minded countries get to know each other,” he said. “Ireland and Luxembourg have a lot in common…  We are interested in cross-border services, we are interested in international trade, we share on many issues the same values – the rule of law, these kind of things – so the second objective [of my trip] is to try and build an alliance, and a stronger alliance within Europe between Luxembourg and Ireland.” Like the Irish Government (and everyone else), Luxembourg did not accede to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s request to nominate a man and a woman for the country’s representative on the next commission – the idea being to ensure gender balance. “First of all, diversity is very important for government, for the European Commission. But diversity is more than just men and women… I looked at a number of candidates that have been proposed – they have different ages, they have different professional and educational backgrounds, there will be a number of men and women, so I think diversity will be in the next commission.” Many people in EU capitals regarded Ms von der Leyen’s  request for two nominees as infringing of the national governments’ right to select their representative. But Mr Frieden declines to go there. “No… that is not the way prime ministers – at least those that I know – talk with president von der Leyen.”",0,1
2024/9/10,"Vaping crackdown: why are ‘serious restrictions’ being rolled out? ‘Hundreds of thousands’ of children have become ‘hooked’ on vapes, posing a risk to their health, while there are also environmental concerns It’s rolling out “serious restrictions” including the banning of disposable vapes and restricting the sale of flavours and prohibiting point-of-sale advertising displays. Smoking kills thousands of people in Ireland every year and is financially ruinous, meaning the “better than” bar is very low. Vaping advocates say the products do less harm than tobacco and contains fewer deadly chemicals – notably tar. “I see vaping as the revenge of the tobacco industry in terms of getting people hooked on nicotine again,” Tánaiste Micheál Martin said last year, a view echoed by Taoiseach Simon Harris this week. A position paper from the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland’s faculty of paediatrics described vaping as harmful with significant long-term health risks for children and young people, whose brains and bodies are still developing. It is sometimes marketed as a cessation device, but also as a fun product. One well-stocked shop visited by The Irish Times was selling flavours such as fusion berry and lemonade, cherry cola, watermelon, triple mango, peach ice, gummy bear, fresh mint, kiwi passion guava ice, banana blast and cotton candy ice. According to some estimates, there are as many as 16,000 different flavours on the market. It does. And we haven’t got to the colours. All the colours of the rainbow are represented. It’s a far cry from the drab colouring and the choking smell of Major or Rothmans many of us once knew. Indeed. The vaping sector says it does no such thing and it is illegal to sell vape products to minors. Big time. “It’s the biggest spread of addiction this country has ever seen,” one whistleblower within the industry told The Irish Times last year. “Hundreds of thousands of children have been hooked.” About 13 per cent of people between the ages of 12 and 17 had vaped in the last 30 days, according to HSE research from 2022, and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said this week that “companies are very cynically targeting children ... We know a lot of the colouring and the packaging is targeted at children and young people”. Very. In the 12 months to the end of May 2021 there were 5.6 million units of vape sold in Irish shops. In the year to May 2022, the total jumped to 8.06 million and by the summer of last year the figure had more than trebled to 26.3 million sales. That would account for some of the growth but the numbers don’t add up as more people are taking up vaping than are stopping smoking. No. There are also environmental concerns, particularly when it comes to disposable vapes which sell for less than a tenner. Many are imported from China, so there is a carbon footprint element, but of more concern perhaps are the very small lithium batteries which, if not disposed of correctly, can leech into the ground and leave behind toxic residues. Vapes also contain manganese, nickel and cobalt, which could all be reused but often are not. As many as 10 per cent of the population now vape with two-thirds saying they disposed of vapes incorrectly, with nearly half wrongly thinking they could be just thrown in the bin.",0,1
2024/9/11,"Concern in Coalition at fallout from €13bn Apple tax ruling Minister for Finance pushes back against idea ruling could make Ireland a less attractive place to invest The Government is scrambling to control the fallout from the Apple tax ruling after the Court of Justice of the European Union found the computing giant must pay €13 billion to Ireland. Senior ministers insisted the future risks to Ireland’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) model were limited, but some within the Coalition say there are concerns it could add to headwinds for investment in Europe and Ireland from overseas. Minister for Finance Jack Chambers pushed back against the idea it could make Ireland a less attractive place to invest. “I don’t believe it does, because it relates to historic and legacy tax provision.” But one Government figure described it as a “blow to the FDI friendliness of Ireland”, coming against a backdrop where the State is facing shortfalls in infrastructure which have resulted in negative decisions for some multinational projects in recent months. There was concern in some quarters that the decision would have implications in the boardrooms of US companies when deciding where to invest, with Europe facing strong competition from other markets, and companies likely to factor in the possibility of retrospective interventions when making decisions. “Europe needs to be competitive and stop the naval gazing,” said one senior Coalition figure. Mr Chambers said Ireland is “very much in line with the multilateral system in the EU, within the OECD” and was a “constructive contributor” to international corporation tax reforms introduced in recent years. However, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Ireland and a small group of other European countries appeared to still be “central” to efforts by multinational corporations to move profits to favourable tax jurisdictions. She told The Irish Times that it was “very difficult” to say what implications the court ruling had for the corporate tax payments of other multinationals who may have availed of similar arrangements to Apple in the past. She added that any future examination of Apple’s current operation in Ireland would be a matter for her successor. Mr Chambers said he was not aware of any other potential investigations into past tax operations of companies in Ireland. One experienced FDI executive said the ruling was historic and that the direct impact was negligible, but nonetheless deemed the development “not positive from a reputational perspective”. They said it would be a “negative talking point” in a context where Ireland’s offering had become “less attractive on a number of fronts” in recent years, although this would be offset to a degree by the vigour with which Ireland defended the case. The finding also raises the question of what to do with almost €14 billion, when interest is included, that will now flow into the exchequer, with Taoiseach Simon Harris saying the ruling brought “finality” to the saga. He said it would not be used for day-to-day spending, as ministers said it would not change budget arithmetic for next year. Further talks are expected between Coalition leaders and ministers in the coming weeks, with Mr Harris saying “careful consideration” should be given on how to utilise it for Ireland. Cabinet sources said ministers had agreed not to “fly kites” on what it could be used for in their departments. A senior source acknowledged that “people will want the €13 billion today”. The opposition was quick to pile pressure on the Government to deploy the cash, as well as heaping criticism on successive administrations for fighting the court case and siding with Apple. The total amount available to Ireland has come down by €455 million after some was repatriated to other countries’ tax authorities for tax due there in recent years, with a possibility more claims could follow.",0,1
2024/9/11,"Weather changes but Simon Harris looking to election on horizon Fine Gael needs to provide details of proposed new State-run early education and childcare service to give it credibility  Taoiseach Simon Harris had not long started his remarks to the media outside the Tullamore Court Hotel on Wednesday when the dark clouds gathered and a downpour began. This forced the Taoiseach, his handlers, the reporters and camera crews scuttled inside to the ballroom to start over.  By the time he was halfway through, typically enough, the sun was blazing again outside.  Harris was peppered with questions on the issues of the day, on which he is seldom reluctant to comment (a tendency which reporters seldom object to). The Pat Finucane inquiry, the Apple tax case, the push to make religious orders contribute to the cost of compensating sexual abuse victims, the inadequacy (as he sees it) of the Sinn Féin housing proposals, and the timing of the election, inevitably, were all on the agenda. In another clear nod to Fine Gael’s policy plans for the election, Harris took questions on plans for a new State-run early education and childcare service. It now seems certain, having suggested the idea in an Irish Times interview last month, that he intends to make this a centrepiece of the Fine Gael election offering. For now, we have yet to get past the stage of ‘wouldn’t-this-be-a-great-idea’. But if fleshed out and implemented, it will be a multibillion euro commitment, and a potential game-changer in early-years education. That will take the hard policy work of detailed planning, crunching the numbers and finding the money. That’s the only thing that gives a policy credibility. Otherwise it’s just a vague election promise. Selling that message will be the Fine Gael ministers – their black Audis ostentatiously arranged outside the hotel front door – and TDs and newly selected candidates who gathered in Tullamore. Addressing the faithful in the Faithful County at the outset, Harris told them “Fine Gael is a party that always puts people before politics”. Observers of a certain vintage will remember that slogan “People before Politics” was the one used by a young Bertie Ahern in his first election as leader of his party. Five years later, running for re-election, Ahern used another slogan, a version of which is used by every incumbent government party that is running for re-election: “a lot done, more to do”. It means you stand on your record, but not just on your record: you have plans for the future. You are not complacent; you know that elections are more about the future than the past. Whether voters judge Harris’s plans for the future to be credible and deliverable will determine whether he gets a second term as Taoiseach.",0,1
2024/9/11,"Apple tax: Taoiseach suggests funds could go towards infrastructure and housing European Union ruled computing giant must pay €13 billion to Ireland on Tuesday Some of the State’s €13 billion windfall from the Apple tax case could be targeted towards infrastructure and housing, the Taoiseach has suggested. The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled on Tuesday that the computing giant must pay €13 billion to Ireland. Simon Harris said the Government needed to hold a discussion on the most appropriate way to use the windfall and said that there would be scope to use it “in the interests of the Irish people now and into the future”. Speaking during a two-day Fine Gael parliamentary meeting in Tullamore, Mr Harris said the judgement this week had drawn a line under the court proceedings and there was now finality to the decision. He also gave the first indication of the Government’s thinking as to where some of the money might be targeted. “I think there are clear areas where it would merit consideration around infrastructure, housing, and other areas where there are constraints,” he said. “I don’t think it’s useful for everybody to make lots of different suggestions. I think what is most useful is that Government, in due course, calmly considers the matter of the most appropriate use of these resources in the interest of the Irish people, our country and our economy. And I’m sure there’ll be many projects, many areas that will fit that bill” He said that it would take some time for the funds to be transferred to the Exchequer. Once this happens, the Government would have options but the money would not be used on any recurrent spending, he added. “It can’t be spent on day-to-day stuff because it is once-off in nature.” Earlier, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has said the Apple funds should be invested in infrastructure such as housing. “The Government, in a very considered way, will discuss and decide how that money would be spent, obviously, because it’s a one off tax receipt. I think my own view is it should be invested and it would be invested in infrastructure, housing,” he told Newstalk Breakfast. The Government would reflect on the issue, he said. Investment in the Climate Fund would also be examined, but discussions would be held with Government colleagues before a pathway forward was decided On RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, the Minister said that the focus for the Government at present was Budget preparation, but the Apple judgment had been accepted. “I think to be fair, most people understand the Government would prefer to assess the decision, and we will as a collective decide how best that money can be invested and should be invested. We’re investing significantly in housing already,” he said. “Certainly I think from my own perspective, it would make absolute sense that with the additional windfall that in the future we would look at how we would invest that in infrastructure, including in housing as well. “We’re investing this year the highest amount that we’ve ever done as a state in housing. And thankfully we’re seeing a significant increase in the outcomes in housing across all of those points. Significant challenges still remain. And I’m acutely aware of that.”",0,1
2024/9/12,"Ireland’s competitiveness should ‘never be taken for granted’, Minister says after Apple warning Other countries are trying to lure multinationals away from Ireland, tech giant told the Government in June Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke has responded to a warning from Apple that other countries are trying to lure multinationals away, saying Ireland’s competitiveness should “never be taken for granted”. The Irish Times reported on Thursday that Apple warned the Government that “Globally there is aggressive competition from countries trying to secure large multinationals, such as Apple, to relocate from Ireland to their shores.” The warning came during a meeting between Apple and Mr Burke in June. A Department of Enterprise note of the meeting – released under the Freedom of Information Act – shows Apple did brief Mr Burke on its growth plans in Ireland. But the company – which employs more than 6,000 at its European headquarters in Cork – also complained about infrastructure in the city including the road network as well as highlighting the need for an “adequate bus service”. The meeting was told “the slow progress regarding the public infrastructure in Cork is very worrying and hindering Apple growth plans”. During an interview on Today FM’s The Last Word programme, Mr Burke was asked about Apple’s warning about Ireland’s competitiveness. He said: “Every economy has challenges and I think Ireland can manage the challenge that it has.” Mr Burke that is why there was a memo to Cabinet this week on measures to maintain Ireland’s competitiveness while insisting Ireland remains either at the top or near the top of competitiveness tables compared to other countries. He said: “We never should take that for granted and that’s why we’re really looking to invest in our grid, to invest in our water and waste water and to ensure that we have very solid next-generation sites to attract new investment into the country.” He added: “Competition is very strong globally… and that’s why we need to refocus Government on delivering large-scale projects that are going to improve our infrastructure and make us more competitive.” Asked about Apple’s complaints about infrastructure in Cork, Mr Burke said infrastructure had been improved significantly, citing wastewater capacity, broadband and third-level institutions. When asked if this was not related to the roads and public transport in Cork, he said the point he was trying to make was it was “impossible for a country to deliver everything at once”. “There are competing interests… We are doing a huge amount for Cork and the greater area.”",0,1
2024/9/12,"Decision on Apple windfall spending must  be made before budget, Government sources say The €13 billion from the Apple case will not be available to use until March, while further €3 billion from sale of AIB shares is also available A decision will need to make on what to do with a €16 billion windfall largely derived from the Apple tax judgment within the next three weeks, Government sources have indicated. In addition to the €13 billion from the Apple case being added to the exchequer, the State will also be in receipt of an additional €3 billion for divesting some of the shares it holds in AIB bank. “They will have to identify [where the money will go] pre-budget,” said one source with knowledge of discussions. The Apple windfall will not be available to the State for use until March. The Irish Times spoke on Wednesday to a number of sources in Government from different departments and from each of the three Coalition parties. It is understood that no substantive discussion at Government level has yet occurred but such conversations would begin in earnest over the coming week. There was general agreement that only a portion of the windfall would be spent directly, with some at least being earmarked for a sovereign wealth fund, or a rainy-day fund. No decision has been made on how much will be allotted to this fund. Some of the State’s biggest and most pressing infrastructure requirements could benefit, sources indicated. Housing was the area that was primarily identified, in addition to water infrastructure, the national grid and roads. Projects that could benefit from investment include the new proposed water supply for Dublin from the river Shannon; an ambitious expansion of the national energy grid to accommodate new sources of power including offshore wind energy and providing capacity for data centres; and specific funding for the biggest Land Development Agency projects. Fine Gael strongly supports the establishment of a department of infrastructure, although there is less enthusiasm for the idea within Fianna Fáil, where some expressed a view that it would duplicate the work of existing departments. Speaking at Fine Gael’s two-day meeting in Tullamore on Thursday, Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said he sees “huge merit” in a new department of infrastructure. “There is a significant amount of new infrastructure the State does need to build in the years ahead. That’s where the real money will be spent. Having a minister whose job it is to look at that infrastructure is something other countries have done and have done well.” Mr Donohoe indicated that some of the windfall would be put aside into a fund and also emphasised that none of the money would be used for ongoing expenditure. “We need to ensure that we don’t fool anybody into thinking that we can use this money to pay for expenses and to pay for wages that will recur again and again in the future. This is a once-off amount of money that we get to spend once. “We need to spend it wisely on things that can shape the future of the country.” Speaking from the meeting Taoiseach Simon Harris and Mr Donohoe indicated the money would be directed primarily at housing, energy, and water. Separately, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien also said he would like to see a substantial spend on housing and is understood to be preparing a case to make to Cabinet colleagues this month.",0,1
2024/9/12,"Apple warned Government of ‘real threat to Ireland’ from countries trying to lure multinationals away Company also raised concerns in the summer about infrastructure issues in Cork, including inadequacy of road network and bus service Apple warned the Government of “aggressive competition” from other countries trying to lure multinationals away from Ireland during a high-level meeting this summer. The tech giant flagged what was described in Government notes of the discussion as “a very real threat to Ireland”. Apple raised concern about infrastructure issues in Cork, where its European headquarters is located, saying it is “hindering” growth plans and it also highlighted delays securing work visas for staff. The meeting between Apple’s vice-president of European operations Cathy Kearney and Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke took place in June as the final outcome of the long-running Apple tax case saga was awaited. The European Court of Justice this week ruled in favour of the European Commission in its bid to make Apple pay €13 billion in back taxes to Ireland. A spokesman for IDA Ireland – which had a representative at the meeting in June – said the case was not discussed during that engagement in Government Buildings. A Department of Enterprise note of the meeting – released under the Freedom of Information Act – shows that several other issues were raised by the Apple representatives in attendance. It says Ms Kearney congratulated Mr Burke on his recent appointment as Minister and “gave an overview of the company, its facilities, investments and growth plans both in Ireland and globally”. The Apple side is said to have told the meeting: “Globally there is aggressive competition from countries trying to secure large multinationals, such as Apple, to relocate from Ireland to their shores.” The next sentence is redacted and the note continues: “This is a very real threat to Ireland with Apple Finance areas looking into the prospect of moving staff. Due to digitalisation this type of reorganisation is much easier to do.” Apple declined to comment on this, and the meeting in general, but pointed to its more than four decades in Cork, the more than 6,000 people it employs there and the construction of a new facility for 1,300 employees due to open next year. According to the meeting note, Apple also raised how “the slow progress regarding the public infrastructure in Cork is very worrying and hindering Apple growth plans”. The document says: “The current roads network is not sufficient to enable 6,000 Apple employees on their daily commute and is also a struggle for the residents, with traffic and transport situation being so bad. The meeting heard “an adequate bus service is also required”. Separately, Apple is said to have welcomed a Government announcement that immigration administration functions would move from the Garda to the Department of Justice in relation to non-EU nationals living in Cork and Limerick. The meeting note says: “Due to large delays in securing visas for staff, the company had many issues with WRC [Workplace Relations Commission] inspections” and that the announcement “should resolve this in future”. According to the note Mr Burke told the Apple representatives that Ireland “is a great place to do business, with a competitive tax landscape, R&D investment incentives and Government are looking to keep improving in these areas”. Mr Burke said “the Irish Government has always supported Apple and will continue to do so as they are a key employer”. He asked Apple to send examples of the issues it highlighted and said his officials “will ensure their concerns are brought to the direct attention of the relevant personnel”. Mr Burke also said he would “follow up” with Government colleagues on issues outside his Department’s remit. Separately, on Wednesday Taoiseach Simon Harris said the Government needed to hold a discussion on the most appropriate way to use the €13 billion windfall from the Apple tax case, suggesting it could be targeted towards infrastructure and housing.",0,1
2024/9/12,"Apple’s warnings and gripes are part and parcel of a multinational’s close contacts with Government Ministerial lobbying by big corporations with large Irish operations are commonplace in a State that leans heavily on foreign direct investment  There is nothing unusual about executives from multinational companies like Apple engaging with new Irish Government ministers. Given the revenues that flow into the exchequer from tech and pharma giants – and the many thousands of jobs they provide in Ireland – it is no surprise there is fairly frequent correspondence and meetings with senior political figures. While the relationship between the multinationals and the Government is often warm, with congratulations flying upon the election of new taoisigh or ministers, the contacts from the companies can also come with warnings and gripes. These are certainly evident in the Government’s note of the discussions in June between Apple representatives, including vice-president of European operations Cathy Kearney, and the then recently appointed Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke. It was not all bad news for the Government at the meeting. Ms Kearney is said to have spoken about Apple’s “growth plans both in Ireland and globally”. However, the Department of Enterprise account of the meeting also details a warning from the Apple representative about “aggressive competition from countries trying to secure large multinationals, such as Apple, to relocate from Ireland to their shores”. According to the note, the Apple representatives also suggested “slow progress” on infrastructure such as the roads network feeding its Irish base in Cork was “hindering Apple growth plans”. It is not the first time Apple has raised infrastructure issues with the Government. The Irish Times previously reported that at a meeting with then-taoiseach Leo Varadkar in 2017, Ms Kearney outlined challenges Apple was facing on the cost and availability of accommodation for its employees. Apple is not alone among tech companies raising issues with the Government. During a meeting with Mr Varadkar earlier this year, Amazon expressed doubts about its “capacity to expand” its cloud computing presence in Ireland because of difficulties connecting new data centres to the electricity grid. Meta previously repeatedly lobbied the Government to ensure that Ireland’s new online services watchdog, Coimisiún na Meán, was fully staffed and resourced. The Government has insisted this week that Ireland remains attractive for foreign direct investment (FDI), despite the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling on the Apple state aid case, which means the computing giant must now pay Ireland €13 billion in back taxes. The Government said it would “respect” the court findings, while saying “the Irish position has always been that Ireland does not give preferential tax treatment to any companies”. Apple said after the ruling, “We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal.” On Tuesday, Minister for Finance Jack Chambers pushed back against the idea that the outcome of the Apple tax case could make Ireland a less attractive place in which to invest. He also said that a competitive tax rate was just one part in Ireland’s success in attracting FDI. It is an argument the Government consistently made as it participated in global tax reforms that saw the end of Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate for the largest companies. Mr Chambers this week highlighted a talented, well-educated workforce and Ireland’s place “in the heart of Europe” among other reasons for Ireland’s success in securing FDI. That may all be true but there are some within Government who are concerned after the Apple ruling. One source described it as a “blow to the FDI friendliness of Ireland” coming against a backdrop where the State was facing shortfalls in infrastructure. Introductory meetings between multinational companies and new ministers, the kind that occurred between Apple and Mr Burke, may be routine. But the details that have emerged from his discussion with Apple suggest that jitters about the future of multinational investment in Ireland are not without some foundation.",0,1
2024/9/13,"Cross-Border co-operation to ensure mother and baby home records in North can be found Issue featured during meeting of North South Ministerial Council in Dublin, the second in less than four months The Government is to co-operate with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the records of victims of mother and baby homes held in Northern Ireland can be found and that survivors avoid taxes on redress payments. In November 2021, the Stormont executive agreed to set up a public inquiry into institutions that existed to house unmarried mothers in Northern Ireland, along with agreeing to make redress payments, potentially to thousands of survivors. However, many of those who should qualify for Stormont compensation were held in homes run by institutions controlled in the Republic, raising questions about the ability of investigators to get records needed now. In addition, some likely to qualify for Stormont compensation are now living in the Republic, so an agreement with Dublin will be needed to ensure that redress payments are not taxed, or do not impact on welfare benefits. The issue featured significantly during a meeting of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in Dublin Castle, the second in less than four months for a body that has been frequently suspended because of collapses in the Stormont institutions. The mother and babies’ homes were run by religious institutions that operated across the island, said Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O’Neill: “So, there was a lot of movement.” “It’s important in terms of record maintenance, etc, that we have very strong joined up approach to ensuring that when it comes to getting access to individuals’ information, that we have the maximum information to give to them,” she said. Supporting the First Minister, Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said “a number of issues” have arisen since the decision was taken to have a statutory inquiry in Northern Ireland into the homes. “Many of the institutions in the north operated across the border,” she told journalists in Dublin Castle, “So, we want to make sure that those participants in this inquiry can get full access to the records, [including] medical records,” she said. Women from Northern Ireland were held in homes in the Republic, and vice versa, while often the babies of many of the women were sent across the Border, if they themselves were not. Technical changes are needed to ensure that tax and welfare benefits problems do not arise. “We want to co-operate to make sure, absolutely, that those women and those born in those institutions get the justice that they deserve,” Ms Little-Pengelly said. The detail of the issues outstanding was discussed in a meeting in Dublin Castle between the First and Deputy First Ministers and Minister for Integration and Children Roderic O’Gorman. Promising assistance, Taoiseach Simon Harris said officials would work to ensure that the taxation and welfare issues raised by the First and Deputy First Ministers will be fixed, along with the questions raised about records. “We’re certainly willing to be as helpful and co-operative as possible, because at the end of the day there were babies and mothers wronged on this island, and it was wrong. They didn’t recognise borders or partition,” he declared. Unlike some previous meetings of the NSMC, the atmosphere during the three hours of talks at Dublin Castle were friendly, and engage, with people “fulsomely co-operating”, to quote Mr Harris. Ministers spoke, too, about increasing cross-Border co-operation to counter climate change and biodiversity loss, along with reviewing the ongoing construction of the Narrow Water bridge between Louth and Down and the restoration of the Ulster Canal. Noting the improved change in mood, Ms O’Neill said: “We now have an opportunity that comes with the reset [in relations between Dublin and London] to get back to the principles of the Good Friday [Belfast] Agreement.” Saying that it is “crucially important” that the Republic and Northern Ireland work together cooperatively in ways that “can benefit both of our peoples”, she said actions can be taken jointly to improve prosperity, to grow the economies.",0,1
2024/9/13,"Office of Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman criticised for breaking Freedom of Information rules Minister’s department refused to acknowledge or reply to application from The Irish Times for referendum papers  The office of Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman has been criticised for breaking Freedom of Information (FOI) rules when it blocked a request for Government files on the care and family referendums. Mr O’Gorman, now leader of the Greens, was chief sponsor of two referendums that were rejected overwhelmingly by the electorate in March. The result dealt a severe blow to the Coalition, a fortnight before then taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was resigning. A 73.93 per cent majority rejected amendments to “strive to support” care and delete mothers’ duties from the Constitution and 67.69 per cent rejected proposals to recognise families in “other durable relationships” in addition to marriage families. The refusal of Mr O’Gorman’s department to acknowledge or reply to an application from The Irish Times for referendum papers came as FOI files from other departments called into question the Minister’s claims about the proposed amendments. FOI bodies are required under the Act to determine requests within four weeks or to issue written notification if more time is required. Now a binding ruling from the Office of the Information Commissioner has compelled the Department of Equality to consider afresh the news organisation’s FOI application, saying the original decision to refuse access to the files was “not justified”. The commissioner carries out independent reviews of FOI decisions by public bodies. Mr O’Gorman’s department failed to reply to the original request within the statutory period set out in the FOI Act and failed to hand down a determination when The Irish Times sought an internal review of the lack of response. Almost three months passed before his department finally replied, under instruction from the commissioner, but access to the files was blocked because the request was voluminous. “The department’s processing of the applicant’s request in this case fell well short of the requirements of the Act,” said Stephen Rafferty, a senior investigator with the commissioner’s office. “This office is aware of a number of similar recent situations involving the department and has made arrangements to follow up on these issues with the department’s secretary general,” said Mr Rafferty in a binding ruling on Friday. The ruling annuls the decision handed down by Mr O’Gorman’s department, which on May 31st suggested the request made almost 13 weeks previously on March 3rd should be refined. Although the request was made five days before polling day, the department’s decision meant none of its records were released to The Irish Times at a time when files from other bodies undermined Government campaign claims. Mr O’Gorman cited advice from the Attorney General when questioned about disclosures from other departments. Even though Ministers claimed the family referendum proposal had no tax implications, Revenue officials warned of potential tax law changes. Although Mr O’Gorman claimed the proposals would have no “legal impact” on immigration law, justice officials warned the referendums risked creating prolonged “legal uncertainty” over migration. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe warned Mr O’Gorman of “extensive policy and expenditure risks” in the care referendum. In addition, Department of Finance files show the care amendment wording was chosen to “avoid a concrete and mandatory obligation” on the State. Asked about the commissioner’s ruling, Mr O’Gorman’s department noted the decision. “The department currently has a large backlog of Freedom of Information requests, in particular due to a very significant increase in requests related to international protection and the accommodation of beneficiaries of temporary protection.”",0,1
2024/9/14,"Jack Chambers interview: ‘There’s a small Apple every year now in surpluses in the Irish economy’ Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance on the challenges of putting together his first budget, which will include a €3bn injection for key infrastructure priorities Jack Chambers is the third Minister for Finance of this Coalition, following Paschal Donohoe and his party colleague Michael McGrath, who is now in the Brussels anteroom as he awaits appointment to the next European Commission. With an election due in months, Chambers will surely be the last. But if the personnel turnover has been brisker than usual in his office – as the portraits on the walls of the department attest, the Minister for Finance is a big political beast in any Cabinet, not usually or easily moved – the policy approach has remained consistent. So it will be with Chambers in the role. The October 1st budget from Chambers, a Fianna Fáil TD for Dublin West who was appointed Minister for Finance only in June, will follow the template of his two predecessors. He will unveil it with Donohoe, his upstairs neighbour in the Department of Public Expenditure (“an excellent colleague”). Public spending will continue to grow at a fast clip, fuelled by huge corporation tax receipts, though not fast enough for the liking of most Ministers. A chunk of those receipts will be diverted into the State’s long-term savings funds. There will be a package of tax cuts and of welfare increases; there will be another round of one-off giveaways, for the third year in a row. And there will be a boost to capital spending, funded by the proceeds of the State’s bank shareholdings. This was flagged by the Taoiseach a few weeks ago. Chambers, the man in charge of it, has firm numbers. “What I propose to advance is a €3 billion infrastructure injection to capitalise key strategic priorities, which is housing, energy and water in particular,” he tells The Irish Times in an interview in his Merrion Street office. “So really underpinning that future productive capacity of their economy, in housing, in water, in energy, is, I think, an important signal to the investment community.” This is not, he stresses, the Apple money – the €13 billion that Europe’s top court last week ordered the US tech giant to pay the Irish State after the European Commission successfully argued that Ireland had given Apple illegal tax advantages. What happens that money will be the subject of a separate process, presumably by the next government. He is adamant, though, that it should not be used to fund feckless election promises. “I mean, the most reckless thing to do with the Apple money would be to distribute it for day-to-day spending or to mismanage it [by] not having strategic focus for the long-term economic position of the State,” he says. The important thing, Chambers says, is to protect the economic and taxation model that has produced the huge corporation tax surpluses every year – and not just on a once-off basis, which he likens to a “small Apple every year”. “The wider reaction on how a one-off payment can solve every problem presents economic risk. And if you look at how Ireland has a current surplus, and indeed, we expect to have significant additional surpluses in the years to come, the measure of fiscal responsibility and economic management will be how we manage that,” he says. “Like, there’s a small Apple every year now in surpluses in the Irish economy.” What of the fallout from the European Court of Justice judgment? He has come, he says, from a meeting with some “global tax leaders, who are Irish based and are working within the multinational sector”. They spoke about “how Ireland has changed out the corporate tax regime in the last decade”. Successive governments have vigorously pooh-poohed the notion that Ireland was some sort of international tax bandit. But they also point out how much Ireland has changed the practices of the 1990s and 2000s. Will the European Commission now go back and check the Revenue’s homework from that period in the wake of the Apple case? “There’s no live or active case that we’re aware of from the European Commission, and obviously we’ll monitor that,” Chambers says. And at what stage would the Government become aware of such a case? “Well, that’s a matter for the European Commission, but very much, Apple was a specific case with a specific operation and an assessment around state aid relevant to our legislation at that time, which went back decades,” he says. It was, he says, “very specific to Apple”, though he concedes that the Government has insisted that although it was only Apple, it was not a sweetheart deal for Apple. “We’re not aware of any wider implications at this point,” he says. There’s the inevitable, drive-by pop at Sinn Féin, the main Opposition party to the Government. “I think there’s a core recklessness, particularly to how Sinn Féin have responded with raw populism. First of all, in saying that they would abandon our industrial and enterprise model and also abandon the necessity for Ireland to defend our position on tax policy and tax legislation,” he says. Later, he returns to the theme, asserting that Sinn Féin “would spend the benefits of our economic model” while simultaneously blowing it up. “They would raid Ireland’s future,” he says. That’s the choice, he asserts, at the next election – between Sinn Féin’s “populism” and the “strong centre” of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. He plays down the recent scratchiness in relations within Government. The coming weeks will be dominated by the budget. He summarises what will be in that package quickly: €1.4 billion in the tax package – “very limited scope”; new spending of €1.8 billion to €1.9 billion – “very limited rooms for Ministers”; half of that to go to the social welfare package. It’s the eternal refrain of the Department of Finance seeking to downplay the spending demands around the Cabinet table. Once-off giveaways, he says, will be “not on the scale of last year”. He returns again and again to the need to invest in infrastructure. The Coalition’s third minister for finance will be the third to smash its own fiscal rule of increasing spending by only 5 per cent a year, ignoring warnings from the State’s budgetary watchdog, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. Chambers argues that the spending rule has been “an important anchor of fiscal discipline, despite the 5 per cent not being achieved”. But surely then the real rule is not 5 per cent, it’s 6 and a bit per cent, or it’s as close to 5 per cent as you can manage. “There’s an important context to that. We have had to respond to significant cost-of-living pressures that families, citizens and businesses faced and we have responded to an unprecedented cost of migration in our society. If we were to simply uphold the 5 per cent rule, we wouldn’t be able to invest in any public services,” he says. This is not unfair. Upholding the rule – effectively holding expenditure right down while running large surpluses – would probably not have been politically possible in the circumstances. But is it not really a rule if you break it all the time? The spending growth that builds a bigger State, he says, “as an end in itself isn’t what citizens want; they want better delivery of services”. Reforming public services is something we shouldn’t talk about only in times of recession and pressure on the public finances “which is the historic norm in our country”. “Part of the future will be, how do we examine our agencies, our systems that are getting expanded, bigger budgets, but we need to make sure, how are they connected so they deliver better for our citizens?” he says. “Because when you take, for example, a lot of the agencies that were established 20 to 30 years ago, their structures can be adjusted in the context of a different economy.” This sounds like he has an example on his mind. After some prompting, he cites the recent decision by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to allow energy prices to rise by €100 a year, while the Government is preparing to pay out energy credits to citizens. This is, he says, a “contradiction”. “The CRU are obviously operating within the framework that was set for them in a different regulatory era, which was very different in the context of renewable energy,” he says. The question is “how do we best reposition the various areas of our regulatory models, so that they obviously protect citizens, but secondly, that there isn’t that contradiction when it comes to public spending?” Colleagues say Chambers, at 33, the youngest Minister for Finance since Michael Collins, is bright, focused, courteous – and still learning how to do the job. He acknowledges that he came in “into the business end of the cycle”, but says “no role has ever phased me in politics or in life. I embrace it, always up for the challenge.” A keen runner, he is suffering from a stress fracture in his back. “It’s given me a little bit of pain over the summer.” He will have bigger pains before the autumn is out.",0,1
2024/9/14,"London’s abandonment of plans to fund Casement Park revival will come as no surprise Without the Euro 2028 target, a difficult job for the GAA becomes even more difficult amid objections that were both sectarian and practical The decision has been coming for weeks, surrounded by rumour and counter-rumour. Yes, the British government would pay the money to build Casement Park. Definitely, no questions. Then, no, they would not. On Friday, Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin and ministers met in Dublin Castle with Northern Ireland’s First Minister Michelle O’Neill, Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly and Stormont colleagues. If anyone knew anything about London’s decision to abandon plans to fund, together with the GAA and the Irish Government, the redevelopment of the west Belfast stadium, then they were not letting on. Questioned, Harris said he had spoken with British prime minister Sir Keir Starmer in Farmleigh about the project when they met in Dublin a week ago, but wanted to respect the fact that Starmer has “a huge array of issues” on his desk. “The prime minister didn’t give me an indication of a deadline in terms of when the British government would be able to make a decision, but he did certainly give me a clear understanding that he was aware of timing being important,” said Harris. In truth, few in Dublin will find the decision surprising: there have been rumours for months that London hoped Uefa would be the ones to pull the plug by excluding Casement from the list of stadiums for the 2028 European football championship because it could not be built in time. The derelict GAA ground had been earmarked to host five matches at Euro 2028, which will be jointly hosted by Britain and Ireland. Under Leo Varadkar, Dublin had offered €50 million under the Shared Island initiative to help the redevelopment, but construction costs rose from the original £125 million estimate to nearly £400 million – with no more clarity about why that has happened in Belfast than with public infrastructure projects anywhere else. The timing of the decision by No 10 Downing Street will be seen in Northern Ireland as important, since it comes just a day after London announced that it was finally accepting a public inquiry into the 1989 killing of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane. Of course, the timing could be entirely accidental, but that will not be believed in a place where, even 25 years on, good news for one side of the sectarian divide must always come with something on the negative side. The Democratic Unionist Party hated the idea, so, too, the more hardline Traditional Unionist Voice led by Jim Allister, pointing to the many gaps in Stormont’s public spending numbers. In truth, they would have hated it, anyway. Under Doug Beattie, the Ulster Unionists believed it should be redeveloped – though, not entirely unreasonably, he believed the GAA should pay more than £15 million for a new stadium that they would own. Some objections were deeply sectarian. Some, however, were not. The stadium plans were not universally welcomed by many of those living around it. Streets are cramped. Parking is at a premium. Crowded match days were always a pain. In addition, there were better places for Northern Ireland to have a world-class stadium – the bustling Titanic Quarter along Belfast Lough, or on the much-disputed lands that were home to the Maze Prison, 16km  south of Belfast. For now, the stadium that has lain idle for decades will remain so for years more. The 2028 Euros offered a target to bring it back to life. Without that target, a difficult job for the GAA becomes even more difficult.",0,1
2024/9/14,"Lobbying push from Irish officials amid speculation over Michael McGrath’s EU role Current speculation centres on Michael McGrath being in the frame for EU commissioner for justice or innovation job Michael McGrath has been in and out of the European Commission’s offices in the Berlaymont a number of times now, as he waits to find out what job he will be given as Ireland’s next EU commissioner. A lobbying push from Government Buildings and Irish officials in Brussels has been stepped up over the last fortnight, to try to prevent Ireland ending up with a lightweight portfolio. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has been drafting and redrafting the list of what portfolio she plans to hand to each EU country. While concrete details of the German politician’s thinking have been kept tightly under wraps, speculation is centring around Mr McGrath potentially being in the frame to be commissioner for justice, or the commissioner for research and innovation. An announcement revealing the commissioner roles had been expected earlier this week, before it was pushed out to Tuesday next week. Now it seems that deadline will be moved again. From the start, the Government said it was looking for a finance-related portfolio for Mr McGrath, given he is a former minister for finance, and before that minister for public expenditure. Prominent jobs in that area would include commissioner for the economy, for trade, for the internal market, commissioner for competition, and the job overseeing the EU budget. Officials expect those would either all be out of reach or are already promised to other countries. Commissioner for financial services, a more mid-ranking role held by Ireland’s outgoing commissioner, Mairead McGuinness, had been seen as a more realistic prospect. Mr McGrath has been over and back to Brussels several times since July. The former Fianna Fáil minister has had meetings with many of the current crop of commissioners in the Berlaymont, as well as a sitdown with Dr von der Leyen at the end of last month. Ireland has been linked with the commissioner job covering research and innovation, which would be in the bottom half of the table of portfolios. However, even for that there is competition. One Finnish official said Finland, which had previously been tipped for a role covering digital policy, now seemed to be angling for the commissioner for innovation job. Finland was also one of the few countries to put forward a woman, nominating Henna Virkkunen, a former minister and current MEP, as its pick. Another possible role mentioned has been commissioner for justice, which is responsible for leading the EU’s efforts to tackle breaches of the rule of law by member states, such as Hungary. The widespread belief among the Brussels circuit of politicians, EU officials and diplomats is that everything can still change. Privately, there is a recognition in Government Buildings that Ireland has not been in Dr von der Leyen’s good books of late. Dublin was among the first capitals to dismiss a request for member states to propose at least one woman nominee so the commission president could build a gender-balanced team of commissioners. Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs also voted against Dr von der Leyen in a European Parliament vote to confirm her reappointment for a second term. Both Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin have recently spoken to the commission president on the phone, making the case for Mr McGrath. It is understood other Irish officials have also sought to intensify representations. The plan has been to pitch Mr McGrath as a safe choice and someone who can be trusted with a potentially sensitive portfolio, according to two officials involved in the lobbying effort. The announcement of the commissioner appointments is being held up by a row in Slovenia. A spat over a late change in its nominee has led a parliamentary committee chaired by the opposition party to hold off on rubber-stamping the replacement. The delay will likely kick off a further round of last-minute lobbying, as each country tries to avoid losing any ground before Dr von der Leyen makes her final decision about who is getting what.",0,1
2024/9/15,"Limerick mayor highlighted concerns over proposed asylum seeker accommodation with Minister John Moran made urgent request to Roderic O’Gorman to be consulted on plans for River House in city centre, records show The Mayor of Limerick John Moran highlighted concerns over proposals for an asylum seeker accommodation centre in the city and made an urgent request to be consulted on the plans. Records released under Freedom of Information show that Mr Moran contacted Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman on the issue in July. Mr Moran, Ireland’s first directly elected mayor, assumed office after a vote by the people of Limerick in June. In letters to Mr O’Gorman, Mr Moran cited part of the legislation underpinning the office of directly elected mayor, Section 35, that entitles him to request consultation on ministerial policies that the mayor believes will impact on Limerick. On July 5th Mr Moran wrote to Mr O’Gorman about the Government’s strategy for housing international protection applicants and said: “I believe that your department is planning to utilise several large-scale properties in Limerick.” He said it is “of importance that we identify the areas to increase provision of additional supports for already constrained local services”. Mr Moran asked for “the opportunity to be consulted on the policy underlying these developments and initiatives, and whether there are better alternatives for Limerick”. He suggested meeting Mr O’Gorman when he was in Dublin on July 9th. Mr Moran sent another letter on July 10th to “highlight the high-level urgency on the Section 35 request”. He referred to reports about a proposed accommodation centre at River House on Charlotte’s Quay suggesting consultation is needed “to ensure social stability around the idea”. Mr Moran wrote: “This is a move by Government which people are upset and disappointed by. From my reading of the situation, this is primarily due to a lack of consultation with the people in the surrounding areas of the planned development, particularly in relation to River House, Charlotte’s Quay and shared by many of us in City Hall.” He said matter is “of such high-level urgency” that he raised it at his first meeting with Taoiseach Simon Harris. He asked that Mr O’Gorman’s office “make urgent contact with my office, to organise a call between both you and I.” The Department of Integration told The Irish Times that Mr O’Gorman and Mr Moran met in recent days. Its statement said the department is working with communities all over Ireland to source and provide accommodation for international protection applicants under Irish and EU law and “our humanitarian duty to provide shelter to people fleeing war and persecution”. It said Mr O’Gorman and Mr Moran discussed “a range of issues, including the well-documented shortages of suitable accommodation for international protection applicants, and the Government’s implementation of a Comprehensive Accommodation Strategy to address these shortages and build a sustainable system.” The department said two sites are currently being brought into use in Limerick city, at Ballysimon where a contract is in place and the Charlotte’s Quay location which is currently “being appraised by the department”.",0,1
2024/9/16,"Von der Leyen briefs Harris on ‘composition’ of EU commissioner jobs carve up Ireland nominee Michael McGrath believed to be in frame for EU commissioner for justice job European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has briefed Taoiseach Simon Harris on the “emerging composition” of the next commission, as she prepares to announce which portfolios each EU country will be given. Michael McGrath, Ireland’s nominee for its next EU commissioner, is believed to be in the frame to land the portfolio covering justice, according to several sources. Dr von der Leyen is pushing to reveal the portfolios she intends to hand out to her team of commissioners, who are put forward by each EU country, on Tuesday. The commissioner for justice is responsible for leading the EU’s efforts to tackle breaches of the rule of law by member states, such as Hungary and previously Poland under its populist former government. The role is currently held by Didier Reynders, a Belgian politician. Dr von der Leyen spoke with Mr Harris on the phone on Monday evening, as part of a series of calls placed to national capitals. During the call the German politician briefed the Fine Gael leader on the “emerging composition” of the team of commissioners, as the process of deciding on the allocation of roles “comes to the closing stages”, a Government spokesman said. Dr von der Leyen and Mr Harris have spoken “half a dozen times in recent weeks” about the commissioner jobs, the spokesman said. “The Taoiseach is happy with the overview he was given this evening and thanked the president for the meticulous work she has put into commission formation,” he said. Dr von der Leyen had been scheduled to announce the portfolios she will be allocating to each commissioner on Tuesday. The public announcement was due to follow the commission president’s briefing of the leaders of the eight political groupings in the European Parliament, during a meeting in Strasbourg. On Monday, France replaced its commissioner nominee, Thierry Breton, who had been due to serve a second term. In a resignation letter published on the social media platform X, Mr Breton claimed Dr von der Leyen asked France to withdraw his name and nominate someone else in recent days, in exchange for “an allegedly more influential portfolio”. Mr Breton, who had been commissioner for the internal market, had frequently clashed with Dr von der Leyen during the past five years. In his place French president Emmanuel Macron nominated Stéphane Séjourné, his close ally and the outgoing minister for foreign affairs, as the country’s new commissioner. The Government has always stated it would push for Mr McGrath to be given a finance-related commission portfolio. However, a number of factors had been working against Ireland securing a prominent economic job. The Government ignored a request from Dr von der Leyen for countries to propose two names, with at least one being a woman, so she could build a gender-balanced team of commissioners. Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs also voted against Dr von der Leyen in a European Parliament vote that confirmed her reappointment as president of the EU’s executive arm for another five years.",0,1
2024/9/16,"Plans for €2.5bn apartment remediation scheme to go before Cabinet  Arrangement to fund remediation of defects for between 62,500 and 100,000 Celtic Tiger-era apartments or duplexes Plans for a grant scheme of up to €2.5 billion to fix Celtic Tiger-era apartment blocks are expected to be considered by Cabinet this week. It has been estimated that between 62,500 and 100,000 apartments or duplexes built between 1991 and 2013 may be affected by fire safety, structural safety or water ingress defects. The overall cost of fixing the defects has been estimated at between €1.56 billion and €2.5 billion. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien opened an interim fund last December that is designed to pay for fire-safety measures to help owners of defective apartments in advance of the more comprehensive State support scheme which requires new legislation. Some 169 applications to the Housing Agency-administered interim fund – representing around 17,000 residential units – have been validated after meeting the eligibility criteria so far. There are further steps in the application process before funds can be drawn down. The draft heads or outline of the Apartment and Duplex Defects Remediation Bill are expected to come before Cabinet this week. Once approved, the heads are to be referred to the Oireachtas committee on housing for pre-legislative scrutiny and possible amendments before the proposed law is again considered by Cabinet and then by TDs in the Dáil. The timing of the general election is uncertain with much speculation centred on November, though Taoiseach Simon Harris has indicated repeatedly his intention for the Coalition to continue for a full term into early next year. The Irish Times understands Mr O’Brien hopes the full legislation for the defective apartments grant scheme will be before the Dáil within the lifetime of the current Government. The Coalition has previously sustained Opposition criticism for the pace of efforts to provide remediation for defective apartments. The Department of Housing has responded to criticism in the past highlighting the complexity of the issues involved and saying sufficient time is required to ensure the scheme is “fit for purpose” and “provides value for taxpayers’ money”. While the legislation was being developed a working group was set up to draft a code of practice for the remediation of the defects and it is hoped this will result in “speedier processes” once the full scheme is up and running. Under plans for the scheme, the grants will cover 100 per cent of eligible remediation costs in apartments and duplexes with Owners’ Management Companies funded to carry out the works. There will be provision made for retrospective payment of eligible costs already incurred in the fixing of relevant defects. The scheme will not apply to units or common areas wholly owned by a developer involved in constructing the building nor will it cover wear and tear deficiencies or those related to a lack of maintenance.",0,1
2024/9/16,"Taoiseach to hail ‘new era’ in British-Irish relations in Derry speech Simon Harris due to emphasise Government’s commitment to investing in the North’s future through the Shared Island fund The Taoiseach is expected to hail a “new era” in British-Irish relations in a speech in Derry on Monday. Simon Harris is due to undertake a number of engagements in what will be his first visit to the city as Taoiseach. In a trip focusing on North-South links, Mr Harris is due to meet political, civic and community leaders – including the mayor of Derry, Lilian Seenoi-Barr – and announce a branding collaboration between the Wild Atlantic Way and the Causeway Coastal Route, which runs along the Derry and Antrim coast. He will also visit the site of a new teaching and student services building under development at Ulster University’s Magee campus in Derry as a result of the Government’s Shared Island funding and deliver the John Hume and Thomas P O’Neill Chair in Peace lecture at the university. In his speech, the Taoiseach is expected to focus on the “new energy” in North-South and east-west relationships and emphasise his commitment to seeing the Belfast Agreement implemented “to its full potential”. He will praise the impact of recent meetings with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, which have set in motion a “much-needed reset of relations” between the two governments, and the restoration of the Northern political institutions and the relationship between the North’s First and Deputy First Ministers, Michelle O’Neill and Emma Little-Pengelly, which have “injected fresh energy into politics ... and opened new possibilities for North-South co-operation”. Mr Harris is due to emphasise the “renewed momentum in cross-Border collaboration” and the Government’s commitment to investing in the North’s future through the Shared Island fund. “Today, we are restoring a genuine sense of partnership, ensuring that together we address the critical issues that underpin lasting peace, progress and reconciliation,” the Taoiseach is expected to say. “The Irish Government is fully committed to strengthening relationships across all political traditions on this island, and to rebuilding trust where it has been eroded.”",0,1
2024/9/16,"Taoiseach ‘not ruling ... out or in prospect of additional Government funding for Casement Park Northern Secretary said stalled rebuild of Belfast GAA groundd would not be funded by UK due to risk of project not being completed on time The Taoiseach has said he is “not ruling ... out or in” the prospect of additional Government funding for Casement Park. Speaking to reporters in Derry on Monday, Simon Harris said the Government was “open” to continuing conversations around the redevelopment of the west Belfast stadium and stood “ready to assist in any practical way we can”. On Friday evening, Northern Secretary Hilary Benn announced the UK government would not fund the long-stalled rebuilding of Casement Park so that it could host matches in the Euro 2028 football tournament due to a “significant risk that it would not be built in time.”  Mr Harris said on Sunday that announcement “has been met with understandable disappointment”. The Irish Government, under the Shared Island initiative, and the GAA had said they would contribute to the redevelopment, but delays and spiralling costs created a funding gap. Mr Benn said on Friday the cost of building Casement Park had risen “dramatically” from when the tournament bid was awarded in October 2023 and now – from £180 million to £400 million. The Taoiseach is due to meet the GAA later this week. Mr Harris said he stood by the Irish Government’s commitment of €50 million and “what we now need to see is “what the British government and the Northern Ireland Executive want to do next. “I spoke to the president of the GAA yesterday, I’m hoping to meet the GAA in the coming days, I’ll stay in contact with the First and Deputy First Minister and with prime minister Starmer, but let’s now try and get a bit of forward momentum going on this once and for all. “What I’ve heard from everybody across the weekend is Casement is going to happen, Casement has to happen. The question is timelines and the question is, on what scale?” Mr Harris acknowledged the “real sense of disappointment” felt by many at the UK government’s decision, but said the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, had “inherited” the situation from the previous government and had given it “serious consideration.” “We have to, from this moment on, look forward in relation to the project,” the Taoiseach said. The North’s First Minister Michelle O’Neill called for a “Plan B” from the UK government, saying London had “wrapped [the funding] up as part of the Euros bid” and this had caused additional delays. “What we now need to see from the British government is, what is the Plan B? What is the contribution towards building Casement Park? “That is work that is going to have to continue because we have to get on now and get Casement Park built,” she said. Ms O’Neill also criticised the timing of it and other announcements on Friday evening, describing it as “absolutely shambolic”. “To bury bad news on a Friday evening, to hope that perhaps people wouldn’t notice – not good enough, not acceptable and not the way to do business,” she told reporters on Monday. The Minister for Communities, the DUP’s Gordon Lyons, told the Assembly the decision had been emailed to him at 6.32pm, approximately 40 minutes before the announcement was made public. “I think it was inappropriate what has taken place with the government, to put it mildly, over the last week in terms of announcements that are made,” Mr Lyons said. “I think it is right and proper that ministers are able to answer questions on this and that they are able to speak to the media, and neither of these things happened.” On Monday, Mr Harris undertook a number of engagements in Derry on what was his first visit to the city as Taoiseach. He met the mayor of Derry, Lilian Seenoi-Barr, at the Guildhall and visited the PSNI’s Strand Road police station before delivering the John Hume and Thomas P O’Neill Chair in Peace Lecture at the Ulster University’s Derry campus. In a trip focused on North-South links, he announced a branding collaboration between the Wild Atlantic Way and the Causeway Coastal Route, which runs along the Derry and Antrim coast, and visited the site of a new teaching and student services building under development as a result of the Government’s Shared Island funding. In his speech, he praised the contribution made by John and Pat Hume to peace as well as the “new era” in British-Irish relations. He told reporters he felt “very confident ... that I have a willing interlocutor in Downing Street in terms of making progress on peace and prosperity across these islands. “I can genuinely say that the reset is real, the reset is warm, the reset isn’t a slogan, because we’ve outlined the body of work that will now take place between now and next March’s joint summit between the two governments. “I actually believe we could be at the dawn of the best relationship we’ve seen between an Irish and a British government in very, very many years, and that excites me, it energises me, and I won’t allow any one individual decision to disrupt that reality,” he said.",0,1
2024/9/17,"Alan Shatter hasn’t ‘given thought’ to election bid as he seeks revolt over inheritance tax Former Fine Gael TD says he is ‘gobsmacked’ by turnout at public meeting in south Dublin calling for end of ‘State-sponsored grave robbery’ Former Fine Gael TD Alan Shatter says he hasn’t “given thought” to the prospect of running again for the Dáil as he urged people to campaign to abolish inheritance tax. Well in excess of 100 people, most appearing to be aged 50 or older, attended the inaugural meeting of Mr Shatter’s new campaign in Goatstown where he described inheritance tax as “State-sponsored grave robbery” and an “indefensible” interference in families. The question of reforming inheritance tax has come into sharp focus in recent months with the Taoiseach. Simon Harris, saying in July changes to inheritance tax deserved “to be considered” in next month’s budget. Children can inherit €335,000 from parents before they have to pay tax on any amount above that at 33 per cent. Previously, up to 2008, children could inherit €542,544 before being liable for tax at 20 per cent on amounts above that. “If the €542,000 was to reflect where it should be based in today’s values the exemption limit should be closer to €700,000,” Mr Shatter told his audience. During the meeting he described the tax as a “resentment tax” favoured by people who were “jealous” of those who had “lawfully accumulated assets”. He said it “was an “invention of the 1970s ... a sort of socialist dogma that there was something wrong that families should ... provide some financial assistance to other members of their family”. Mr Shatter, who held a seat in the constituency – formerly known as Dublin South – until 2016, said he did not expect his “former political colleagues” to abolish the tax in next month Budget. “I am expecting this campaign group, starting with your support, this campaign will run for some time, but the objective of abolishing inheritance tax is realistic.” Several people spoke from the floor, saying they agreed fully with Mr Shatter and told the difficulties they faced due to the tax. One woman said, to applause, that the Government appeared intent on “taking every single penny of the hard work of my parents, to give to people who may not have worked because they couldn’t be arsed”. Her parents “didn’t go on a foreign holiday until they were in their 50s. [The Government] can go and f**k off,” she said. A woman with a son with additional needs, living in her parents’ home, said she feared becoming homeless when they died. One man asked whether Mr Shatter had considered how the Government would replace the “revenue forgone” if inheritance tax was abolished – a question greeted with some muttering and shaking heads. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Shatter said he had started the campaign because people were “really badly affected by it ... and my former colleagues had absolutely no interest in it”. Asked if he would stand in the general election he said: “I genuinely haven’t given thought to that. The reaction of people this evening was very interesting and there is a life outside politics. “I didn’t know this evening would we have only ten people turning up ... I am honestly gobsmacked [by the turnout] and obviously delighted they did. “We may consider [holding meetings around the country]. We will maintain a profile for the issue, see what happens with the budget and then see where we are after that.”",0,1
2024/9/17,"Michael McGrath announced as EU commissioner for justice  Ursula von der Leyen says former Irish finance minister had ‘excellent track record’, as she announced the allocation of EU commissioner portfolios Former minister for finance Michael McGrath has been announced as the European Union’s (EU) next commissioner for justice and the rule of law. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen revealed the portfolios she handed out to her team of commissioners, who are put forward by each EU country, on Tuesday. The Government had been briefed beforehand that Mr McGrath was to be handed the commissioner role covering justice. The commissioner for justice is responsible for leading the EU’s efforts to tackle breaches of the rule of law by member states, such as Hungary and previously Poland under its populist former government. The commissioner is also responsible for enforcing legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as anti-corruption efforts. The role is currently held by Didier Reynders, a Belgian politician. Mr McGrath had been linked with the justice role in the last week, as Dr von der Leyen was finalising the various portfolios she planned to hand to each commissioner. The Government had always stated it would push for Mr McGrath to be given a finance-related commission portfolio. Ireland’s current EU commissioner, Mairead McGuinness, holds the role responsible for financial services, so the justice job would represent a sideways move. Speaking at a press conference, Dr von der Leyen said there was serious competition among EU countries for finance roles in the next commission. “Around 20 member states wanted a strong economic portfolio, we do not have 20 strong economic portfolios,” she said. Mr McGrath had an “excellent track record” and was an experienced national minister, Dr von der Leyen said. “The commissioners are not the technical experts, they are the political leaders,” she said. The justice brief was a “highly important portfolio”, that would include consumer rights and upholding the rule of law, she said. Dr von der Leyen spoke with Taoiseach Simon Harris on the phone on Monday evening, as part of a series of calls placed to national capitals. A number of factors had been working against Ireland securing a prominent finance-related portfolio. The Government ignored a request from Dr von der Leyen for countries to propose two names, with at least one being a woman, so she could build a gender-balanced team of commissioners. Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs also voted against Dr von der Leyen in a European Parliament vote that confirmed her reappointment as president of the EU’s executive arm for another five years. Mr McGrath stepped down as minister for finance in late June after the Cabinet agreed to nominate him as Ireland’s pick for its next EU commissioner. Reacting to the announcement, Mr Harris said the justice job was a “strong and influential appointment”. Tánaiste Micheál Martin said he had “no doubt” Mr McGrath would serve with “great energy and diligence in this significant role”. Dr von der Leyen detailed the portfolios she allocated to each commissioner on Tuesday morning, after she briefed the leaders of the eight political groupings in the European Parliament, during a meeting in Strasbourg. Eleven of the 27 team of commissioners, including Dr von der Leyen, are women, making up 40 per cent of the team. The German politician said initially it seemed as though only a fifth of potential nominees would be women, which she said was “completely unacceptable”. The commission president said she was involved in “intensive weeks of negotiations” with national capitals, to try to improve the number of women put forward as commissioners. Stéphane Séjourné, who dramatically replaced Thierry Breton as France’s nominee on Monday, was allocated a senior position overseeing industrial strategy. Teresa Ribera, the Spanish nominee, was given a senior role overseeing the climate transition, along with the powerful competition enforcement job. Raffaele Fitto, who comes from Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni’s hard right government, was handed a senior position covering regional development policy. Maroš Šefčovič, the long-time Slovakian commissioner, was given the trade portfolio, as well as a second role covering economic security. As commission president Dr von der Leyen counts as Germany’s commissioner, while Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas was already appointed as the EU’s next foreign affairs chief, as that role is decided by the 27 national leaders. Poland’s nominee Piotr Serafin secured the role overseeing the EU budget, while Dan Jørgensen, from Denmark, is to be the commissioner for energy and housing. The commissioner for financial services job currently held by Ms McGuinness is to pass to Maria Luís Albuquerque from Portugal. All the commissioners must now be approved by MEPs in European Parliament hearings in the coming weeks, before they take up their positions.",0,1
2024/9/17,"What does the EU commissioner for justice do? Role will include chastising EU countries over rule of law breaches and tackling foreign interference Michael McGrath has spent the last week reading up on what would be expected of him if European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen asked him to take on the EU portfolio covering justice. An accountant by trade, over his 20 years in politics the Cork man has been exclusively associated with finance. He was Fianna Fáil’s spokesman on the brief for many years in opposition, before becoming minister for public expenditure in 2020 and then later minister for finance. The plan when he stepped down after being nominated by the Government as Ireland’s next EU commissioner, was that he would secure a finance-related portfolio. In the carve up of the jobs at the top of the EU’s executive arm under Dr von der Leyen, Mr McGrath was named as the commissioner for democracy, justice and the rule of law. The portfolio is best known at present for leading the EU’s effort to chastise member states who breach or undermine the rule of law. In the last five years that meant clashes with Hungary’s rightwing prime minister Viktor Orban and Poland’s former Law and Justice government. Each year the commission produces a report tracking the progress and backsliding of EU countries on the rule of law. As commissioner Mr McGrath will be expected to keep the pressure on Hungary, and others like Slovakia, whose populist government has begun to follow the path set by Mr Orban. Changes here could include tying more strings to EU funds. The justice job also covers consumer rights, which will include work on a new EU law to better regulate social media influencers. He will also be in charge of legislation like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and anti-corruption efforts. The role is currently held by Didier Reynders, a former deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister in Belgium. A review of his commission diary for the last year shows he met representatives from several tech multinationals, such as Meta and Google, to discuss data protection laws. Due to the large concentration of big tech multinationals in Ireland, the country has traditionally been kept away from portfolios that cross into that field, like competition. Some aspects of Mr McGrath’s new job will bring him into contact, and potentially conflict, with tech giants. Dr von der Leyen said he would be responsible for taking forward the idea for a “European democracy shield”, to counter foreign interference. This might see Mr McGrath run up against social media giants over their platforms being used by foreign agents to interfere in elections and spread disinformation. Before he gets behind his desk as the new commissioner Mr McGrath will first have to pass a hearing in the European Parliament, which is to take place in the coming weeks.",0,1
2024/9/17,"Páirc Uí Chaoimh mooted as alternative Euro 2028 venue to Casement Park Croke Park also in the mix as Minister says it is important to ‘fight tooth and nail’ to keep as many games as possible on island Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork has been mooted as an alternative location for the Euro 2028 games that were slated for Casement Park in the wake of the British government’s confirmation that it will not fund the redevelopment of the stadium in Belfast in time for the tournament. Minister of State for sport Thomas Byrne has made the suggestion to the Football Association of Ireland, saying: “I think it’s important that we really fight tooth and nail to keep as many games as possible on the island and to encourage the FAI in that.” He made the remarks at a press conference at the end of Fianna Fáil’s pre-Dáil think-in meeting in Dublin. It came after Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin revealed that Páirc Uí Chaoimh in his home city has been put forward as a possible replacement for Casement Park. Last week the British government confirmed it would not fund the redevelopment of Casement Park for the tournament due to “a significant risk that it would not be built in time”. The derelict West Belfast GAA ground had been earmarked to host five matches at Euro 2028, being jointly hosted by the UK and Ireland. Estimates for the cost of redeveloping the stadium have risen from £180 million (€213 million) to £400 million. Mr Martin said there needs to be further engagement with the British government in relation to building a GAA stadium at the Casement site. He said an Irish Government offer to part-fund the project to the tune of €50 million “stays on the table”. He also said the prospect of Páirc Uí Chaoimh being used for Euro 2028 has been raised with the FAI. Mr Martin said: “It could be very challenging but nonetheless, I think we need as a country to push the boat out now in terms of improving our stadiums and hosting more and more of these competitions or elements of these competitions.” Mr Byrne said he raised the use of Páirc Uí Chaoimh during a discussion with interim FAI chief executive David Courell on Monday. “We want to keep as many games on the island as possible. Croke Park has always been in the mix. Uefa decided not to have it. “Páirc Uí Chaoimh would need work, as would Croke Park, to host the games up to the Uefa standard. “So we certainly put them into the mix.” He added: “I’m conscious that there are obviously other football associations apart from the FAI involved in this, and these discussions are ongoing.” Mr Byrne said any issues with Croke Park or Páirc Uí Chaoimh are “not insurmountable”. Mr Martin said he has had discussions with the GAA and it is interested in the Páirc Uí Chaoimh idea.",0,1
2024/9/17,"Michael McGrath’s new EU justice job is a win, but not the one Government wanted Ireland continues to labour under misplaced belief that it punches above its weight in Europe Ireland securing the European Union commissioner portfolio covering justice is a win, just maybe not the result the Government was hoping for. When each EU country told European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen what type of job they wanted for commissioner nominees they were putting forward, more than half had their eyes on some kind of economic or financial portfolio. With competition being intense for a handful of jobs, when it came down to it von der Leyen owed Ireland no favours. Former finance minister Michael McGrath was named as the next EU commissioner for democracy, justice and the rule of law. The role will see the Fianna Fáil politician pull up member states such as Hungary who are breaching the rule of law, as well as overseeing data protection regulations, and a new plan to tackle online interference by foreign powers. Justice is seen as a decent middle of the road portfolio that carries some heft. If he can forge a good working relationship with the commission president, McGrath could use the role to become an influential figure around the table in Brussels. Von der Leyen and her small group of advisers have been carefully planning the delicate balancing act of deciding what jobs to hand out to each country’s nominee for weeks. McGrath came into the frame for the justice job more than a week ago, according to several sources. It is believed Renew, the European political grouping Fianna Fáil belong to, wanted one of “their” commissioners in the job, which accounts for a large part of the reason behind Ireland ending up with justice. When soundings were first taken from the Government, the reaction afterwards in some quarters was unsure. There appeared to be some trepidation about settling for a role that wasn’t finance-related. Justice was not an area that was in McGrath’s traditional wheelhouse. As a country with a strong economy, the decision to send a sitting finance minister should have put Ireland in with a good chance of pushing for a position in that area. However, unlike some capitals, Dublin had no leverage over von der Leyen. The Government had ignored her request for countries to propose two names, with at least one being a woman, so she could build a gender-balanced team of commissioners. Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs had been vocal in their opposition to a second von der Leyen commission, voting against her in a European Parliament confirmation vote back in July. One mark in his favour was that McGrath came across as competent and solid in his sit-down interview with von der Leyen late last month. What EU portfolio a country bags every five years can be a game of snakes and ladders and one that Ireland is not considered to play very well. Finland, a country with a similar size population to Ireland’s, was rewarded this week by staying on von der Leyen’s good side. Finland was one of the other countries that nominated its commissioner pick early. But unlike Ireland, the Finnish government went with a woman candidate – Henna Virkkunen, a former minister and current MEP – as their choice. Virkkunen was made an “executive vice president” responsible for digital and tech policy, one of six more senior positions in the next commission, where she will sit above McGrath. At one point there was concern Ireland could find itself left with a commissioner job a lot closer to the bottom end of the table. The fact the commissioner for justice role was received with some initial disappointment, rather than being seen as a political lifebuoy, suggests the Government is still clinging to an outdated or perhaps misplaced belief Ireland can punch above its weight in Europe.",0,1
2024/9/18,"Leinster House barricades, road closures, restricted-access as Dáil starts new term Gardaí prevented cars and pedestrians from coming within 100m of the gates of Leinster House unless they had appropriate accreditation A ring of barricades encircled Leinster House and Government Buildings early this morning ahead of the first day of the new Dáil term. The barricades of various shapes and sizes were manned by dozens of gardaí who prevented cars and pedestrians from coming within 100m of the gates of Leinster House unless they had appropriate accreditation – which was being rigorously checked. All four roads leading to Kildare St from St Stephen’s Green, Molesworth St, Nassau St and Setanta Place were blocked off as was the junction of Baggot St and Merrion St and all the other approaches from Merrion Square. The zero-access rules were being applied across the board, even to 15-year-old girls in convent school uniforms trying to access classes close to St Stephen’s Green – who seemed unlikely candidates for any attempt at a violent overthrow of the Government. Business owners and employees in the buildings close to the corridors of power also had their access restricted. One person standing outside an office on Merrion Square laughed off the inconvenience while expressing a degree of annoyance that he had been expected to provide a letter from his employer proving who he was before he could get to work. “It was like being asked to get a letter from my mammy allowing me to go to work,” he said. When a passerby asked him what was going on, he responded drily: “I think Simon Harris is playing a gig there today, and I heard that Michael Healy-Rae is the support act.” A Garda spokeswoman said it was policy not to comment on ongoing operations, but she said the road closures “are expected to stay in place until tonight”. While the roads in the vicinity of Lenister St were as quiet as a Sunday morning, it was a different story elsewhere in the city with the widespread diversions causing massive tailbacks and congestion with traffic jams along Baggot St, Fitzwilliam St and as far as the north and south quays.",0,1
2024/9/18,"Damien English is latest Fine Gael TD to drop out of election race Seventeen of the 35 Fine Gael TDs who won seats in 2020 have now confirmed they will not run in the general election Former minister of State Damien English has decided not to run in the upcoming general election. It means that 17 of the 35 Fine Gael TDs who won seats in 2020 have confirmed they will not run in the election that many in political circles have speculated could happen as early as November. Mr English’s decision emerged on Wednesday evening as Fine Gael held its selection convention for the Meath West constituency. Meath councillor Linda Nelson Murray was selected as Mr English’s successor on the Fine Gael ticket at the convention in Navan. Mr English resigned from his role as a junior minister at the Department of Enterprise last year after it was revealed he gave incorrect information to a local authority when making a planning application. He spoke of the controversy later in 2023 in an interview with RTÉ radio saying he was “extremely disappointed” with himself and “embarrassed that standards I set for myself were not met and that is why I resigned”. At the time, in June last year, he said he hoped to run in the next general election. “Naturally, the people of Meath West will have to make a decision on that. I’ll certainly, like anybody else, be putting myself forward. I hope that people can look beyond this,” he said. Mr English resigned following a report on The Ditch website outlining how he did not declare his ownership of a house at Castlemartin, Co Meath when he made a planning application in 2008 to built a new one-off rural home nearby. The website also suggested Mr English should have declared the property in his returns to the Dáil’s Register of Members’ Interests for more than a decade. Mr English insisted he did not have to do this as the property was for “family use”. It was reported last year that the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) decided it would not investigate Mr English after concluding he had complied with the Ethics in Public Office Act in his annual declarations. Mr English is the latest in a series of Fine Gael politicians to announce their impending departure in recent months including former taoiseach Leo Varadkar and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.",0,1
2024/9/18,"Pension tax relief rises to cover pots of up to €2.8m by 2029 under Cabinet plans Limit had caused problems for filling senior Garda and civil service roles Retirees will be able to get tax relief on up to €2.8 million in a pension pot under plans approved by Cabinet on Wednesday. Ministers signed off on a proposal from Minister for Finance Jack Chambers to gradually increase the figure – which currently is limited to €2 million – by €200,000 a year until 2029, starting in 2026 and culminating in 2029. The limit had been pointed to as a barrier to the filling of senior positions within the Garda, as well as a potential stumbling block for other high earning public servants. Once a pension pot hits €2 million under current rules it is subject to Chargeable Excess Tax (CET) of 40 per cent for anything over that level. A review of the standard fund threshold (SFT), as it is known, was announced last December by then Minister for Finance Michael McGrath with independent expert Dr Donal de Buitléir appointed to carry it out. Mr Chambers confirmed that the Government decided on Wednesday to implement the review’s recommendation that the SFT be increased on a phased basis to €2.8 million. He said the Government decided to maintain the CET rate at 40 per cent – not reduce it to 10 per cent as recommended by the de Buitléir report – but that this will be reviewed by 2030. Mr Chambers also said he intends to use the upcoming Finance Bill to provide for the threshold for the higher rate of taxation to apply to a pension lump sum be set at €500,000 rather than a proportion of the SFT. This means that this threshold will not increase as the level of the SFT rises. The value of the pensions of several hundred senior Civil Service personnel at principal officer or above is now at or above €2 million each, according to submissions to the review group. Last year it emerged that concern over tax implications on retirement was dissuading gardaí from seeking promotion to the role of Deputy Garda Commissioner. Public service pension schemes, particularly those in place before 2013, generally provide for 50 per cent of salary and a lump sum of 1.5 times salary based on full service. Groups such as doctors argue that current salary levels could see them hit the SFT limit years before normal retirement age – which could encourage some to depart in advance of schedule. Submissions to the review maintain that funds above the threshold level are subject to a chargeable excess tax of 40 per cent effective rate. The employers’ group Ibec said if USC and PRSI was included, this resulted in an effective rate on income above the SFT of up to 72 per cent. During a press conference at Government Buildings it was put to Mr Chambers that the planned increase of the SFT to €2.8 million amounted to giving well-off people more money. Mr Chambers countered this to say the plans are a “retention measure for those who want to stay or be promoted within their workplace” and that is an “important principle”. He also pointed to the decision not to reduce the CET rate. He said: “this is a balanced approach and will help to address the well-documented issues which were there in the context of certain positions in the public service, for example.” Mr Chambers also said he thinks the planned change “will make a difference in filling important roles, particularly when it comes to An Garda Síochána.”",0,1
2024/9/18,"Free contraception for 16-year-olds amounts to State giving licence for underage sex, says Aontú's Tóibín  Donnelly is seeking an expansion to the scheme providing free contraception to women – including possibly to 16-year-olds Providing free contraception to 16-year-olds would amount to the State “giving licence to underage sexual activity”, according to Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín. His remarks comes after it emerged Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is seeking an expansion to the scheme providing free contraception to women – including possibly to 16-year-olds – as part of the upcoming budget. The current scheme covers women aged between 17 and 35. Extending the upper age limit, perhaps by as much as five years, is straightforward. The possibility of including 16-year-olds in the scheme is being looked at, although it is said to be “legally complex” and raises ethical questions as the age of consent for sexual activity in Ireland is 17. There is understood to be some resistance within the Department of Health to the proposal. Meath West TD Mr Tóibín criticised the proposal saying “sexual activity for children is dangerous” and “engaging in risky sexual behaviours can lead to HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases, and unintended pregnancy among children. “There is also significant emotional and mental health consequences to sexual activity among minors.” “Children are incredibly susceptible to peer pressure. This peer pressure may well increase for a child, if the State, in a practical sense, is giving licence to underage sexual activity.” A spokesman for Mr Donnelly declined to respond to the criticism but pointed to remarks made by the Minister earlier on Tuesday that outlined his position. Mr Donnelly said the free contraception scheme has gone “very well” with more than half of 17- to 25-year-olds availing of it. He said access to 16-year-olds is “more complex and it’s something we’ve been discussing in the Department of Health for quite some time”. He said “some very legitimate concerns have been raised with me, some around legal complexities, some around the age of consent being 17 ... and various principles that are used in medical ethics so there has been an ongoing discussion”. Mr Donnelly added he has “a pretty simple view on this”, which is the age for consent for medical treatment is 16. “A young woman in Ireland today can go into her GP and say she’s pregnant and she wants to avail of termination-of-pregnancy services and they will be provided to her quite rightly. “I feel that if we are offering those services to a young woman who is 16 years of age she should also be able to go into her GP and say I’d like to be able to avail of free contraception. So it’s no more complex than that really.” Mr Donnelly said there was “no resistance” to the idea within in Fianna Fáil and that there has been a lot of support in the party for women’s health initiatives. Asked if the Government should be looking at changes to the age of consent for sexual activity he said: “That’s a broader question, not one for me for this morning.” Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik welcomed the proposal, saying: “Any development that is positive for the health of our young people, the health of young women, that’s very, very positive indeed.” She said she did not accept Mr Tóibín’s argument it would amount to the State giving licence to underage sex. “If a young person can consent to medical intervention at 16 that should include the pill because as I say the pill is used for a whole multitude of reasons,” Ms Bacik said. “It is often prescribed particularly in younger people for menstrual regulation. “I don’t accept the argument that says that it’s necessarily inextricably linked to the age of consent [for sexual activity]. I think that’s a separate matter.”",0,1
2024/9/18,"Michael McGrath given mid-ranking EU commissioner for justice job European Commission justice portfolio viewed as mid-ranking role by current and former officials Ireland’s next European Union commissioner, Michael McGrath, has been handed the portfolio covering justice and the rule of law, a position regarded as a mid-ranking role by several current and former senior EU officials. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced the jobs she had picked for her team of commissioners, who had been nominated by each country to lead the EU’s powerful executive arm for the next five years. While large countries such as France, Italy, Spain and Poland secured some of the most important portfolios, Ireland was given a middle-of-the-table job responsible for justice and upholding the rule of law in Europe. Mr McGrath, who stepped down as finance minister in June after he was nominated by the Government to be Ireland’s next EU commissioner, had been pushing for a prominent economic role in Dr von der Leyen’s new commission. The justice role will probably see Mr McGrath clash with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban over efforts by his populist right-wing government to further undermine human rights and the rule of law. Speaking on Tuesday, Mr McGrath said the EU could not allow backsliding on this front to spread. “I think it is reasonable to expect all member states to abide by a common set of rules, particularly if you want to enjoy the benefits of European Union membership, significant financial benefits in many cases,” he said. In the horse trading over the commissioner jobs, it is understood Renew, the centrist grouping Fianna Fáil belongs to in Europe, had sought the justice job for a nominee from its ranks, which in part led Dr von der Leyen to pick Mr McGrath for the portfolio. The Government was privately briefed that Mr McGrath was being lined up for the commissioner for justice job more than a week ago. There was “no sense” that Fianna Fáil MEPs decision to vote against Dr von der Leyen’s reappointment as commission president was still being held against Ireland, Mr McGrath said. “I think everyone has moved on,” he said. Mr McGrath will now need to pass a confirmation hearing in the European Parliament in the coming weeks, before he formally takes up his role as commissioner.",0,1
2024/9/19,"Housing and transport for regional cities needed to counterbalance Dublin overdevelopment, says Ryan State will ‘tip over’ to the east coast if building overly concentrated in capital city, according to Minister  Political parties need to set out how they will prioritise and fund transport linked to housing in regional cities in election manifestos to counterbalance overdevelopment in Dublin, Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan has said. If construction was overly concentrated on Dublin, “the country will tip over to the east coast”, he told the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Climate Action on Thursday. The updated national planning framework due to be published shortly would align housing and transport more closely, he added. Scale-up in transport was already happening by building housing close to railway stations, especially on the east coast, and complemented by investment in Dart, metro and Luas services. Waterford was becoming a model example in transport-led development, while there was similar progress in Cork and Limerick. Prioritising transport would tackle the housing and climate crises “but all this requires considerable political commitment”, said the Minister. Committee chairman Brian Leddin TD (Green Party) welcomed indications transport emissions had peaked in Ireland and overall emissions were decoupled from economic growth, but warned “decoupling emissions from population growth is going to be a huge challenge”. The focus had to be on where people were going to live, he said. Enhanced regional cities with the right density of housing and rapid rail services would ensure transport emissions would not rebound, he added. While there was spectacular growth in public transport use, “we have to throw everything at transport” because of a car-dependent system, said Mr Ryan. Responding to Darren O’Rourke TD (Sinn Féin), he denied there were bottlenecks in the roll-out of renewable energy projects. If the first tranche of six offshore wind farms cleared planning and legal hurdles in a timely way, he was confident the Government’s five-gigawatt target by 2030 would be met. A target of 195,000 EVs on Irish roads by 2025 would be achieved while charging infrastructure was ramping up. Lack of resourcing of An Bord Pleanála had been addressed, said Mr Ryan, though issues at local authority level needed to be looked at as some “effectively ruled themselves out of the renewable energy revolution” because of their development plans. Asked by People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy if he was concerned about Ireland’s vulnerability from escalating data centre electricity demand that was likely to be compounded by artificial intelligence requirements, Mr Ryan replied: “We all have to make sure we live with climate limits ... I believe data centres can live within those limits and can bring real benefits to the country.” Use of gas-fired power generation was not appropriate, however, and he had given clear direction to Gas Networks Ireland this was not the way to go.",0,1

Dr Mahony and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly have released a new report which examines the rising cost to the taxpayer of medical negligence cases taken against the State. Speaking at the launch of the report on Thursday, Dr Mahony said the current liability to the State from such claims stands at around €5 billion. She said  the current system is unnecessarily adversarial, while financial costs are rising at an average rate of 13 per cent a year. According to her report, the current estimated outstanding liability of almost €5 billion “could rise by multiples over the next two decades if unchecked”. “Over half the total annual costs of healthcare litigation in Ireland are associated with claims for catastrophic injuries that account for only 2 per cent of claims annually. It is the rising cost of damages paid in these cases to provide for care for affected individuals that is the standout driver of rising costs,” the report says. It includes a research study of 15 patients and families who have litigated. They talked of “a very negative experience of seeking justice through the civil litigation system in Ireland”. “They variously described it as triggering, re-traumatising, jarring, insulting, shocking, horrible, not fit for purpose, and a battle. Several participants identified the system as particularly unsuited to those who have already experienced a significant trauma.” The report states that the rising cost of clinical claims is predominantly driven by the rising costs of individual claims rather than by increasing numbers of new claims. Mass action claims accounted for 8 per cent of all new claims in recent years, and 10 per cent of the total costs. The estimated outstanding liability for healthcare claims in Ireland has risen by 64 per cent between 2018 and 2022, or from €2.8 billion to €4.6 billion, representing an average rise of approximately 13 per cent per year. The report says  it is “impossible to address strategies to minimise harm if shortages of staff and resources combine to create potential risk for the very harm the system is trying to reduce”. While her group acknowledged progress made in the increased recruitment of clinical staff in recent years, it warned that “serious problems still exist in relation to recruitment and retention of frontline clinical staff”. Dr Mahony’s report recommends that every healthcare setting providing clinical care should have the capability to undertake a “swift and comprehensive analysis of, and response to, serious adverse events that occur within its own setting”. The report also recommends that guidelines and training for meaningful debriefing with the patient and family following an adverse event should be put in place in each hospital. It also recommends that any necessary supports should be available immediately, within existing resource allocation, to assist parents with the additional care needs of children with catastrophic birth injuries. Dr Mahony’s working group also recommended the development of a vaccine damage scheme. Speaking at the report launch, Mr Donnelly said that money that can be saved “through keeping people safe is money we can invest in our hospitals, invest in our community care. The group, along with examining the financial costs, also placed a strong emphasis on the human cost of litigation. “We really want to find less difficult processes, and the report sets out a lot of recommendations and measures aimed at improving civil litigation, preventing clinical harm, obviously, which is the first priority, and then providing enhanced care for those who were affected by harm.”",0,1
2024/9/19,"Government asking ordinary workers to build ‘gold-plated’ pensions of elite, says Pearse Doherty Cabinet decision will give wealthiest workers tax-free pension pot of €2.8 million when average pot is only €111,000 The Government has been accused of asking ordinary workers to help build up the “gold-plated” pension pots of the elite following the controversial Government decision to allow retirees get tax relief on up to €2.8 million in their pension pots. Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty accused the Government of moving to “significantly benefit the wealthiest taxpayers”, adding that last year 254 people had a pension pot above €2 million and the average pension pot was only €111,000. “People could only dream of €2 million,” he said. On Wednesday the Cabinet agreed a proposal from Minister for Finance Jack Chambers to gradually increase the current €2 million tax-free limit by €200,000 a year from 2026 until it reaches €2.8 million in 2028. The move follows concerns last year that the €2 million limit before tax of 40 per cent is introduced was dissuading gardaí from applying for senior positions and also acted as a barrier for other high earning public servants. But Mr Doherty described the tax change as “madness” and said the Government is asking “those who work in Tesco’s or nurses or guards or firefighters or teachers to help build up the pension funds of those at the very top, to the tune of €2.8 million”. He said they could retire with the State-supported pension of €100,000 a year with a “massive tax break of €320,000″. He added: “It is crazy.” These are people with pension pots already of €2 million and an annual pension entitlement of over €70,000. “Meanwhile those on the State pension languish and are left with crumbs off the table. And this is the wrong choice that the Government is making at any time but definitely the wrong choice when we’re dealing with a crisis in terms of cost of living and workers and families are struggling.” He claimed the Minister for Finance could not tell the Budget Oversight Committee how much this measure would cost, “but we do know that it is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of euro”. The Donegal TD said the Government could not defend this as he asked Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien “why should we be asking the workers of Tesco or the hairdressers or the workers on the shop floor to actually help contribute to a pension pot of €2.8 million for the most wealthy in Irish society”. Mr O’Brien, standing in for Tánaiste Micheál Martin on leaders’ questions said the decision arose from an independent report – by Dr Donal de Buitléar - and “in a very phased way from 2026 to increase the standard funding threshold”. He added that since the Government came into office, the State pension had increased by €29 a week “and we’re focusing very, very closely in our budget negotiations of ensuring that those on the State pension receive the increases that they deserve”. They had also done very significant work on non-contributory pensions and had introduced pension auto-enrolment. Mr O’Brien said Sinn Féin had proposed to reduce pension tax relief year on year to the standard rate, “which would take the legs from under your average nurse”. But Mr Doherty said this was a “complete mistruth”. He said the move will entitle them to a State-supported pension of €100,000 and a tax cut of €320,000. He said ordinary people “don’t have a whiff of pensions of €70,000, €80,000, €90,000.” The Minister said the Government have been reforming pension arrangements and auto enrolment would change the situation where only 50 per cent of people have made pension provision themselves.",0,1
2024/9/19,"Taoiseach’s stance on general election timing ‘has not changed’ despite Fine Gael’s strong showing in poll Simon Harris said he is ‘grateful’ to public for ‘giving me a chance’ Taoiseach Simon Harris’s stance on the timing of a general election “has not changed” amid an increase in support for his party and a surge in his personal approval rating. The Fine Gael leader on Thursday played down the significance of the latest Irish Times/Ipsos opinion poll, which placed his party at 27 per cent of the vote (up four since early summer), ahead of Sinn Féin on 20 per cent (down three) and Fianna Fáil on 19 per cent (down one). The result is Fine Gael’s highest since June 2021, and the lowest for Sinn Féin since the 2020 general election The Taoiseach’s personal approval rating  rose to 55 per cent (up by 17 per cent since the last poll in early summer). Speaking to reporters at the National Ploughing Championships on Thursday, Mr Harris said he is “very grateful to the people of Ireland for giving me a chance”. “Polls come and polls go. I am a new Taoiseach, but I am in politics long enough to not read too much into them,” he said. However, he acknowledged it is “better to be up than down”. There will be a general election in “due course”, he said, adding that his position on its timing “has not changed”. “Right now I want the Government to get on with its work and I want the Government to finish its work as well,” he said. He and the other Coalition party leaders have repeatedly insisted they intend to wait until next February or March to hold the election. However, there is a widespread belief across political circles that a November election is likely. Asked about his reaction to the polling, Tánaiste Micheál Martin, whose party, Fianna Fáil, dropped by one per cent, said: “We will do all we can to outpoll the polls.” “It is all there to play for and we are going to work very hard at constituency and at national level,” he said, adding that the “dynamic” of the campaign will be crucial. Also speaking from the agricultural event in Ratheniska, Co Laois, the Tánaiste said his feelings about polls are well known. “In the May poll and in all the polling before the local elections we were a distant third and we came out first in terms of seats in the local elections. We doubled our European seats from two to four only last June,” he added. The Fianna Fáil leader said he loves campaigning, but “in the meantime we have to govern and we have to get a budget through”. He would not be drawn when asked about potential dates for the election. The Irish Times/Ipsos headline opinion poll results excludes undecided voters (20 per cent of respondents) and those unlikely to vote. Among the smaller parties the Green Party is at 5 per cent (up one); Labour 6 per cent (up one); the Social Democrats 4 per cent (up one); Solidarity-People Before Profit 2 per cent (no change); Aontú 1 per cent (no change). Independents are at 16 per cent (down one). Voters were asked which party, if any, they would vote for in an immediate general election.",0,1
2024/9/19,"€335,000 Leinster House bike shelter was delayed due to concerns over removal of parking spaces for politicians Contractors were also concerned about disrupting Dáil with noise of machinery The construction of the €335,000 bike shelter at Leinster House was hit by delays due to concerns over the removal of car parking spaces for TDs and Senators as well as challenges over not disrupting the Dáil. Internal records from the Oireachtas, released following a freedom of information request, show the completion date for the project slipped repeatedly. Strict conditions were put in place for the project to ensure “full dust containment” and to avoid any debris ending up in easily blocked historic drains. The records go some way to explain why the project proved so costly, with Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Feargháil telling the Dáil this week the final €336,051 bill was a “profound embarrassment”. A meeting between the OPW and the Oireachtas last September was told the foundations for the project were to be laid in the coming weeks but that “effectively work can now only proceed during non-sitting periods”. Notes of the meeting said: “A completion date will be around the 14th [of] January whereby the car parking spaces [for TDs and Senators] will be returned for use.” By the following month, the project still appeared to be on track with “fabrication in process” and the “handover” date still set for mid-January. However, by the time January came, the project had been delayed with minutes of a meeting saying the new completion date was now the second week of March. By February, progress was delayed again – this time until the end of March. The documents detail how the Oireachtas was worried about the temporary loss of parking spaces for politicians. One email between officials last September said: “[We have been asked] to ensure that the hoarding around the proposed bicycle parking is removed before the sittings resume. We have lost approximately ten parking spaces due to the hoarding, and that loss is not tenable once members return.” Another email from last September explained how the original plans for the shelter had included the provision of EV charging points for bicycles. However, that was dropped due to what was seen as a “significant fire risk”. At the end of February, a difficulty arose in moving the frame for the shelter. “We didn’t take into consideration the space required for lifting the structure of the bike shelter,” said a message from the contractor. Asked about the records, an Oireachtas spokeswoman said: “The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission had no role in relation to the approval of capital expenditure for the bicycle shelter in Leinster House. The cost was not paid from the Commission’s budget.” She said that a plan for the provision of a bicycle shelter had been brought before the Oireachtas Commission in June 2021 and was approved. Meanwhile, a meeting of the Dáil’s spending watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) wants to bring the OPW before it on October 10th to quiz its officials on the bikeshed project. The OPW is also due to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure next week. A Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) report which will include information on the bikeshed is expected to be published in the interim. At its meeting on Thursday, PAC chairman Brian Stanley outlined how the committee is seeking an OPW briefing on the cost and work associated with the project including all documentation related to contracts for design, planning and construction; a timeline from “concept to delivery” and a schedule of decision-makers and managers working on the project. Fianna Fáil PAC member Paul McAuliffe told the meeting that “rightly or wrongly the public believe that when works take place in this House... there is some political oversight of those works and of the costs associated with them.”",0,1
2024/9/2,"Housing fight for Sinn Féin will be convincing voters to ditch Government schemes Sinn Féin’s housing plan is nothing if not detailed, but voters may be cautious of untested solutions General election battle lines on housing are clearly being drawn, and the early skirmishes that followed Monday’s publication of Sinn Féin’s housing plan tell us a lot about the contest for credibility on this most intractable and thorny problem. The plan is nothing if not detailed, running to 107 pages – and Sinn Féin is going to press its message home quite literally, planning a nationwide mail out of an abridged version to every home in the country in the coming weeks. It aims for a regearing of the housing system, envisaging 30 per cent of homes being “non-market public housing”, as opposed to the current situation where the party says 84 per cent is “private for profit”. This will require the construction of an average of 60,000 new homes a year over the next five years, it says. The Government admits its official target of 33,000 a year is inadequate, and the indications are that new targets next month will be about 50,000 annually. It is noteworthy that the Sinn Féin plan lacks some of the more explicitly “retail” elements that the Government strategy boasts. The Coalition has invested both political and financial capital in schemes like Help to Buy and its shared equity First Home Scheme, probably the two best-known interventions out of Darragh O’Brien’s sprawling array of policies deployed since 2020. The attraction is clear for the Government – these programmes are turning renters into owners. The Sinn Féin riposte is they are limited to only some of the market, but inflate it for everyone. It plans to wind down or axe these schemes entirely, while tweaking eligibility criteria for others; Pearse Doherty said on Monday that another two years of Government policy would make houses €50,000 more expensive, a sobering proposition for anyone hoping to purchase a home. The party says that a host of reforms to the planning process, as well measures on zoning, supports for small builders and wider use of compulsory purchase orders would negate the need for schemes that work to drive demand. That sounds like an elegant solution, but deeper reforms take longer to achieve – and the Government will doubtlessly argue that much of this work is already under way. The fight for Sinn Féin will be to convince voters that ditching these schemes will not leave houses further out of reach in the short term, even if they can make a convincing case for a better-functioning housing market five years from now. There is evidence that the party is fine-tuning its offering to give more in the short term – the housing plan contains a stamp duty exemption for first-time buyers of homes up to €450,000, which was not featured in extensive trailing of its policies over the summer, and is understood only to have been agreed in recent weeks. It says from year one, there will be more affordable homes, pointing to 22,000 homes stuck in the bureaucratic system for delivering social homes. It is also offering a three-year rent freeze from day one. Another angle of attack the Government has already identified is the novelty of some of Sinn Féin’s proposals – take, for example, the affordable homes scheme which is predicated on the State owning the land under a property in perpetuity, with some restrictions on the future sale or rental of an owned property. It says it can produce affordable homes for between €250,000-€300,000 this way. The Coalition has dived on this policy, arguing that banks won’t write mortgages for it (the banks themselves are mute on the question so far, while Sinn Féin says they are confident this won’t be a problem). They also argue, somewhat hyperbolically, that it makes traditional home ownership impossible. Again, this is a battle that will play out in the minds of voters: is the Sinn Féin plan credible enough to convince voters to walk away from Government schemes they probably intuitively feel are flawed, but offer the chance of home ownership? Sinn Féin also says the party will spend less on long-term funds to pay for changing demographics, climate change and infrastructural shortfalls to invest in housing. Doherty, the party’s finance spokesman, was particularly strong on this point, and the politics of it are compelling: it is very easily understood, in an age of catchphrase politics, to diminish Government plans to spend tomorrow when there are so many problems in the here and now. But it opens up another front for the Government, which will doubtlessly question whether Sinn Féin can be trusted with the big economic decisions. The Government says it has turned a corner on housing – but affordability, supply shortfalls and homelessness are as dire as ever. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin says the entire map has to be redrawn, but its solutions are untested even if they come against a backdrop of lacklustre Government achievements. How this contest plays out among the pool of undecided voters will determine much in the months ahead.",0,1
2024/9/2,"Taoiseach’s letter asks if measures to reduce bulk-buying of houses have been ‘entirely successful’ A letter to Michael McGrath sought an increase in the 10% rate of stamp duty on bulk purchases of residential houses by investment companies Further action is required to reduce the percentage of houses being snapped up by private companies and then typically rented out to tenants, the Taoiseach Simon Harris has indicated. Mr Harris wrote to the then minister for finance in June seeking a possible increase in the 10 per cent rate of stamp duty on bulk purchases of residential houses by investment companies. In a letter to the outgoing minister, Michael McGrath, the Taoiseach queried if the higher stamp duty introduced in 2021 to discourage the bulk purchase of residential houses by institutional investors had been “entirely successful”. He wrote that “further action” was required to reduce the percentage of houses being bought by private companies. One of the other actions that might be pursued is lowering the number of houses that triggers the higher rate of stamp duty. At present, if an investor buys 10 houses or more during a 12-month period, they are liable to pay the 10 per cent stamp duty for each property purchased. Citing Revenue figures, Mr Harris said that since the new tax was introduced in May 2021 the number of bulk-purchased houses had increased in each succeeding year – from 187 in 2021 to 395 in 2022 and 623 in 2023. In the letter, which has been seen by The Irish Times, Mr Harris  argued bulk purchasing of houses needed for first-time buyers cannot be tolerated. The Taoiseach asked Mr McGrath to explore options including a possible increase to the rate of stamp duty and also a possible lowering of the minimum threshold of 10 properties (bought in a 12-month period) that makes the purchaser liable to the higher stamp duty. The standard stamp duty rates for residential properties are 1 per cent on the first €1 million paid and 2 per cent on the excess over €1 million. The higher levy applies only to houses and not to apartments. A new house worth €300,000 will attract stamp duty of €30,000 if bought as part of a bulk purchase, €27,000 more than if bought by a private buyer. A developer bulk purchasing houses worth €1 million will pay €100,000 on each property bought, compared with €10,000 for a private buyer. It is understood Department of Finance officials are currently preparing a detailed analysis of institutional investor activity over the last three years in the residential house market, including to see how many purchased fewer than 10 properties. The analysis will also include an options paper regarding possible changes to the stamp duty rate and threshold. That paper is expected to be discussed by the three coalition party leaders in Government during September, in advance of the budget on October 1st. Sinn Féin tabled a private members’ motion in the Dáil last January calling for the rate of stamp duty to be increased from 10 per cent to 17 per cent. It was on the back of several high-profile purchases of houses in a new estate by investors. In 2023, a single company purchased 46 of 54 houses in a development at Belcamp Manor in north Dublin. The four-bedroom homes were subsequently rented out on the private market. In a response to parliamentary questions from Sinn Féin earlier this year, Mr McGrath said that since the new rate was introduced, less than one in 100 of all residential property transitions attracted the higher stamp duty, and less that 2 per cent of all new dwellings. “I do not have immediate plans to increase the rate and reduce the threshold at which the higher stamp duty rate on certain purchases of residential property applies,” he told Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty. The decision on whether or not to vary the stamp duty and the minimum threshold of 10 for a bulk buy will fall to Mr McGrath’s successor as Minister for Finance, Jack Chambers. Any changes are likely to be announced as part of the Budget 2025 cycle.",0,1
2024/9/2,"Eamon Ryan ‘shocked’ at over-€335,000 cost of bike shed at Leinster House Minister says OPW has questions to answer over cost of structure that allows for storage of 18 bikes A new bicycle shed for Leinster House that cost more than €335,000 and allows for storage of 18 bikes is “too expensive”, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has said. Mr Ryan said the Office of Public Works (OPW) had questions to answer in relation to the cost and that he was “shocked” when he saw the price. “Perhaps they [the OPW] have a reason, but I wasn’t aware of it, and I think we have to show that we spend the public money wisely and that sort of cost seems to me, very high,” he told reporters on Monday. The cost of the bike shed was revealed in The Irish Times over the weekend. A breakdown of costs from the OPW showed €322,282 was spent on the main construction and installation project. A further €2,952 was spent on archaeological services while €10,816 was paid for quantity surveying services and “contract administration services”. The shelter required archaeological advice to make sure it fitted in at the parliamentary complex. The former Green Party leader said it was important to have bike sheds but that “we need to do things cheaper than that all over the country”. Mr Ryan also said if public transport infrastructure, such as bus shelters, was too expensive the State would not be able to deliver it. “I think this [the bike shed] could be a useful lesson to say ... how can we deliver good architecture, good street furniture, good kind of support the people want, but not make it so expensive,” he said. “Maybe, in some ways this case might make the case for us doing things cheaper and standardising so it won’t be as expensive.” Separately, Mr Ryan said a two-drink limit at airports would be “very difficult to police”. Last week, Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, called for alcohol limits to help tackle antisocial behaviour on flights. The Minister said although there was an issue with behaviour on flights and he could understand why Mr O’Leary would want that limit, he found it “hard to see how it would work”. “We do need people to behave ... safety in aviation is the first priority for other passengers,” he said. “But I’m not sure how practically it will work.” Mr Ryan said there were already strong sanctions for people who misbehaved on flights and the courts “do not look lightly on anyone who disrupts an airplane by their behaviour”. “I think that’s probably the better way of keeping things in check, rather than trying to police how many drinks people have in the airport,” he said. The Minister was speaking as a new campaign and funding programme for community climate engagement was unveiled in Baldoyle, north Dublin, this morning.",0,1
2024/9/20,"State needs to ‘learn lessons’ from escalation of anti-migrant protests in Coolock, Micheál Martin says Tanáiste was responding to new footage of protests broadcast by RTÉ on Thursday night Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said he was “uncomfortable” with what he saw on RTÉ Investigates last night with the State needing to “learn lessons” in relation to how anti-migrant protests in Coolock in Dublin last July escalated into rioting. For the past six months Journalist Barry O’Kelly of RTÉ Investigates has been filming at protests against accommodation for migrants. The programme captured the moment on July 15th when a security officer at the former Crown Paints site in Coolock was knocked unconscious when he was hit by a pole. It also showed the throwing of a petrol bomb and the abuse of construction workers by anti-immigrant protesters. Speaking in Cork, Micheál Martin paid tribute to the team at RTÉ Investigates, and in particular Barry O’Kelly, who he said put himself in “harm’s way” to shed a light on a ‘very dangerous trend” developing in Ireland. “People are taking the law in to their own hands, intimidating ordinary workers going about their daily jobs, intimidating, harassing and committing violent acts against migrants and against people more generally.” The Tánaiste condemned the appalling scenes filmed by RTÉ Investigates and said we need to examine what occurred to see what can be learned from it. “I think the State does need to learn lessons from what happened in Coolock. I watched it [RTÉ Investigates’ last evening. I was uncomfortable with what I saw. I know the gardaí have issued very strong statements accounting for what transpired over those few days. And overall about 200 gardaí were involved. “But this is a relatively new phenomenon in Ireland in terms of the degree to which people think they can take control of given environments – or indeed the degree to which they think they can take the law in to their own hands. “I think, yes, there are certainly lessons to be learned. And we do need to reflect on whether our criminal justice system needs review in terms of combating the type of behaviour we saw on RTÉ Investigates last evening.” Mr Martin wouldn’t be drawn on whether the garda response to the Coolock protests was inadequate as suggested by some people in the documentary. However, he admitted that the days of what we consider to be “a traditional garda response” were over. “There was period of time there when the workers in the facility had been ringing [Gardai] consistently. It looked very ominous. It looked very dangerous and threatening. The gardaí did get there. And I think we need to learn lessons from it. “When you look at what happened in the United Kingdom where there was a very rapid response to rioting recently where people were before the courts within days and some jailed within a week I think we could learn lessons from that. “I think the days of sort of what we might consider a traditional response are over. And I think we cannot accept people taking the law in to their own hands in the pre determined way,” he said. Mr Martin said that the people responsible for what occurred at Coolock were not getting away with what they did. “To be fair there have been quite a number of significant arrests arising out of that incident. A report was presented to the Policing Authority in respect of that and quite a number of people are still before the courts. So people are not getting away with what they did,” he said. Mr Martin also condemned the “intimidation” of RTÉ staff, particularly reporter Barry O’Kelly. “There can be no tolerance for any interference with the media. They should be allowed to go about their job unhindered and the threats and intimidation of Barry O’Kelly and camera people [as seen on the programme] yesterday evening is a threat to our democracy. Let us be very clear about that,” he said.",0,1
2024/9/20,"‘Significantly understaffed’: Hiqa to conduct review into midwest care capacity after Aoife Johnston report Donnelly says regulator will determine if second emergency department is needed following death at UHL The State’s healthcare regulator has been asked to conduct a review into urgent and emergency care capacity in the midwest, including to determine whether a second emergency department is needed, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said. Mr Donnelly was speaking following the publication of a report by former chief justice Frank Clarke into the death of 16-year-old Aoife Johnston. Ms Johnston died of meningitis on December 19th, 2022, at UHL, after she was left for more than 13 hours without “vital” antibiotics. Mr Clarke’s report found the hospital’s emergency department (ED) was “significantly understaffed” while overcrowding at the midwest hospital was “undoubtedly more severe than it should have been”. He also said that despite improvements since 2022, “a risk of reoccurrence will inevitably be present”. Mr Donnelly said that Hiqa, the State’s healthcare regulator, has been asked to conduct a review. “Hiqa has been asked to lead a review into urgent and emergency care capacity in the midwest region, including to determine whether a second emergency department is required. Implementation of Mr Clarke’s recommendations, as well as the actions and changes recommended by the HSE expert clinical review also published today, are important for the patients of the midwest, as well as the staff in UHL, to rebuild confidence in the safety and quality of the care and services provided there.” “My thoughts today are with Aoife’s family. I know that each day is difficult for them as they deal with the devastating loss of their beloved daughter and sister. Their grief has been compounded by the circumstances, and failings, that led to her untimely death.” “The report identifies a number of factors that contributed to delayed treatment and Aoife’s death, including unclear protocols, ad hoc systems, poor internal communication and a failure to deploy the escalation protocol,” Mr Donnelly said. Sinn Féin spokesperson on Health, David Cullinanedescribed the Clarke Report into the death of Aoife Johnston as “heartbreaking”. Mr Cullinane said the report and major population changes in the Midwest over the last decade show that there is a compelling case for a second Model 3 hospital with an emergency department in the Midwest, and that a major and urgent expansion in capacity across the Midwest is needed to end the crisis at UHL. “Mr Clarke draws a very clear link between the closure of emergency departments in Ennis and Nenagh, when Aoife was just a small child, and the perpetual crisis at University Hospital Limerick today,” Mr Cullinane said. “Fifteen years later, capacity at UHL is still below the recommended level before the closure of Ennis and Nenagh, and has not kept up in any way with population growth and demographic changes.” Labour’s spokesman for health Duncan Smith called for “immediate and decisive action.” “It is devastating to think that a young life has been lost due to avoidable shortcomings in our healthcare system. The report highlights the unacceptable staffing levels at the Emergency Department in UHL, and this is something that cannot be ignored. It is simply unconscionable that we continue to have a situation where lives are at risk due to inadequate staffing.” “Minister Donnelly needs to urgently address this crisis.” The Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA) said the report provides “troubling and telling independent analysis.” “Transparency, collaboration, and swift action are essential to restoring trust in and within UHL. While some measures are being introduced, more urgent and informed actions are needed.” The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said the organisation’s members have “long expressed deep and have felt frustrations arising from the failure of the entire system to respond effectively, or at all, when clinical concerns were raised.” “Overcrowding in University Hospital Limerick has been out of control for far too long.”",0,1
2024/9/20,"Irish Times poll results show a strained electorate sensing a golden opportunity to address challenges Dealing with the cost of living is the most popular preference across all socio-demographic groups, with 69% of voters aged under 25 wanting the focus on this area There is a desire among voters that when he unveils his first budget as Minister for Finance, Jack Chambers should bring forward measures to continue to provide support to the Irish public in dealing with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. This is the focus of the Irish Times/Ipsos B&A Poll results published today as the Government prepares for a pre-election budget. Fieldwork for this poll was conducted between September 14th and September 17th among a nationally representative sample of 1,200 voters aged 18 years and upwards. All constituencies were sampled, with interviewing conducted in-home by Ipsos B&A interviewers. Percentages are reliable to within approximately 2.8 per cent in either direction. When presented with a list of options and asked which one they would like the Government to place emphasis on in the upcoming budget, exactly half (50 per cent) of poll respondents expressed a preference for a focus on immediate help with the cost of living. Next most popular was to increase spending on public services (24 per cent) and to reduce the amount of personal tax paid (16 per cent). Least popular was to save surplus resources to invest in the future (8 per cent). Further support in dealing with the cost of living is the most popular preference across all socio-demographic groups, and is highest among younger voters with 69 per cent of voters aged under 25 wanting an emphasis to be placed on this area. In turn, younger voters are least likely to express a preference for increased spending on public services, with 11 per cent selecting this option. Addressing the cost of living is also the most popular choice right across the political spectrum, although some intricacies can be found in the data. Support for cost-of-living measures is highest among Sinn Féin voters and those voting for an Independent candidate or smaller party (64 per cent and 50 per cent respectively). While it is also the most popular choice among Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael voters (46 per cent and 38 per cent respectively), it is notable that these voters express a desire for a broader range of measures. Fine Gael voters are more likely than supporters of other parties to want to see a reduction in the level of personal taxation, with 21 per cent indicating that this is where the Government’s emphasis should lie. No doubt the €13 billion expected from the Apple tax judgment was on respondents’ minds when considering the financial options available to the Government, and this was the focus of a separate question in this poll. Exactly half (50 per cent) responded that the funds should be spent on housing and other pressing needs. This is well ahead of the other options of paying off some of the national debt (7 per cent) and saving for the future (5 per cent). Respondents were also given the option of indicating that the Government should allocate the spending across a mixture of these three areas, with 36 per cent preferring this approach. It is striking that the clear preference of voters is that this windfall should be used to address immediate challenges rather than adopting a more conservative approach in respect of future savings or paying down the national debt. Some differences in opinion are again evident across the political spectrum. Sinn Féin voters are more likely to want to see this additional money spent on housing and other pressing needs, with 65 per cent choosing this option. In contrast, a lower proportion of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael supporters select this option (44 per cent and 41 per cent respectively) but instead are more likely than Sinn Féin voters to want to see the money spent on a mixture of things (42 per cent and 41 per cent respectively). A delicate balancing act as the Government finalises the details of the budget and also ponders what to do with a massive tax windfall. A strained electorate perhaps senses a golden opportunity to immediately address a broad range of challenges before heading to the voting booths.",0,1
2024/9/20,"Harris lauds Land Development Agency’s almost 600-home Dublin scheme  Project at Shanganagh Castle, near Shankill, the agency’s first direct-build scheme on publicly owned lands   The Land Development Agency’s (LDA) almost 600-home development at Shanganagh Castle, Co Dublin, will serve as an “exemplar” for many more similar schemes from the agency in the years ahead, Taoiseach Simon Harris has said. The scheme is the agency’s first direct-build development on publicly owned lands. Almost half of the 597 homes are ready for occupation on the new development near Shankill, Co Dublin. It is a mix of affordable, cost-rental, and social homes. This is the biggest project undertaken by the LDA since its establishment in 2019. The project has been done in conjunction with Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council In all, 281 A2-rated homes have now been completed under the first phase and will now be offered to potential purchasers and tenants: 195 on the cost rental model; and 86 affordable homes. Cost-rental homes will be available from €1,175 per month, which is 25 per cent less than market value. The affordable homes will sell at €334,000 for a two-bedroom and about €380,000 for a three-bedroom. Council chief executive Frank Curran said the median price for a similar house in the county was €650,000. Buyers of affordable homes can also avail of State schemes, such as Help to Buy. There will be about 200 social homes in the development when completed. A Dart station is being built nearby to serve the new population. “Shanganagh Castle is an exemplar,” said Mr Harris. “This is the model we need to see roll-out right across this country at great speed to help meet the housing needs of our society.” At the launch, Mr Harris and Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien emphasised what they portrayed as the success of the LDA model on which much of the Government’s housing policy depends. The performance of the agency will be a central debating point in the forthcoming election, as the main Opposition party Sinn Féin wants it abolished and absorbed into two new agencies. “We have delivered, as a Government 116,000 homes up to July this year,” said Mr O’Brien. LDA chief executive John Coleman said 18,000 homes were now in the pipeline for the agency and between 6,000-7,000 would be on site by the end of 2025. The LDA, he said, has resubmitted planning permission for 934 homes at the site of the former Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum. In a response to the launch, Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin said the Coalition and LDA were “disingenuous” in terms of the prices being stated publicly. He claimed that because prices were linked to market value and not to cost of delivery, both the rents and the State share of equity would be higher. He surmised the larger three-bedroom homes could have State equity of up to €170,000 and the rent for larger homes could be €1,800 per month or more.",0,1
2024/9/20,"Cheap loans for builders and more money for Irish Water among Ministers’ proposals for Apple tax billions It is understood Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien will target expanded funding for the Land Development Agency to build 20,000 homes by 2030, as well as a low-interest loan fund for builders Low-cost loans for builders, digital health records and extra funds for the Land Development Agency are being sought by Cabinet Ministers jockeying for allocations from the Apple billions. While Coalition leaders have ruled out using the funds for this year’s budgetary cycle, tax cuts or current spending on the likes of public sector wages, Taoiseach Simon Harris has signalled that some clarity about the €14 billion windfall will come on budget day. That looks set to prompt a round of intense lobbying by line Ministers eager to bid for some of the money, which is due to arrive into the exchequer in the coming months after Apple and Ireland lost a long-running case arguing that the tax was not due to the State. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has developed a proposal around projects that could be funded using the Apple windfall or the proceeds of the State’s sale of its remaining stake in AIB. It is understood that he will target expanded funding for the Land Development Agency to build 20,000 homes by 2030, as well as a low-interest loan fund for builders and non-profit Approved Housing Bodies, which would be administered through the Housing Finance Agency and Home Building Finance Agency. He will also seek increased funding for Irish Water to accelerate projects deemed vital for housing, particularly wastewater facilities in rapidly growing towns. Meanwhile, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly will push for funding to roll out long-sought digital health records across the health service amid growing frustration over the antiquated systems in use, many of which still rely on pen and paper. Sources close to Mr Donnelly argued: “These are digital proceeds. Parts of the HSE are still using clipboards, pen and paper. Many of our hospitals have no access to wifi. We are asking our doctors and nurses to still use fax machines, pagers and queue up to use still too few terminals.” Mr Donnelly has told colleagues that this is a huge frustration for staff and interrupts time with patients, instead wasting time on solving “process problems”. He will argue the lack of technology is having a major impact on improving efficiency in the health service. A patient app is due to be unveiled later in the year and a broader digital plan was published with a corresponding roadmap but it has yet to be funded, while former HSE boss Tony O’Brien has blamed the Department of Public Expenditure for blocking delivery of e-health technologies “leaving Ireland at the bottom of the digital health pile in Europe”. It is unclear how specific the Government will be about the destination of the €14 billion on budget day, with senior Government sources of the view that projects without planning permission or a firm budget cannot realistically expect to be allocated money. The Opposition has strongly criticised the Government’s intention to signal its intent around the money, with Sinn Féin saying it will be for voters to indicate their preferences through the general election. The party has said it would spend €1 billion on a fund for underprivileged communities. At Monday’s meeting of Coalition leaders, alongside Minister for Finance Jack Chambers and Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe, high-level principles about allocating the money were agreed, with a focus on infrastructure investments and how that might overlap with existing capital plans. It is understood that State bodies identified during talks as candidates to receive money included Irish Water, EirGrid and the Land Development Agency.",0,1
2024/9/21,"Sinn Féin adds former party press officer to its general election ticket in Cork Joe Lynch will run with sitting TD Thomas Gould in Cork North Central, which has gone from a four-seat to a five-seat constituency Sinn Féin has chosen its former press officer Joe Lynch to run with sitting TD Thomas Gould in a bid to take two seats in Cork North Central, which has gone from being a four-seat to a five-seat constituency. Mr Lynch, from Ballincollig, was elected to Cork City Council in June’s local elections, and his selection is seen as key to the party’s hopes of taking a second seat, as Ballincollig, with an electorate of 20,000, was transferred from Cork North West to Cork North Central in the constituency revisions. Mr Gould from Gurranebraher is expected to poll well in his native northside of the city, but the constituency has also been expanded to included Mallow in North Cork where some 14,000 votes are transferring from Cork East to Cork North Central to meet the numbers to make it a five-seater. In a statement, Mr Lynch (35), a  father of one, said he was proud to have been selected by the Sinn Féin membership, and he identified the new parts of the constituency as somewhere that needs Dáil representation. “Ballincollig is my hometown. I care about the village, the communities that make it up and its people passionately. We have been without a TD of our own for far too long, and with over ten years’ experience of working in Leinster House, I am up for the job and ready to hit the ground running.” Mr Gould, a native of Knocknaheeny who lives in Gurranebraher in the heart of Cork’s northside, has been a public representative for 15 years. In 2020, he was elected to the Dáil for the first time. He warmly welcomed Mr Lynch to the Sinn Féin ticket and expressed confidence the party would win two seats in the general election as he identified housing and a clean water supply as being two issues in particular that the party will seek to address. “This general election is our best possible chance at real and radical change on the problems facing ordinary people – housing, healthcare, the need for additional Garda numbers, access to services for children with disabilities and the cost of living,” he said.",0,1
2024/9/21,"The vague and shifting politics of Conor McGregor: from pro-lockdown to anti-immigration and beyond The mixed martial arts fighter admires Putin and Trump, has Elon Musk’s seal of approval and says he is logical choice to be next president of Ireland despite appearing to have a poor grasp of the role As a general rule, Irish constitutional scholars do not pay much attention to the world of mixed martial arts. That changed earlier this month when the UFC star Conor McGregor proclaimed on X that he is the “only logical choice” for the next president of Ireland. The sports star outlined his intention to use the office to make politicians “answer to the people of Ireland”. If he does not like the answers he receives, McGregor announced, he will “be left with no choice but to dissolve the Dáil entirely”. In the immediate aftermath, a WhatsApp group containing the country’s leading experts on the Constitution lit up and began dissecting the UFC fighter’s broad interpretation of presidential powers. The verdict was not kind. Amid the emojis and gifs, the scholars arrived at the consensus that McGregor’s interpretation is, to put it kindly, constitutionally illiterate. “He has a deeply, deeply mistaken understanding of the Constitution,” says Tom Hickey, associate professor in constitutional law at Dublin City University. Hickey says McGregor, or those working for him, appear to have fundamentally misread Article 13.2.1, which states that the President shall summon and dissolve the Dáil but only “on the advice of the Taoiseach”. “It seems he read the first half of the sentence without reading the last six words,” says Hickey. “The point is the president absolutely does not have the power to summon and dissolve the Dáil on his own.” Other Irish observers were similarly unimpressed, with many noting that if he decides to run, the Crumlin-raised fighter will have an uphill battle in even getting on the ballot. The signatures of 20 members of the Oireachtas or the support of four local authorities are required to secure a nomination. Outside Ireland, the reaction tended to be far more positive. “Conor McGregor might be president of Ireland before he fights again in the UFC,” reported the US news channel CBS. “His odds of becoming the next president of Ireland are surely better than his odds of winning another UFC title,” Forbes stated. “Awesome,” said billionaire Elon Musk in response. Andrew Tate, a notorious online influencer who is awaiting trial in Romania on charges of rape and human trafficking, said he had an Irish passport and promised to vote for McGregor (only residents of Ireland can vote in the presidential election). The next Irish presidential election is due to take place next year. Whether McGregor’s announcement is merely posturing, a PR stunt for his various businesses or a genuine intention to enter electoral politics remains an open question. What is clear is that in recent years he has embraced the image of a populist in the mould of Donald Trump, happy to espouse far-right talking points and anti-immigrant sentiments, while claiming to speak for those left behind by establishment politics. McGregor has publicly called Russian president Vladimir Putin “one of the greatest leaders of our time” and Trump one of the greatest US presidents of all time. He has claimed that Ireland is “at war” and called for buildings earmarked for asylum seeker accommodation to be “evaporated”. He has also, according to various sources, been involving in Irish politics in more subtle ways not announced on his social media feeds. In the run-up to the local elections last June, McGregor quietly encouraged a number of associates to run on an anti-immigration platform. Philip Sutcliffe, a former Olympic boxer, was one approached by the MMA fighter and asked to run. Sutcliffe, a veteran coach in Crumlin Boxing Club who occasionally helps McGregor in his pre-fight training, was persuaded to run for Dublin City Council just over a month before polling day. He ran in two areas as part of Independent Ireland, a newly formed political party, and secured a seat in the Ballyfermot/Drimnagh ward with 6.7 per cent of first-preference votes. Since his election in June, Sutcliffe has informally aligned himself with other anti-immigration candidates who won seats and has shared false information about anti-immigration protests. In July he was the only member of the council’s south central area committee not to endorse a motion condemning arson attacks on the former Crown Paints factory in Coolock, north Dublin, that was earmarked for asylum seeker accommodation. Sutcliffe, who did not respond to requests for comment, told a hearing of the committee that he condemned attacks against gardaí and firefighters but also falsely claimed gardaí had set their own cars on fire during the violence, drawing sharp rebukes from his fellow councillors. “The mask slipped. It was totally bizarre. It was Trump-esque,” recalls one of those present at the hearing. Despite his relationship with Sutcliffe, it appears unlikely McGregor can rely on the support of Independent Ireland if he decides to run for president. “I wouldn’t be voting for him. He has nothing to do with the [party leadership],” says one of party’s elected representatives, who does not want to be named. “Phil trained boxers. That’s how he knows him.” As well as publicly criticising politicians on social media, McGregor has also been privately contacting senior State officials about his grievances. In the past two years, senior security officials in the Garda and Defence Forces have been receiving occasional emails from McGregor, demanding they take action against immigration. At least one email referred to an “invasion”, say sources who are familiar with his contacts. McGregor did not respond to request for comment through his management company nor did his solicitor in Ireland, Graham Kenny. Before 2020 McGregor showed little interest in political affairs, according to an archive of his social media posts, many of which McGregor has since deleted from his feed. “Fuck politics and fuck religion,” he tweeted after being criticised for wearing a Remembrance Day poppy in 2015. That seemed to change in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he took the view that the restrictions imposed by the Government were too lax and implored the then minister for finance, Paschal Donohoe, to deploy “more units on the street to enforce this lockdown”. As the pandemic wore on, he gradually became more anti-establishment and occasionally conspiratorial in his pronouncements. In November 2022, when the first of a long series of protests against asylum seeker accommodation began in East Wall, Dublin, McGregor expressed his support for the demonstrators. It was another year before the extremity of his position on immigration became clear. “Do not let any Irish property be took over unannounced. Evaporate said property. It’s a war,” he posted on X in November 2023. After the start of the Dublin riots on November 23rd, McGregor posted “You reap what you sow” as violence and looting spread through the city centre. He later condemned the violence. His comments drew praise from far-right activists in the US and UK. AI-generated images showing McGregor brandishing an assault rifle and standing in front of a burning bus circulated widely online. McGregor’s statements also drew attention from gardaí tasked with examining the social media posts of far-right figures accused of inciting the violence. Nothing came of the investigation after investigators determined McGregor’s comments did not meet the criminal threshold. It was around then that McGregor, with the encouragement of Musk and other prominent figures, first began suggesting a run for Áras an Uachtaráin. In the subsequent months, McGregor came out against the Government’s stalled hate speech Bill and called for a No vote in the family and care referendums. However, he seemed to put his political aspirations on the back burner, instead focusing on promoting his whiskey and stout brands and his planned UFC comeback fight against Michael Chandler. Now that fight has been postponed until next year at the earliest, and he seems to be in the twilight of his sporting career. This may make a run for the presidency more likely. However, even if he somehow manages to secure a nomination, he will have a mountain to climb. The only credible poll to ask about a McGregor candidacy, conducted by the Sunday Independent shortly after the Dublin riots, put his support at 8 per cent. While his support may not win him the presidency, his money and fame means he is likely to be a powerful force behind Ireland’s growing anti-immigrant movement in the years to come.",0,1
2024/9/21,"Almost four in 10 voters want Simon Harris as taoiseach after next election, Irish Times poll shows Harris supported by 37% of voters polled, while Mary-Lou McDonald is the second most popular candidate at 24% and Micheál Martin ranks third with 14% Today’s Irish Times/Ipsos B&A poll reveals that almost four in 10 voters (37 per cent) would like to see Simon Harris as taoiseach after the next general election. Mary-Lou McDonald is the second most popular candidate at 24 per cent, while Micheál Martin ranks in third position at 14 per cent. A further 15 per cent favour another option and 10 per cent did not express a preference. Fieldwork for this poll was conducted between September 14th and 17th among a nationally representative sample of 1,200 voters aged 18 years and upwards. All constituencies were sampled, with interviewing conducted in-home by Ipsos B&A interviewers. Percentages are reliable to within about 2.8 per cent in either direction. That Harris is the most popular candidate should come as no great surprise following the Irish Times/Ipsos B&A poll results published on Thursday, which showed his satisfaction rating at 55 per cent – a 17-point increase since our last poll in May. Harris enjoys broad support to be the next taoiseach, but it is not universal. Younger voters (aged 18 to 24) would prefer to see McDonald as taoiseach, with 36 per cent opting for the Sinn Féin leader and 26 per cent choosing the Fine Gael leader. Voters in the C2DE socioeconomic grouping – lower-income voters – are evenly split with 31 per cent opting for  Harris and the same proportion choosing McDonald. The voters most likely to support Harris being the next taoiseach are those aged 65 and over, at 48 per cent, and those in Dublin, at 42 per cent. As one would expect, the vast majority of Fine Gael (82 per cent) and Sinn Féin (81 per cent) voters would like to see their respective leaders become taoiseach. However, it is striking that just 48 per cent of Fianna Fáil voters would like to see Micheál Martin as taoiseach, while 38 per cent favour Harris. Notably, only 3 per cent of Fianna Fáil voters would like to see McDonald elected as taoiseach. Regardless of whether or not Harris goes on to lead the next government, decisions on its formation lie ahead. As part of our poll, potential coalition options were presented to voters. A Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael only coalition was the most popular choice among 22 per cent of voters, narrowly beating a continuation of the current Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Green coalition, which is supported by 21 per cent of voters. A further 16 per cent would like to see a government led by Sinn Féin without either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, 7 per cent would like a Sinn Féin-Fianna Fáil coalition and 5 per cent would like a Sinn Féin-Fine Gael coalition, 14 per cent would like another combination and 15 per cent are undecided. Both Fianna Fáil (48 per cent) and Fine Gael (47 per cent) voters would prefer their parties return to a coalition government consisting solely of the two parties. For both sets of voters this is preferable to continuing the current coalition with the Green Party, which garners the support of 29 per cent of Fianna Fáil voters and 34 per cent of Fine Gael voters. Understandably, the majority of Green Party voters (67 per cent) would like to see the current arrangement remain in place. A similar proportion of Sinn Féin voters (66 per cent) would like to see a government led by their party without either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Before any coalition can be formed the votes must be cast. Today’s poll also provides an insight into the issues most likely to influence voter decisions in the next election.",0,1
2024/9/22,"President Michael D Higgins accuses Israeli embassy of leaking letter Embassy rejects allegation, calling it ‘baseless’, ‘highly inflammatory’ and ‘potentially slanderous’ President Michael D Higgins has accused Israel of leaking a congratulatory letter he wrote to the newly elected president of Iran Masoud Pezeshkian. Mr Higgins was criticised last month by some politicians for the letter, a copy of which originally circulated on social media. The letter outlined Mr Higgins’s view that stability and co-operation and the peaceful resolution of disputes “have never been more important across the whole Middle East region”. “Iran with its long tradition of culture will play a crucial role in achieving this,” he noted. The Israeli embassy said the letter could have been an opportunity to condemn Iranian funding of terrorism and incitement of “Jihadi terrorist organisations like Hizbullah, Hamas and the Houthis”. Speaking in New York on Sunday, where he addressed a United Nations event, Mr Higgins said his letter “was a standard one I have written to many heads of state, and I stressed in it the importance of peace in the region, and the importance as well of diplomacy returning in relation to the resolution of disputes and so forth”. Asked if he knew how the letter got out, he said: “I do indeed. It was circulated from the Israeli embassy.”* He said he had “no idea” how this came about. The Israeli embassy in Dublin responded to the accusation on Sunday night. It said: “This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous and the embassy rejects it completely. The fact remains that the letter was written and therefore it is the burden of the author to defend its content, which did not mention the threat Iran poses in the region, that it calls for Israel’s destruction, that it arms and funds terrorist organisations like Hamas and Hizbullah, not to mention the violations of human rights against its own citizens.” On Sunday night the President’s spokesman said the exchange of letters upon the coming to office of a new head of State is standard diplomatic practice for countries which share diplomatic relations. As is usual practice, the letter in question was drafted based on material supplied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and issued via standard diplomatic channels. Such letters have been sent to incoming presidents of Iran for a number of decades. In response to questions, the President’s spokesman indicated his view that this standard diplomatic letter had been circulated over the summer and presented as being something out of the ordinary. The President made no accusations of a leak, he solely referred to the letter being circulated, he said. Asked about the President’s comments on Israel and the letter to Iran, Taoiseach Simon Harris said: “I have no evidence or information as to how a letter written by the President of Ireland to the president of Iran came into the public domain, none whatsoever. “What I do know as a statement of fact ... is that the Israeli embassy did comment on his letter on a number of occasions. The point I am making is that you would  imagine that the government of a country that is carrying out a humanitarian catastrophe that has seen thousands of children killed would have better things to be doing than parsing the words of our President.” Earlier in New York the President said he did not believe the Irish housing and homelessness crisis was linked to rising immigration levels, following comments by Taoiseach Simon Harris that immigration levels are having an impact on homeless numbers. Mr Harris in a Sunday newspaper interview said the “very serious volume of people coming to the country is now having a real impact”. “People understand the fact that homelessness numbers are heavily impacted by the fact we are seeing many people seek protection in our country, seek asylum in our country and many people come from abroad hoping to have a new future in Ireland and immigration, it has many, many pluses, but it has had a challenge there,” Mr Harris told the Sunday Times. Mr Higgins was asked, following his UN address, if he believes the homeless crisis has been caused by immigration. “No, I do not. I also have a very definite view that I expressed before in relation to the approach to housing. I think that the approaches so far have been both limited and damaged by the fact that they’re all responses to the market. “It is, to me, inconceivable that the State would own land. The State would have a reputation of producing building workers, that it is open to getting workers from abroad for other purposes, and that you still wouldn’t, in fact, be directly building houses, but I’m not in government as I will, no doubt, be reminded. And the fact is, I’m not responsible for housing policy, but the views I expressed then, I would be expressing them stronger now.” The Taoiseach’s comments were also seized upon by Opposition parties. Social Democrats TD Gary Gannon said Mr Harris “should now clarify his comments and correct the record”. “The Taoiseach is entitled to his opinions, but he is not entitled to his own facts. The fact is that those seeking international protection are not counted in the monthly homeless numbers. It is only those living in emergency accommodation who are counted in those figures.” People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy branded the Taoiseach’s comments as “cynical, untrue and dangerous”. Latest figures indicate more than 14,400 people are homeless. Asked how he would characterise the Government’s handling of the housing crisis, Mr Higgins said he wouldn’t comment on any particular government. However, when it was put to him that it was an abject failure to have thousands of homeless families, he said: “There’s no doubt whatsoever that as one looks at it ... I have to answer the question properly now, it has failed in many dimensions. The planning is a disaster. There aren’t enough planning officers working for the local authorities.” He also said some State housing interventions were designed to “seduce the market”. Last night, the Taoiseach doubled down on the comments he made  linking the housing  and homelessness crisis with rising immigration levels. Speaking ahead of a week of engagements at the United Nations in New York on Sunday night, he said the statistics are there to back up his claims. “I did absolutely make the point that there is no doubt that there is a link between the migration challenge we face and the homeless challenge – although not the entirety of the homelessness crisis, of course not. “But if you look at the figures, for example, for the month of July in Dublin, the single biggest reason people gave for presenting at the Dublin homeless services was exiting direct provision. And if you look at the figures for Dublin over the summer months ... you will see that around 20 to 24 per cent of people who present come from countries outside the European Economic Area, and I think around a similar percentage present from either the UK or the EU,” Mr Harris said. “So the point I was making, and I stand by it, is that over the last number of years, we’ve seen a growing population. Over the last number of years, we’ve seen many people come to our country. I did point out in that interview and reiterate again today, immigration is a good thing. Our country benefits from immigration, but it is important to unpack an issue when you want to try and bring about solutions to it. “There is absolutely no doubt that a rising population and a rising number of people coming to our country, of course, has an impact on supply. Of course, that’s not the fault of anybody. It’s not to apportion blame, and it’s certainly not to apportion blame to vulnerable people. But the figures speak for themselves, and the data is there for all people to see.” * This article was amended on 23/09/24 to clarify Mr Higgins’ comment to reporters. He said “it was circulated from the Israeli embassy” rather than “it was certainly the Israeli embassy”, as had initially been reported.",0,1
2024/9/23,"Immigration is ‘a factor’ contributing to homeless numbers, says Darragh O’Brien Minister for Housing backs Taoiseach’s position after Simon Harris linked immigration to numbers in emergency accommodation Immigration is “a factor” contributing to the number of homeless people in emergency accommodation, according to Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien. Simon Harris faced Opposition criticism after comments where he suggested immigration levels are having a “real impact” on homeless numbers. Mr O’Brien backed the Taoiseach’s position on Monday. During an interview with The Sunday Times, Mr Harris said: “People understand the fact that homelessness numbers are heavily impacted by the fact we are seeing many people seek protection in our country, seek asylum in our country, and many people come from abroad hoping to have a new future in Ireland, and immigration, it has many, many pluses, but it has had a challenge there.” At a press conference in Dublin on Monday Mr O’Brien said homelessness is “complex” and that his department publishes figures every month on exits from homelessness and entries into emergency accommodation and the reasons why. He said: “It can be relationship break-up, it can be in relation to notices to quit in the private sector, but we have seen in the last number of months – and I think that’s just what the Taoiseach was speaking to as well – in the area of new arrivals as well is, particularly with singles, is a factor.” Mr O’Brien said the State has a “moral duty” to support people with emergency accommodation. Asked about the proportion of foreign nationals in emergency homeless accommodation Mr O’Brien said around 42 per cent to 44 per cent of people in such accommodation in Dublin are foreign nationals including those from the European Economic Area (EEA) and non-EEA countries. Mr O’Brien added: “We have seen an increase in the last three months particularly in singles, those with status in direct provision, who have left direct provision, and that’s the single biggest reason for those entering into State emergency accommodation that we’re providing.” He said accommodation will be provided to them, that Ireland is a caring country. “and we make no distinction between one cohort of people and another”. Asked for an update on proposals surrounding a habitual residence condition for emergency homeless accommodation that Mr O’Brien was reported earlier this year to be examining, he said the relevant legislation from 1988 is being reviewed. Speaking on Monday, Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman said it was important to be “very clear” that asylum seekers have “no right” to claim housing supports, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) or to access homelessness accommodation. Asked about the Taoiseach’s comments, Mr O’Gorman said “we need to be clear” on the facts about asylum seekers and their impact on housing. He said  the “whole reason my department has led the response to people fleeing Ukraine and people seeking international protection” was to ensure those cohorts had no impact on the work of the Department of Housing, which provides housing supports and oversees delivery of social and affordable housing. “That is why my department over the past year at its height was providing accommodation to over 100,000 people. “Ultimately the solution to homelessness is the building of more housing. There were no houses built virtually between 2009 and 2019. This Government has taken a really important step forward in terms of increasing those construction rates. We will hopefully see 40,000 homes built this year, bringing it up to 50,000 next year. That is how we are going to address the housing needs of everybody.” Mr O’Gorman said he agreed with the Taoiseach’s statement that we shouldn’t blame vulnerable people for the lack of housing. People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy argued the Taoiseach’s comments were “cynical, untrue and dangerous”. Mr Harris later stood over his comments, saying: “I did absolutely make the point that there is no doubt that there is a link between the migration challenge we face and the homeless challenge – although not the entirety of the homelessness crisis, of course not. “But if you look at the figures, for example, for the month of July in Dublin, the single biggest reason people gave for presenting at the Dublin homeless services was exiting direct provision.” During a visit to New York for an address to the United Nations, President Michael D Higgins was asked if he believes the homeless crisis has been caused by immigration, and he replied: “No, I do not.” He was also asked how he would characterise the Government’s handling of the housing crisis, but Mr Higgins said he would not comment on any particular Government.

Addressing Mr Higgins’s remarks on planning, Mr O’Brien said: “We’ve nearly concluded the most significant reform of our planning system” with a new law that, when enacted, will “provide certainty, clarity and consistency across our planning system”. Asked if the State has been too reliant on the private sector to deliver homes he replied: “No, I don’t think so actually. I think the Housing for All plan is the single biggest intervention any Government has made in the history of the State.” He added: “We’ll invest over €5 billion in housing this year and we need all sectors of the development community pushing in the same direction.” Mr O’Brien was speaking in Deansgrange, South Dublin, as Co-operative Housing Ireland (CHI) unveiled 120 new homes.",0,1
2024/9/23,"Renters in line for tax credit of up to €1,000 per year under budget proposals Extra €250 for this year and for 2025 being discussed as deliberations continue Tenants would be in line for an extra €250 in renters’ tax credit under proposals under consideration in the budget. Increasing the current level of the credit from €750 to €1,000 is being discussed as budget talks continue. The moved is being pushed by Fianna Fáil, with Minister for Finance Jack Chambers and Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien saying they would like to see the rent tax credit increased in recent months. Under the current rent tax credit regime the amount of the credit a tenant can apply for is a maximum of €750 for an individual or €1,500 for jointly tax assessed married couples or civil partners. The budget proposals, if adopted, would mean renters would be in line for an extra €250 for 2024, on top of the €750 already available and would be able to make such an application from January. The level of rent tax credit would also be increased to €1,000 for 2025 so in effect individuals could claim up to €2,000 over the two years. Couples who are jointly assessed for tax would be in line for up to €2,000 rent tax credit for both 2024 and 2025. Speaking on Monday Mr O’Brien said he would welcome just increases to the renters’ tax credit being introduced in Budget 2025. He said: “The renters’ tax credit is a significant measure to help reduce the cost for renters out there. Rents are too high. That’s why we’ve been focusing on delivering more cost rental and cost rental at scale. For those who are in the rental market the renters’ tax credit really helps them. “So we haven’t agreed a figure yet because that would be a matter for all of Government together to agree across the three parties, but I certainly have been looking for and discussing with [Mr Chambers] as well a significant increase in the renters’ tax credit and if that can be applied this year and indeed next.” He said: “That’s something I would welcome and I’m sure a lot of renters would welcome as well.”",0,1
2024/9/23,"Companies in breach of Irish air space rules may be banned, says Taoiseach  Airlines carrying ‘munitions of war’ over State must apply for permission before crossing with ordnance  Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said “quite a number” of flights have violated Irish sovereign air space as he indicated the Government may consider a ban on companies found to be in breach of travel rules. On Monday, The Irish Times reported that nine flights alleged to have carried military weapons destined for Israel passed through Irish sovereign air space since the war in Gaza began. The information came on foot of a Government investigation. The Department of Transport launched the inquiry earlier this month following a series of reports on an online news site, outlining a number of flights alleged to have carried various types of explosives, ammunition and military goods destined for the Israel Defence Forces or Israeli arms companies since October 2023. Under Irish law, airlines carrying “munitions of war” must apply for permission from the Minister for Transport before bringing the goods through Irish sovereign air space. The department has previously confirmed that no licences for the transport of such goods to Israel were sought in 2023 or to date in 2024. Speaking at the United Nations headquarters in New York, Mr Martin said there must be consequences for companies that flout Irish laws. “In terms of planes flying in Irish air space, sovereign air space, Government never received any requests. The Department of Transport has been engaging the relevant authorities in respect of this and the particular company. And we facilitated in terms of dialogue with the Belgian government. “Clearly now there have been quite a number of flights that have been in violation of our sovereign air space. It now remains for Government, as we go forward, to get further clarifications and verification of the cargo on those planes to take whatever actions. I think the basic action is the possibility of saying to those companies that you may not fly through Irish aerospace, if you violate the basic rules that govern this.” Asked if he was in favour of such a ban, he replied: “That’s about what we can do … But in the multilateral world, we expect companies to abide by the basic rules. And the basic rules here are, if you wish to bring a cargo through our sovereign air space, and then that gets considered by the Department of Transport, that’s the norm. “That’s what happens, and we expect airlines to comply with that. And if they don’t there has to be consequences, but that’s a matter of the Government which will we consider once we get a final report from the department.”",0,1
2024/9/23,"‘I did not use the word leak’: Higgins says he does not regret comments about Israeli embassy circulating letter Taoiseach says he is not going to fall into ‘trap from Israel’ of making letter into an issue President Michael D Higgins has said he has no regrets about comments he made in New York about the Israeli embassy circulating a letter he sent to the newly-elected president of Iran. Mr Higgins was criticised last month by some politicians over the letter, a copy of which originally circulated on social media. On Sunday he told journalists the letter had been circulated by the Israeli embassy, but that he did not know how they obtained it. “You should ask where the criticism came from and how the letter was circulated and by whom and for what purpose. It was circulated from the Israeli embassy.” The comments were widely interpreted as Mr Higgins believing that the letter had been leaked, although a spokesman for the President said he had “made no accusations of a leak”. At a press conference on Monday afternoon in New York, Mr Higgins was asked if he has any regrets about his original comments following strong criticism from the Israeli embassy. “Not at all. Let me just say, and it is all I’m going to say on the subject, it is quite a formal letter that I send out when there is change in a head of state. I worded a letter and I stressed in it how we had to use all of our energies towards achieving peace in the region,” Mr Higgins said. “The point is that a statement was issued from the embassy saying the President has written and ‘why hasn’t he said this and why hasn’t he said this’. And frankly that was unusual and many would regard it in diplomatic circles as improper. That is all I wish to say on this matter. I did not use the word leak. I used the word circulated, and we have confirmed that.” In tense exchanges with the media he said it was journalists’ responsibility if they decided to “to put a spin on the language. You take responsibility for your language”. Mr Higgins added: “I think that my letter appeared on the Iranian website. Very unusually then the Israeli embassy composed a letter condemning the President of Ireland for having issued a letter to the incoming president of Iran. And that is that. That is the end of that.” Earlier in the day Taoiseach Simon Harris said he was not going to fall into the “trap from Israel” of making the letter into an issue. “I’ve just come from a meeting where the Palestinian prime minister is broken down in tears about children in his own country being killed by Israel today, and there is at least 21 children that have been killed by Israel in Lebanon today. You’ll excuse me for not getting overly exercised about the issue of a letter... Where the letter came from is utterly irrelevant to the issue at hand.”",0,1
2024/9/24,"Hiring election staff at short notice becoming ‘increasingly difficult’, TDs and Senators told Dublin City returning officer says almost full employment in Ireland means recruitment is ‘becoming more challenging’ The difficulty of hiring election staff at short notice due to full employment has been raised by Dublin city’s top election official with TDs and Senators. Dublin city’s returning officer Joseph Burke highlighted the issue at a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage on Tuesday, saying increased pay rates may be required to attract enough workers. The warning comes as An Coimisiún Toghcháin, the Electoral Commission, outlined how an additional 250,000 people have joined the Electoral Register between last December and June this year. Taoiseach Simon Harris has repeatedly said he intends for the Government to run its full term – which would indicate an election early next year – but there has been rampant speculation in political circles that it will be in November. Mr Burke told the committee how there are  about 125 polling stations for five constituencies in Dublin city and he recruits and trains approximately 1,200 people to work in them on polling day. Poll clerks, presiding officers and supervisors are the roles on offer. Pay for poll clerks in the 2020 general election was €367 for a 16-hour day. However, Mr Burke said that the average net pay for a poll clerk working during recent electoral events was €220 for the day, though he said it depends what tax rate they are on. He said feedback he had gotten from some people he hired previously is they were not prepared to do the work again, telling him this was “because ‘I didn’t think it’s worth my time based on what I got in take-home pay’”. Mr Burke said: “In some cases, particularly Dáil elections, we get very short notice of an electoral event and this can make the recruitment and training of staff difficult.” Mr Burke said his office has always recruited and trained sufficient staff for all electoral events. He said, howerver, that with almost full employment in Ireland, recruitment is “becoming more challenging”. He said: “The rate of pay for the hours that they are required to work and the responsibilities that they have is making it increasingly difficult to retain and recruit staff.” He added that this has been highlighted with the Department of Public Expenditure and his office is “hopeful in the next charges order that the rates of pay can be increased”. A Department of Public Expenditure statement said the charges order was revised earlier this year to take account of increases in public sector pay since 2021. It said the rates applicable were raised by 12.6 per cent. The statement also said: “Subsistence payments are now made to poll clerks, presiding officers and supervisory presiding officers, which was not previously the case” and these changes were applied for the recent local and European elections. It said: “It is intended that going forward the charges order will be revised at the start of each year to take account of any changes to public sector pay arising since the previous order was signed.”",0,1
2024/9/24,"Tánaiste says Irish troops in Lebanon are ‘safe’ in what is ‘a very difficult environment to operate within’ United Nations secretary-general António Guterres says the world is edging towards ‘a powder keg that risks engulfing the world’ Irish troops in Lebanon are “safe” but the Government is “taking all precautions” to keep them that way, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has said. Speaking outside the headquarters of the United Nations for the general assembly on Tuesday, Mr Martin said peacekeepers and UN agencies are “to the heart and at the forefront of protecting civilians and protecting people more generally”. “Our thoughts are with our soldiers in what is a very difficult environment to operate within,” he said. Violence has increased markedly in the past week on the Lebanese side of the border, where Israel killed hundreds of people in strikes on Monday. Mr Martin said he had listened to a “tour de force” speech from United Nations secretary-general António Guterres, who denounced on Tuesday a growing number of governments and other groups who feel they are “entitled to a get out of jail free card”. “We are in an era of epic transformation – facing challenges unlike any we have ever seen – challenges that demand global solutions,” Mr Guterres said. “Yet geopolitical divisions keep deepening. The planet keeps heating. Wars rage with no clue how they will end. And nuclear posturing and new weapons cast a dark shadow. We are edging towards the unimaginable – a powder keg that risks engulfing the world. “Meanwhile, 2024 is the year that half of humanity goes to the polls – and all of humanity will be affected. I stand before you in this whirlwind convinced of two overriding truths. First, the state of our world is unsustainable. We can’t go on like this. And, second, the challenges we face are solvable. But that requires us to make sure the mechanisms of international problem-solving actually solve problems.” Mr Guterres said Gaza was a “non-stop nightmare that threatens to take the entire region with it”. “Look no further than Lebanon. We should all be alarmed by the escalation. Lebanon is at the brink. The people of Lebanon – the people of Israel – and the people of the world – cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza. Let’s be clear. Nothing can justify the abhorrent acts of terror committed by Hamas on October 7th, or the taking of hostages – both of which I have repeatedly condemned. And nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people. The speed and scale of the killing and destruction in Gaza are unlike anything in my years as secretary general.” Taoiseach Simon Harris held a number of bilateral meetings with other world leaders throughout the week in New York. Among those he spoke to were Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He also held bilateral meetings with King Abdullah of Jordan, the president of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas, and Mr Guterres. On Monday night he spoke with former US president Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton; the mayor of London Sadiq Khan; and Gordon and Sarah Brown.

Mr Harris will travel to Washington DC next month, with the exact date of the trip not yet disclosed. A spokesman for the Taoiseach confirmed the trip on Tuesday, as Mr Harris continues with a programme of bilateral and meetings with world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York. After their meeting next month, Mr Harris and President Biden will speak at an event to mark the centenary of bilateral diplomatic relations between Ireland and the US, which was the first country to recognise Ireland’s place among the nations of the world, the Government announced. “The event will also be an opportunity to reflect on President Biden’s career-long friendship with Ireland.” During his visit to Washington DC, Mr Harris will also undertake a number of other engagements. His trip to the White House will come at a time when many believe Mr Harris will be considering whether to call a general election or not. Mr Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin both attended the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, where Mr Biden gave his last speech to the UN as president. After this, Mr Martin officially opened Ireland House in New York, which will house the Consulate General of Ireland in New York, Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland, CIE Tours and The Ireland Funds under one roof. “I have no doubt that Ireland House New York will serve us well in the years ahead as a hub for diplomacy, trade, business, tourism; promoting Irish food and culture and ensure we can maximise our collective impact in New York,” Mr Martin said.

2024/9/25,"‘Ireland sees Palestine’: Taoiseach meets Mahmoud Abbas and pledges to advocate for the state It was the first time since Ireland recognised the state that Simon Harris met the president of the Palestinian Authority  Taoiseach Simon Harris has said he will continue to advocate at a European level for more countries to recognise the state of Palestine. Mr Harris held a meeting with the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, in New York on Tuesday evening. It was their first meeting since Ireland decided to recognise the state of Palestine. Mr Harris, Tánaiste Micheál Martin and President Michael D Higgins all attended the United Nations General Assembly. Speaking after meeting Mr Abbas, Mr Harris said it was “an honour” to meet Mr Abbas and that he intended to put further pressure on EU countries to also recognise Palestinian statehood. “Our heart is breaking for what is happening to people in Palestine. To see so many children and civilians losing their lives, to see the destruction of so much civilian infrastructure,” he said. “I wanted the president of Palestine to know that Ireland sees Palestine. We know what it’s like to live in a country where you have had to really work to be seen to have your right for self-determination. We know what that is like. “There is an absolute right to a Palestinian state, a state that can live in peace and security alongside the state of Israel. I know very clearly, and the people of Ireland know very clearly, that Palestine is not Hamas. Hamas offers the people of Palestine no future.” Mr Harris said a ceasefire and immediate cessation of violence is needed “so the killing can stop, the aid can flow, the hostages can be released and we can get to a point where we can have a political process to bring about a two state solution.” “That was my message to president Abbas. It was an honour to meet him in person. It is the first time I have had the opportunity to meet him since Ireland took the decision to recognise the state of Palestine,” he said, “I will continue to advocate at a European level for more states to recognise Palestine because you cannot have a two state solution if you do not recognise the existence of two states. “I will continue to work on behalf on behalf of the Irish people with other countries in terms of trying to get the aid to flow. I had a good meeting with the King of Jordan in relation to that today.”",0,1
2024/9/25,"Taoiseach Simon Harris says White House meeting with Joe Biden will take place in two weeks General election will not take place on November 15th, Harris insists, amid continued speculation Taoiseach Simon Harris has revealed he will return to the United States in two weeks’ time to meet US president Joe Biden in the White House. While officials had declined to reveal the date of the trip, saying  it is normal White House protocol to only publish presidential diaries a week at a time, Mr Harris revealed further details about the pending trip in an interview with The Irish Times in New York, where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly. When it was put to him that he would be back in the States shortly, he said: “Yes, two weeks.” His trip to Washington DC in early October comes amid continued speculation within political circles that he will call a general election in the same time period. “I’m somewhat kind of flattered and bemused that people in Ireland, well certainly journalists in Ireland, seem to somehow or other think there’s a link between President Biden and his diary and his availability and Irish politics, which, of course, there isn’t. So there is no correlation at all in relation to election timing, and my position on that hasn’t changed. “I doubt it’ll be a long trip, because we’ll obviously have a budget in October, we’ll obviously need to work through all the legislation that flows from that, but it’s an important opportunity, and obviously we want to take the opportunity to  promote Ireland and to promote our links with the US.” Asked whether he would bring forward the committee stage consideration of the Finance Bill, which is due to be considered in early November, he said: “I have no role in that. It’s a matter for the line Minister to schedule those things. We have a budget to get done. We have housing targets to set, a national planning framework to agree. We’ve important legislation around mental health, defamation, all these things to progress. There is a really busy period of time ahead, and when the Government has gone full term, and when our work is done, we will have an election.” He said he has not picked a date. “As the only person who has the ability to seek a dissolution of the Dáil, I’m often bemused as to how people are so certain. I keep reading it’s the 15th of November. It won’t be on the 15th of November.” On the forthcoming budget, Mr Harris said he has an open mind on extending mortgage interest relief, that pensioners could expect a good level of increase in their State payments and that families can expect an increase in the Working Family Payment and the qualified increase payment for a child. “There will certainly be a good level of increase in support for pensioners, for carers, for people with a disability. I do want to focus on this budget, on children. We’ve set up a child poverty unit in my department. We have to now make, I believe, a number of important targeted interventions in relation to child poverty. There’s also children who are living below the poverty line today. “If I am fortunate enough after the next election to be taoiseach, I want to retain the child poverty unit in my department, but I also want to give it a ring-fenced budget. It would really help turbocharge child poverty initiatives if the taoiseach of the day had a ring-fenced budget.” He also revealed that there will be either one or two energy credits in Budget 2025. “There will be an energy credit. We haven’t yet decided the amount. I’d expect it to be fewer than last year. We haven’t made a decision on whether it is one or two.”",0,1

Mr Buttimer lost his seat in the Dáil at the 2016 general election. He was subsequently elected to the Seanad where he was appointed by the Taoiseach as leader of the house. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the party Cork South Central at the 2020 general election, but was re-elected to the Seanad in 2020.

Mr Buttimer said he was “honoured” to have been asked by Taoiseach Simon Harris to contest the next election in the constituency. “Simon Harris is campaigning with a new dedication and a new energy,” he said. “Throughout my career, I have always brought that same dedication and energy, not only to campaigning for Fine Gael at election time, but also to representing the people of Cork and the constituency of Cork South-Central in particular. “My motivation lies in generating ideas and energy, about doing and delivering.” The addition of a third candidate to the Fine Gael ticket in Cork South Central had been expected, in order to give the party a chance of taking a second seat in the five-seater constituency.",0,1
2024/9/25,"Tánaiste says €1.4m cost of Government Buildings security hut is ‘ridiculous’  Details of cost emerge at committee meeting where politicians quizzed OPW on €336,000 Leinster House bike shelter A “beautiful” security hut at Government Buildings cost more than €1.4 million, TDs and Senators have been told. Tánaiste Micheál Martin has called the cost of the hut “ridiculous” and said he was shocked to hear the figure. However, chairman of the Office of Public Works (OPW), John Conlon, said he does not believe the cost of the hut is excessive, given the “hidden” work carried out related to security and communications needs. The details of the cost of the security structure emerged as OPW representatives appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure to be quizzed on the controversial €336,000 Leinster House bike shelter. Green Party TD Steven Matthews asked Mr Conlon about the cost of the “very attractive security hut with a sweeping copper clad roof”, and was told it came to €1.429 million. Mr Conlon said he wanted to emphasise it followed “an extensive review of security in this campus” with the Garda. He said: “Whilst it looks like it is a fairly significant cost, there are very significant mechanical, electrical, security system costs on that.” There was also a “significant cost” for a temporary structure while the building was taking place. He also stressed it was a “completely different” project to the bike shelter. Mr Matthews said: “It’s a beautiful structure”, but asked if the price was excessive. Mr Conlon replied: “I don’t believe it is given the significant security dimensions.” There was “a huge amount of networking”, including power, communications, security and CCTV systems and, Mr Conlon said, “There’s far more to that project than meets the eye”. Mr Matthews asked the OPW representatives to provide the committee with a breakdown of the costs. Meanwhile, documents released by the OPW suggest that the body that runs the Leinster House campus, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission rejected as unacceptable a “cost-effective” option for €336,000 bike shelter to be located elsewhere on the grounds. An OPW report on the bike shed construction shows that during consultations on the project in April 2021, it communicated that its “preferred option” was for a facility deeper inside the complex of buildings, on the West Road close to the members’ restaurant. “The positives were that it was ‘out of sight’, adjacent to an entrance, would not impact on listed buildings and would likely be a cost-effective option to deliver,” the report states. It continues: “The OPW understood that this option would require operational changes relating to security and circulation which were not insurmountable.” However, it outlines that members of the Oireachtas Commission, a body largely composed of politicians and chaired by Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghail, “indicated that provision of covered or uncovered bicycle parking in the West Road was not an acceptable proposition. This was supported by security advice”. The report outlines that the Commission asked that covered bike parking with potential for provision of charging systems for e-bikes be provided on the Merrion Square side of Leinster House, as close to Leinster House as possible. In June 2021, the OPW presented a plan for the bike shed to the Oireachtas Commission, which approved the plan, but no estimates or costings were presented at this juncture. Mr Conlon told Wednesday’s committee meeting that “in future, the OPW will ensure that the Oireachtas Commission is fully informed of costs for all elective projects in Leinster House”. An Oireachtas statement said: “To baldly state that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission rejected as unacceptable a “cost-effective” option for a bicycle shelter in Leinster House is simply untrue.” It added: “The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has no role in relation to the approval of capital expenditure including for the bicycle shelter in Leinster House. “The cost was not paid from the Commission’s budget nor was the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission advised at any stage of what we all now know to be excessive expenditure. “In very simple terms, the OPW is the landlord and we are the tenants.”",0,1
2024/9/25,"Analysis: Tense, eventful week at the United Nations gives everyone plenty to talk about State’s leaders all trod carefully in New York with mixed success as homelessness, migrants, Israel, Palestine and Iran all impinged as part of political reality It’s a well-known fact that when it comes to big foreign trips, the wheels can come off for political leaders very quickly. Mix jet lag with early starts, late finishes, a packed schedule and a hungry media pack and the result is often gaffes, slip-ups and flared tempers. Who can forget Leo Varadkar apologising after regaling an American event with the story of how he had interned in the US at a time “when some parents would have had cause for concern about what would happen to interns in Washington”? Or Enda Kenny rebuking a journalist in Canada for asking him about an election date when he was standing next to a puzzled Justin Trudeau. This week, Taoiseach Simon Harris, Tánaiste Micheál Martin, Green Party Minister Eamon Ryan and President Michael D Higgins travelled to New York for the United Nations general assembly, attended by world leaders. As the press gathered for the first official set-piece of the trip – a press conference with Higgins on Sunday – it looked as though Harris was in hot water already. In an interview with the Sunday Times, he drew a link between homeless numbers and rising immigration levels. His comments drew criticism from the Opposition, and created some anxiety in Government with some officials wondering how much of an issue it was going to become on the trip. Higgins had no problem wading in, saying he did not agree the housing crisis was caused by immigration issues. But it was comments made at the end of his press conference that caused controversy. It seemed clear to the travelling press corps that he was insinuating the Israeli embassy had got their hands on his letter to the newly elected president of Iran and circulated it. How would they have done that, though, he was asked. “I have no idea,” he said. In any event, he said he never used the word “leaked” but at an exceptionally tense press conference the next day, where he repeatedly tried to shut down questions on the topic, he also said he had no regrets. Departmental staff watched on with barely disguised alarm as the President repeatedly butted heads with journalists. As this played out, the Taoiseach blitzed his way through back-to-back bilaterals, roundtable events, multiple press conferences, lunches and dinners. He confessed to having jet lag but his only minor slip-up was revealing the time of his surprise October US trip in an interview with The Irish Times, which officials had refused to disclose up until that point. He closed out the week with a meeting with the president of Palestine, Mahmoud Abbas, and a visit to the New York Irish centre while the Tánaiste announced further humanitarian support for Sudan and Lebanon. Both return to Ireland in the small hours of Thursday morning and will be straight into Cabinet and budget meetings, where the political focus will move to next.",0,1
2024/9/26,"OPW’s penchant for wildly expensive lean-tos would put Kubla Khan to shame Even without the place going nuts about huts, there’s a heightened tension and general giddiness around Leinster House After his big adventure in New York, the Taoiseach skedaddled home sharpish on Wednesday and was back in Dublin at 4am on Thursday. Busy man. Budget to push through. Heavy hints to drop. TDs to torment. White House to visit. Election to call. Maybe Simon Harris should have tarried a while longer in the City That Never Sleeps, seeing as he hardly sleeps himself. Keeping out of sight and out of trouble until that budget is delivered on Tuesday seems such a tempting option. As it is, he dodged a lot of awkward questions in the two days he was away from the Dáil, leaving Ministers to wrestle in his absence with the triple woe of hospitals, housing and huts. It’s a pity Simon couldn’t take in an American football game during his visit. With the quarterbacks shouting “Hut! Hut! Hut!” it would have been like he never left Leinster House. Huts were one of the biggest talking points on Wednesday. The latest cause of construction consternation on the parliamentary campus made its jaw-dropping debut in the afternoon when the finance committee called in representatives of the Office of Public Works for a chat about the new bike shelter. It is not known how long it took them to travel from Xanadu to Kildare Street to confirm that the OPW’s penchant for throwing up wildly expensive lean-tos at the State’s expense would put Kubla Khan to shame. But the trip was worth it for shock value alone. As a dead poet once famously wrote: On Merrion Street did the powers that be a stately security dome decree. Yes, hot on the wheels of the fancy little €336,000 bike stand currently tarting up the tarmac on Leinster Lawn came news of the beautifully imagined pagoda inside the gated narrow side entrance to the Department of Finance that nobody noticed until now. How much did it cost? A snip at €1.429 million. “Ridiculous” pronounced Tánaiste Micheál Martin from New York. Yes, he was there too. As was the former Green Party leader Eamon Ryan. As was President Michael D Higgins. Never mind. Roderic O’Gorman, the Minister for Children, was pressed into action at Leaders’ Questions in an effort to distract from the alarming absence of the four most important men in the country, and they are unanimous with themselves about this. But not even the excitement of Roderic taking the helm could lift the sluggish atmosphere in the Dáil chamber. Everywhere else though, cabin fever was the order of the day. The finance committee had convened to discuss the wonder that is the new bicycle stand, which may be small and open to the elements and exposes political posteriors to soggy saddle syndrome, but is perfectly formed. If you ask us, the whole story has been blown out of proportion. Sure what does €336,000 get a nation these days? Just the one Robert Watt, give or take a few grand, for example. And you can’t chain 36 bicycles to the general secretary of the Department of Health. It was when Green Party TD Stephen Matthews inquired about the Department of Finance’s security hut and was told that this pretty little pavilion cost almost €1½ million that the cabin fever went off the scale. Because that was only the half of it. Even without the place going nuts about huts, cabin fever has been rampant all week in Leinster House. It hit dangerous levels on Wednesday as TDs seeking re-election and Senators nursing aspirations sank further into the maw of general election mania. There was an uptake of business in the bar with deputies who will not be returning and can’t wait to escape sitting back at their leisure and marvelling at the madness going on around them. “Fever is the only way to describe it,” said one of Matthews’s soon-to-be-erstwhile colleagues. “They’re running around collecting their shredding bags – loads of them – and starting to clear the decks. Cartloads of envelopes are going out. I’m watching this with my own eyes. They’re obsessing about the posters. There’s no talking to them.” A big reason for the heightened tension and general giddiness was the sudden notion that a snap election will be called late next week. This took hold among a number of Government deputies who were beside themselves with anticipation. Nobody knows when Simon Harris will jump, but, rather like the creative Kubla Khans in the OPW, nervy politicians are putting two and two together and extravagantly losing the run of themselves. But the budget next week? Doesn’t that have to be passed? Doesn’t the Finance Bill have to go through the Oireachtas before a run to the country? Anything is possible, they say. The Finance Bill and Social Welfare Bill could be lashed through in the two days after the budget, if that’s what the Government wants to do. Simon Harris could call the election on Thursday night. The revenue and excise measures will be passed before midnight on the day as normal. Everything else can be published and promised and implemented a few weeks later, if the electorate likes the offer. As for the 33rd Dáil seeing out its full term, there is a strong argument in Government circles that a term is said to be done and dusted when all the key measures in the programme for government have been commenced or completed. So, theoretically, Simon could waltz into the chamber on Thursday night and fire the starting gun. Highly unlikely, say the more level-headed observers. If nothing else, they insist it isn’t his style. Back in the USA, the Taoiseach let slip during the day that his meeting president Joe Biden – word of this impressive coup only came out on Tuesday – will take place in Washington in two weeks’ time. “That would be one hell of a way to kick-start the opening week of a feelgood campaign,” mused our departure lounge deputy, who is in no way cynical about politics. “It’s all highly, highly improbable but that doesn’t matter for these fellas here now. They’re lashing back the coffees to keep going. Jesus Christ, if they don’t ease up on all this frenzied activity the pent-up excitement will blow the roof off the bicycle shed.”",0,1
2024/9/26,"Occupied Territories Bill: Coalition Ministers note ICJ opinion on illegal Israeli settlements Proposed law, advanced in 2018, aims at banning imports from Israeli settlements on Palestinian land  Senior Government Ministers have highlighted the significance of the recent International Court of Justice (ICJ) advisory opinion on illegal Israeli settlements as they await their legal advice on the Occupied Territories Bill. The Bill, first advanced in 2018 by Independent Senator Frances Black, is aimed at banning imports from Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory. Previous Attorneys General had advised that the Bill was contrary to European Union trade law. The Government has sought fresh legal advice from Attorney General Rossa Fanning on the proposed legislation. Tánaiste Micheál Martin told the Dáil that further advice has been sought from Mr Fanning “in respect of that, but also within the context of the International Court of Justice’s advisory”. Referring to the European Union, he said: “What are the obligations on the union over time in respect of the ICJ’s advisory opinion. I think it’s a very significant turning point and Europe has to face up to that reality.” He was responding to Sinn Féin foreign affairs spokesman Matt Carthy who had highlighted Mr Martin’s support for the Bill when in opposition. In July the UN’s top court ruled that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are in breach of international law and that Israel’s occupation of those territories amounts to long-term annexation which has undermined the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. These were the main findings of a non-binding advisory opinion issued by the ICJ. On Thursday Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman said his party considers the Occupied Territories Bill as “an appropriate way of sanctioning trade from the illegally occupied territories”. Mr O’Gorman said it would be “particularly important” for Mr Fanning to outline the consequences of the ICJ opinion for the interpretation of EU law when he briefs the three Government party leaders shortly. Mr O’Gorman said the Attorney General will be briefing the three party leaders shortly. In the Dáil Mr Carthy also referred to allegations on The Ditch news website claiming that Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe as Minister for Finance had a “secret phone call” with his Israeli counterpart in 2019 confirming that the Government would block the Occupied Territories Bill. The claim was allegedly made in documents leaked from the Israeli ministry of justice. But Mr Martin said he spoke to Mr Donohoe before he came into the Dáil on Thursday morning. “He is clear that he did not make any such phone call and the published diary doesn’t record any such phone call. I think it speaks to people rushing to judgment before ascertaining the full facts. He is very, very clear.”",0,1
2024/9/26,"Tánaiste says problems with land hoarding tax legislation could be resolved in time for budget Discussions between Coalition partners follows major political row during summer over measures to exclude active farmers from impact of the tax The Government aims to have issues around the land hoarding tax resolved in time for the budget, allowing the measure to be implemented following delays over the impact on farmers, Tánaiste Micheál Martin has told the Dáil. The Residential Zoned Land Tax, introduced in last year’s budget, was deferred until February 2025. A major political row erupted between the Government parties in the summer when Minister for Finance Jack Chambers suggested the legislation might have to be deferred further because of the possible impact on farmers. The Green Party insisted, however, that the tax must be introduced, with Minister of State Ossian Smyth stressing that a deferral would not be accepted. Green Party TD Steven Matthews described the plan to defer the tax as “incredible” and “like hiding food in a famine” given the housing crisis, and the Coalition leaders agreed to meet to resolve the issue. Mr Martin told Labour finance spokesman Ged Nash, who raised the issue during Leaders’ Questions, that “the mechanisms devised to enable farmers not to be covered have not worked” and discussions are under way between the three parties, led by the Minister for Finance. Mr Nash had referred to the ESRI’s conclusions that land comprises about 20 per cent of the final cost of a homes. “And we know that you cannot control material costs, you cannot control labour costs and other costs that go into development homes. But you have the responsibility to use the tax system responsibly to disincentivise land hoarding. You can make a real difference overnight.” Mr Martin also said, in reference to the budget, that “housing, water and the grid are essential pillars in terms of the future development of the Irish economy and Irish society”. Funding from the sale of AIB shares would be invested and “the Apple funding as well will be allocated principally to those areas, although no final decisions have been taken”. He said “the issue is, how do we develop a sustainable programme of capital investment” over the next decade “and shelter that then from any sort of winds or storms that might come our way into the intervening period”.",0,1
2024/9/26,"Varadkar and Eastwood speak to Derry students - but only the Catholics show up The word ‘safe’ comes up a lot from the students, as does the desire for a peaceful future, more university places in their home city and the chance of a job locally At their desks and ready to begin are 40 sixth-form students, an MP and a former taoiseach. “I was interested because you always hear about a united Ireland, but you never actually hear about what’s going to happen, if it actually happens,” says Lewis Dobbins from Lumen Christi College in Derry. “I think for me, it’s definitely motivated me to look into what it would actually mean,” says his classmate Liam Wilson. “You hear your parents and grandparents talk, but you just hear what they think, without actually knowing why.” He and pupils from three other Derry schools – St Joseph’s Boys’ School, St Mary’s College and St Brigid’s College – are in the city’s Playhouse theatre to listen to Leo Varadkar, who is about to deliver a speech outlining his thoughts on the next steps towards a referendum on Irish unity as the guest of the SDLP’s New Ireland Commission. First, though, there is work to be done. Varadkar and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood, the outgoing SDLP leader, move from table to table as each group writes down their hopes and fears for the future – and their aspirations for wider society – with big fluorescent markers. The word “safe” comes up a lot; so too does the desire for a peaceful future, for more university places in their home city and the chance of a job here rather than having to move away. “I really enjoyed that we were able to give our perspective on the issue,” says Jenna McLaughlin from St Mary’s College. “I want a united Ireland, and people are obviously going to have varying opinions, but it’s not a thing we talk about.” “It is something that comes up in my household,” says Becca Connolly, also from St Mary’s. “We talk about politics in general, and I have my views and my parents have the same views, but I’m open to having conversations with other people who have opposite views.” “I think I have to learn more about it,” says her friend Anna Mallon. “I don’t think I know enough about it, actually, to make a full-on decision about it.” “I would have wanted a united Ireland anyway, but hearing what Leo [Varadkar] was saying, it makes a stronger case for it, that you’ll get actual benefits from it,” says Dobbins. Acknowledged in Varadkar’s speech – and discussed in the room – was how to make the debate around unification an inclusive one. It did not go unnoticed by the pupils that, while all the city’s second-level schools were invited, only Catholic institutions chose to take part. “When I came into the room I noticed it was all Catholic schools and I thought, well that’s not really fair, it’s a talk for everybody, not just nationalists,” said Evan Curran from St Joseph’s College. “The main reason we’re having these conversations is so we know what we’re getting into. If there’s a united Ireland and unionists aren’t happy, or republicans aren’t happy with unionists not being happy, there’s going to be riots, even conflict, so for it to prosper it needs to be a safe environment for everyone, no matter what your background is.” “If it’s an all-inclusive conversation about a new Ireland, surely it shouldn’t all just be Catholics talking to each other? Surely unionists and Protestant schools should be also engaging in this conversation as well,” said Jayden Nixon, also from St Joseph’s. “I think it’s hard for them, because I wouldn’t really go to a talk about giving the Republic back to them [the UK],” says Dobbins. “It would be a first step, but it’s hard to take.”",0,1
2024/9/26,"National children’s hospital ‘car crash’  set to be repeated with maternity hospital, Dáil told Aontú leader claims building and fit-out tender as ‘half-baked’ as contract for children’s hospital and that Government is ‘incinerating taxpayers’ money’ The Government is heading for the same “car crash” costs in the construction of the national maternity hospital that apply to the national children’s hospital, the Dáil has been told. Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín made the claim as he highlighted the development of the maternity hospital, to be located at St Vincent’s hospital in south Dublin. Mr Tóibín said he had the bill of quantities – the tender document detailing materials, parts and labour costs – for the maternity hospital. “It appears that the Government is again rushing to tender before the job is properly designed. It also appears that the bill of quantities for the national maternity hospital is as half-baked as the contract for the national children’s hospital.” Mr Tóibín said he understood there were only two companies tendering for the “mechanical elements” of the maternity facility. “It appears that the Government is heading for the same procurement car crash for the national maternity hospital that exists for the national children’s hospital.” He called for a review of the tender process for the national maternity hospital, “given the fiasco over the national children’s hospital”. He said “the Government is incinerating taxpayers’ money”. However Tánaiste Micheál Martin said the delay with the maternity hospital was “more on the political side in terms of getting that project off the ground”. “When you delay, you increase costs,” and “we had delay, in my view, for far, far too long”. He said a report by PwC “goes into considerable detail on errors and mistakes that were made” in the national children’s hospital. But “it is ridiculous to suggest that politicians now have to oversee every bill of quantity in respect of every hospital that is going to be built”. Meanwhile, in the Seanad Independent Senator Victor Boyhan criticised members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for scapegoating the OPW over the costs of the bike shed and said they should have known. The construction “has been under our nose” for the past nine months. “We knew what was going on.” Mr Boyhan said “it is easy to romp in here after the summer and blame the OPW and everybody else. Let us as politicians take responsibility for things that are going on within our campus.” Deputy Seanad leader Seán Kyne told Mr Boyhan “we all saw the bike shed being built, yet no one, including him, queried its cost. No one imagined what the costs would be, and everybody assumed they would be reasonable.”",0,1
2024/9/27,"The Week That Was at the UN General Assembly: Jennifer Bray’s New York diary Micheal D Higgins, Simon Harris and Micheál Martin make headlines with comments on homelessness and immigration, Israel and Iran, a trip to Washington and time spent with Meryl Streep   What is usually a busy week of staid bilateral meetings and dry multilaterals was anything but for the President, Taoiseach and Tánaiste at the UN General Assembly, the annual gathering of world leaders in New York City. Tánaiste Micheál Martin rubbed shoulders with Hollywood royalty Meryl Streep, Taoiseach Simon Harris secured a diplomatic coup by bagging a second White House visit, and President Michael D Higgins reignited a controversy over his letter to the newly elected president of Iran. Green Party Minister Eamon Ryan also announced his own good news while in Manhattan, confirming that he is likely to be asked to lead talks at the upcoming UN climate negotiations in Azerbaijan. Mr Higgins normally keeps out of the headlines but he made them this week. The Taoiseach must have been breathing a sigh of relief that it wasn’t his comments on homelessness and immigration (where he linked the two) that became the story of the week – instead it was the unclear statements made by Mr Higgins about the Israeli embassy circulating his letter to the president of Iran. The Áras confirmed that the President did not send letters to Russian president Vladimir Putin or Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro on their “re-elections”. But he did, the Áras confirmed, congratulate Israeli president Yitzhak Herzog on his election in 2021. What  isn’t clear is how the President decides who to congratulate. In his second press conference in Manhattan, he was visibly angry that the media wanted to ask him, repeatedly, to clarify his comments instead of asking about the topics he was discussing in his UN meetings. Some Government officials looked like they had certainly had better days at work. Then, on Monday, Mr Martin was pictured chatting to Hollywood actor Meryl Streep. Streep introduced a short documentary on the participation of four Afghan women leaders in the Doha peace talks in 2020 before the Taliban takeover. She spoke later and said that cats have more freedom than women in Afghanistan. Asked how his engagement was with Streep, Mr Martin said it was “lovely, very nice”. “She spoke poetically and with great impact. She’s a very genuine person and she’s very committed to that issue, and I am so privileged to have met her in those circumstances,” he said. Mr Martin had a packed schedule, including meetings with Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, but he also found time to open a swish new home for the Consulate General of Ireland in New York in the iconic Met Life building. He was presented with a framed picture of his father by CIÉ Tours, which will also be based in the new Ireland House. Martin’s father was a CIÉ bus driver. He said the new location “will deepen the close and dynamic relationship Ireland has with the city of New York, the region and the United States as a whole”. By that stage, the diplomatic staff on the trip were already buzzing with the news that Ireland had secured a second outing in the Oval Office with US president Joe Biden. The invitation was issued through normal diplomatic channels in the last couple of weeks. The Taoiseach’s camp were keeping schtum on the date. But the date was of great interest to the press corps, however, given the intense general election speculation. The Irish Times sat down with Mr Harris in Fitzpatrick’s Hotel on Wednesday morning, and put it to him that he’d be back in the States in “no time”. “Yeah, two weeks,” he said, before catching himself and realising he had given the date away. Mr Harris had also popped in to an informal dinner on Sunday night, whereupon he was further peppered with questions about the election. He gave nothing away. The Irish Times did hear him categorically rule out two dates throughout the week, though: November 8th and November 15th. Now the speculation is that it will all happen very quickly.",0,1
2024/9/28,"Time, due diligence and indecision blamed for driving up costs of State infrastructure projects Amid controversy over a bike shelter and security hut, people involved in planning such projects argue that, in an era of high construction inflation, lengthy processes drive up costs  Few, if any, believe the final cost for the planned 244-bed hospital will be close to this figure. If the costs end up far higher than the “indicative” amount set out in 2013, there will undoubtedly be criticism about another State project running way over budget – just like the new national children’s hospital, the cost of which has spiralled from €650 million a decade ago to an estimated €2.2 billion, or the €336,000 Leinster House bicycle shelter and the €1.4 million Department of Finance security hut. However, academic experts and some in government who are involved in the development of new projects argue it is wrong to maintain that all State projects end up way over time and budget. They maintain that government structures for approving large projects mean there can be years between when they are first proposed and when they become operational. And in the meantime construction and other cost inflation will push up the prices. In the case of the new national maternity hospital, which was announced in 2013, Cabinet only gave its approval in 2023 for the project to proceed to tender for a main contractor. At the same time the State’s spending watchdog, the Comptroller and Auditor General, each year identifies examples of risky behaviour or wasteful expenditure. Earlier this month it sharply criticised University of Limerick over two botched property deals that resulted in combined financial losses of more than €8 million. In 2022 a comptroller’s report following the cyber attack on the health service, which cost about €100 million, found HSE computers had been only monitored for viruses during daytime hours. A new report by the comptroller on Monday may contain further criticism of public service bodies. Prof Eoin Reeves, who specialises in the economics of infrastructure at the University of Limerick, maintains the State sector has been successful in delivering some projects on time and on budget. He points to the National Development Finance Agency and the former National Roads Authority (now part of the Transport Infrastructure Ireland) and the roll-out of the motorway network. In 2019 the HSE maintained that the new national central mental hospital was on time and on budget. Reeves said that internationally there have been several examples of cost overruns in large projects. He highlighted cases such the “big dig” highway project in Boston in the United States. He said international research on mega projects suggested 90 per cent ran over budget, and in nine out of 10 of these projects the average overrun was about 28 per cent. In Ireland large projects costing more than €200 million have to go through a whole series of procedures and “decision gates” before securing final approval. Economic consultant Tom Ferris said the Government introduced new “infrastructure guidelines” earlier this year. He said for large projects there has to be an external assurance process at the strategic assessment and preliminary business case stage. This is followed by a review by the Major Projects Advisory Group of the Department of Public Expenditure at the preliminary business case stage and consideration by government at the preliminary business case and final business case stage. “Proposals must be approved at each stage,” he said. All of this is aimed at protecting exchequer resources. However, some involved in this process argue that in an era of high construction inflation, lengthy processes drive up costs. Some projects that are rejected at one point sometimes re-emerge for consideration at a later date when the costs are much higher. Former Health Service Executive chief executive Tony O’Brien has criticised “mandarins” in the Department of Public Expenditure for blocking electronic health records in hospitals. It was estimated that this project would cost about €1 billion several years ago. The Irish Times reported this month that Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was pushing for the roll-out of electronic health records across the HSE to be funded from the proceeds of the €13 billion tax bill the EU ordered US tech giant Apple to pay to the exchequer. The cost now is likely to come in at in excess of €1.5 billion.",0,1
2024/9/4,"Taoiseach Simon Harris travels to Kyiv for meeting with Zelenskiy Ireland to commit to provide further €36m in funding to organisations working in Ukraine Taoiseach Simon Harris has travelled to Kyiv to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, where he is to pledge €36 million in funding to support humanitarian organisations working in Ukraine. Russian bombing of Ukraine has intensified in recent days, with more than 40 people killed and 180 wounded in strikes on a military institute in the central town of Poltava. Kyiv and several other Ukrainian cities have also been subject to heavy bombardments, as Russia seeks to ramp up pressure during what is becoming a crucial juncture in the 2½-year conflict. During the trip Mr Harris is to announce that the Government will provide a further €36 million in aid funding to organisations working in Ukraine, as well as signing an agreement pledging ongoing support to the country over the coming years. A memo detailing the plans was approved by Cabinet during a meeting on Tuesday, in advance of Mr Harris travelling to Kyiv. Officials on Monday said that any assistance given to Ukraine would be of a non-lethal character and would not contravene the State’s neutrality. Mr Harris is to meet Mr Zelenskiy in the Ukrainian capital, where he will formally sign the agreement setting out Ireland’s future commitments to support the eastern European country. The Fine Gael leader is also expected to discuss Ukraine’s progress towards membership of the European Union during their meeting. The two leaders previously met in July this year in Shannon Airport, as Mr Zelenskiy was flying through Ireland on his way back from Washington. Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin have both visited the Ukrainian capital as taoisigh since the outbreak of the war. Mr Harris is also scheduled to meet Denys Shmyhal, the Ukrainian prime minister, as well as visiting areas heavily bombed by Russia since the invasion. Ukraine has increasingly pleaded for western allies to do more as the war rages on, more than two years after Russia invaded in February 2022. Mr Zelenskiy has appealed for more air defence systems to help Ukraine shoot down Russian missiles, and permission to strike military targets deep in Russia, such as airfields used to launch bombing raids. Last month Ukrainian forces broke through into Russian territory in a surprise advance in Kursk, which Russia has since been trying to repel. At the same time Russia has been making steady advances in eastern Ukraine, as part of a push to take control of Pokrovsk, a logistical hub seen as a strategic city in the conflict in the Donbas region. In a statement at the start of the trip, Mr Harris said Russian missile attacks on Poltava this week were a “grim and horrific reminder” of the threat Ukraine was facing every day. He said he was pleased to be in Ukraine to hear “first hand” from Mr Zelenskiy what the situation was like on the ground. The agreement on Ireland’s future support made it clear it would “stand with the brave people of Ukraine for as long as it takes”, he said.",0,1
2024/9/4,"Senator and former TD Shane Cassells bows out of politics Meath FF politician ‘done with public life’, leaving way clear for Cllr Aisling Dempsey, daughter of former minister Fianna Fáil senator Shane Cassells has said his decision to retire from politics came because he felt he had nothing more to contribute after spending 25 years in public life. The 46-year-old Meath politician said he has been involved in politics as a councillor, Senator and TD since the age of 21. He will continue in the Seanad until the next general election, which must take place by March 2025, but will not contest it. “I have done 16 years as a councillor and nine years in the Oireachtas as a TD and Senator,” he said. “I’m out of public life now. I’ve really enjoyed it. It has been a privilege. But I’m done with public life.” Mr Cassells was expected to seek a nomination to stand the Meath West constituency in the general election to try to regain the seat he won in 2016 but lost in 2020. The other prominent candidate seeking a nomination for this week’s convention was Cllr Aisling Dempsey, the daughter of former TD and minister Noel Dempsey. Mr Cassells said  he had arrived at the decision some time ago and it was not prompted by any pressure or extenuating circumstances. In a statement, party leader and Tánaiste Micheál Martin said Mr Cassells had done “a lot for his county and town of Navan”. “I spoke to Shane and I have a lot of respect and admiration for Shane’s work over the years, but I fully understand his reasons for wanting to move on to a new chapter in his life.” The convention for Meath West will be held on Thursday. The party has not said if it will be pursuing a one-candidate, or two-candidate strategy in the three-seat constituency. The current TDs are Johnny Brady (Sinn Féin); Peadar Tóibín (Aontú) and Damien English (Fine Gael). The constituency remained a three-seater after the latest boundary changes.. Some parts of Westmeath which were formerly in the constituency have now moved back to Longford-Westmeath. Ms Dempsey, who is based in Trim, was comfortably reelected to Meath County Council in the June elections.",0,1
2024/9/5,"Government to make last minute lobbying push for EU commissioner job Taoiseach Simon Harris due to discuss commissioner posts with Ursula von der Leyen this week The Government is to make a final push this week to try to secure as high profile an EU commissioner role as possible for former finance minister Michael McGrath. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is expected to speak to Taoiseach Simon Harris on the phone in the coming days, where the Fine Gael leader will make the case for Mr McGrath in the  distribution of jobs at the top of the powerful EU institution. Ms von der Leyen is currently choosing which portfolios to assign to prospective commissioners nominated by each EU country, with a decision expected by the middle of next week. Ireland has nominated Mr McGrath as its next EU commissioner, with the Government stating that it was seeking to secure a finance-related job for the Fianna Fáil politician. Speaking in Poland on Thursday, Mr Harris confirmed he was due to discuss the commissioner roles with Ms von der Leyen this week. “This would be normal in advance of the commission being formed, that the president would reach out to heads of government and I look forward to that opportunity,” he said. Mr Harris said he would be making the case that Mr McGrath was a competent candidate who had high level experience in Government. “Ireland has nominated a person of substance, a person with political experience, a person who has served as a finance minister,” he said. “To be honest, jobs and who gets what is interesting on one level, it’s not unimportant. But the most important issue is that the new commission hits the ground running. There are real issues facing Europe, the world, and we need a competent top team in place to get on with it,” Mr Harris said. The Taoiseach said he was confident Ms von der Leyen would put together the “best team” of commissioners. “Whatever portfolio Michael McGrath ends up with I know he will play a very real and significant role in the commission,” he said. A number of factors are believed to be working against Mr McGrath being given a prominent finance-related commissioner role. The Government ignored a request from Ms von der Leyen for countries to propose two names, with at least one being a woman, so she could put together a gender-balanced team of commissioners. Fianna Fáil’s four MEPs also voted against the German politician in a European Parliament vote that confirmed her reappointment as president of the EU’s executive arm for another five years. As one of the first countries to formally nominate its candidate for commissioner, the Government did not consult the commission president beforehand about who they planned to put forward, which it is believed caused annoyance. Ms von der Leyen has been meeting prospective commissioners for one on one interviews over the past fortnight, with her meeting with Mr McGrath taking place early last week. Mr Harris rejected any suggestion Ireland’s relationship with Ms von der Leyen had frayed in recent months. “I have a very good relationship with president von der Leyen, we’re both from the same European political party. I know Ursula, she is an excellent president of the commission,” he said. The Fine Gael leader was speaking in the city of Rzeszów, Poland, where he met Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, after returning from an official visit to Ukraine. Speaking to journalists afterwards, Mr Tusk said he hoped Ireland would back proposals for the EU to fund a European air defence shield, aimed at protecting the east of the bloc from future threats posed by Russia.",0,1
2024/9/5,"Schools abuse redress: Concern in Government over costs running into billions Taoiseach suggests redress for abused in religious-run schools cannot be ‘parked’ until after inquiry, but no decision yet on scheme A redress scheme for victims of sexual abuse in schools cannot wait until a full inquiry is completed, the Taoiseach Simon Harris said yesterday, suggesting an acceleration of compensation proposals which have not yet been agreed by Government. While there is general agreement in Government that a redress scheme for victims will be necessary, there is growing concern at the potential costs which some senior figures fear could run into the billions. Senior sources pointed out that the Government has not decided on a redress scheme and a senior officials group will have to make recommendations on the Commission of Investigation before any plan for compensating victims is agreed. But the Taoiseach’s comments suggested impatience with a more cautious approach when he told reporters in Kyiv, Ukraine, that compensation for those abused in religious-run schools could not be “parked” until after a full statutory inquiry into the abuse was completed. Resolving the question of how to offer redress to victims of abuse could not wait until the end of the coming Commission of Investigation process, he said. “We’ve got to be honest from the start, if we don’t get this right in terms of how we structure it, then we have something that runs for years and years and years without answers and I know that’s the last thing the survivors want,” he said. Survivors had been expressing their desire for a process that found “truth and justice”, in a more efficient manner than previous statutory inquiries, he said. “People can’t wait five, six, seven years, longer,” he said. Mr Harris said religious orders who ran the schools now had to “step up” when it came to redress. “I welcome statements of regret and sorrow, and I don’t doubt the bone fides of any order, it is better to have those statements. They will be hollow words if they are just statements saying we’re sorry,” he said. The record of religious orders contributing to State compensation schemes in the past had been “underwhelming” to put it politely, Mr Harris said. But there is growing worry in Government about the potential costs of any redress scheme and a concern that the scale of any potential liability should be evaluated before a decision to proceed is made. Several senior Coalition sources, all speaking on condition of anonymity because, they said, of the sensitivity of the subject, attested to the concerns at the highest official and political levels. One senior figure said that the costs of a redress scheme were “impossible to comprehend” but that the Government “can’t say no”. “I’m not saying it’s wrong, just that it’s impossible to limit now,” said another source, describing it as a “very substantial contingent liability” that had now been added to the State’s balance sheet. One person previously briefed on the issue estimated that the total costs of the inquiry that the Government has promised, and any subsequent redress scheme, could exceed €5 billion. Other sources however noted that there had been no Government decision on a redress scheme — just one to establish a high-level group to make recommendations on the next steps. The Coalition has committed to a statutory inquiry into the abuse, which is likely, said sources to include all schools rather than just those run by religious orders. All sources referred to the costs of previous redress schemes. In the case of the scheme to compensate victims of abuse in residential institutions, the estimated cost of €250 million rose to €1.245 billion, plus some €200 million in legal costs. Religious orders contributed less than €250 million in total. Last night the Garda appealed to any victims or witnesses to historic sexual abuse crimes to contact them.",0,1
2024/9/5,"‘People are open to us again’: Labour strategises on how to turn optimism into votes Party’s first call after election will be to Greens and Soc Dems – but it needs to secure seats for that to matter “Considering our starting point and general polling, I feel better going into this than I thought I would,” says Labour’s Fingal TD Duncan Smith on the eve of the party’s think-in. Labour gathers today for the annual event, held by parties to mark the start of the political year, fine tune strategy and press home key messages – this time, on the verge of a general election. “People are open to us again. I don’t necessarily know does that mean they will definitely punt for us,” says Limerick councillor and general election candidate Conor Sheehan. Even discounting pre-season boosterism, there are grounds for guarded optimism, at least relative to recent years, which saw the party on the precipice of electoral oblivion. The local and European elections saw Labour hold its own on councils, and it hopes Aódhan Ó Ríordáin’s success in the Dublin MEP race could be a watershed. Party figures point to an ability to build campaigns for Ó Ríordáin and Ivana Bacik, to “create a narrative and transmit that to the electorate”. That said, both had national profile, whereas in the general election, it will defend three of seven seats without incumbents. In Wexford, George Lawlor has retained former leader Brendan Howlin’s base of Wexford town. Optimists say the retiring Sean Sherlock’s Cork East seat could be effectively retained albeit in Cork North Central, if it can get out the vote on the north side of the city and alloy it with Sherlock’s transplanted Mallow base. In Ó Ríordáin’s old Dublin Bay North constituency, the party is known to have unsuccessfully cast around for a high-profile replacement, seeking figures from the sporting world and further afield. Shane Folan, twice unsuccessful in local contests, is the likely candidate. It is hard to see the party retaining all three – in truth, one is a more likely outcome, with other incumbents also in a battle. When it comes to new blood, insiders tip prospects like Laura Harmon in Cork South Central, Rob O’Donoghue in Fingal West and Ciarán Ahern in Dublin South West among a dozen or so constituencies where Labour believes it is in the running. The most optimistic view is that the party could return 10-12 TDs. But the most pessimistic private take – in a party always capable of dour self-assessment – was as low as two deputies, with sources sketching out a scenario where Labour struggles to attract attention as Sinn Féin soaks up space as the main opposition force and smaller parties fight for crumbs from the table. “It’s much more crowded and much more difficult to carve out why people should vote Labour,” concedes Ó Ríordáin, who argues the party must be “steadfast in our belief system” to capture votes. Bacik’s elevation to leader following a putsch against Alan Kelly in 2021 was dramatic, but there are concerns within the parliamentary party that she is yet to put an authoritative stamp on Labour and to stake out ground for the party. She is now longer in the post than the leaders of Fine Gael, the Green Party and the Social Democrats, but one party figure believes that even Bacik “struggles to know what Project Ivana is”, criticising her for having “no proper vision”. Others say she retains support in the party but has spread herself too thin, struggling to define herself as other than a “D4 liberal lawyer” for voters. There is also a view among some that Labour needs to be more forthright about co-ordinating with other parties of the centre left – namely the Greens and the Social Democrats. Ó Ríordáin says these parties should not be “spending all our time trying to convince the electorate there’s a massive difference [between them]”. After the election, he says Labour’s first phone call will be to the Greens and Social Democrats, before wider government formation talks take place. Whether there is anything to discuss is in the balance.",0,1
2024/9/6,"SDLP endorses Claire Hanna to succeed Colum Eastwood as party leader Connemara-born South Belfast MP (44) was sole candidate for role and will be ratified at party’s annual conference in October South Belfast MP Claire Hanna has been endorsed by the SDLP to succeed Colum Eastwood as the next party leader after nominations for the role closed on Friday. The 44-year-old Connemara-born politician was the sole candidate and will be ratified at the party’s annual conference on October 5th. In a statement, the SDLP said Ms Hanna had received the nominations of every eligible party constituency branch and support group. The news comes a week after Mr Eastwood confirmed his resignation, saying it was time for him to “step aside” after nine years as leader. He will continue his work as MP for Foyle. As he announced his departure, he backed Ms Hanna to replace him, describing her as “far and away the best option”. The party’s former Brexit spokesperson, Ms Hanna’s family is steeped in SDLP history. Her mother, Carmel, was a long-standing MLA, who served briefly as a Stormont minister, while her father, Eamon, is a former general secretary of the party. The family moved to south Belfast when Ms Hanna was three-years-old. Regarded as one of the SDLP’s most capable representatives, Ms Hanna had a career in international development before entering politics and travelled to Haiti, Zambia and Bangladesh through her work in policy and education posts. First elected to Belfast City Council in 2011 for the Balmoral ward, she was co-opted on to the Northern Ireland Assembly as an MLA, and re-elected in 2016 and 2018 until her landslide Westminster election victory in 2019, when she ousted DUP incumbent Emma Little-Pengelly, now Stormont’s Deputy First Minister. Ms Hanna was re-elected to the South Belfast seat in July with a majority of more than 12,000, holding off the centrist Alliance vote, despite the SDLP’s sharp electoral decline. The party was once the dominant force within nationalist politics in Northern Ireland, but has fewer MPs, MLAs and councillors now than a decade ago and is fifth in the Assembly line-up. She sits on the Northern Ireland Affairs scrutiny committee in Westminster and is the SDLP’s spokesperson for Europe and International Affairs. In 2019, Ms Hanna resigned the party whip over proposals for a partnership with Fianna Fáil and she recently revealed in a BBC interview that the plan made her consider quitting. Party insiders say that since announcing her intention to run for leader, there has been a “bounce” among grassroots members. “People seem to be uplifted by her and there’s a sense of relief at the change,” said one. Former SDLP vice-chair Tom Kelly described Ms Hanna as a “pretty charismatic politician”. “Colum is a very accomplished public speaker but when you’re charismatic, you carry that with you all the time,” he said. “It’s a wee bit like Leo Varadkar, who is a brilliant performer when the lights go on. “Claire also seems to enjoy engagement. While the first rule of being a leader is likeability, you must also have the ability to engage with people. She has that fearlessness about going in – if she leaves you and you don’t even agree with her, you won’t disagree.” Mr Kelly said by that by beginning her political career at councillor level, she had “learned all the rules”. “She has politics and the SDLP in her DNA but took the more difficult route of going into local government to cut her teeth at grassroots – when she could have easily gone in as an MLA. But that was the correct career path for a politician.” Last week Ms Hanna admitted that taking on the leadership job was daunting. “I’m not someone who thinks they have all the answers ... but I have been involved in the SDLP for many, many years and I have learned a thing or two about the things that work in terms of organising people and in terms of motivating,” she said. “I’m looking forward to getting stuck in if that’s what the members decide.”",0,1
2024/9/6,"Gráinne Seoige set to become Fianna Fáil general election candidate after three nominees pull out of race Broadcaster is second ‘celebrity’ candidate connected to party’s campaign along with former TV news anchor Alison Comyn TV broadcaster Gráinne Seoige will automatically become a Fianna Fáil candidate in the next general election after three nominees pulled out of the race on Friday hours before the Galway West selection convention. Ms Seoige now becomes the second “celebrity” candidate to be connected with Fianna Fáil’s general election campaign. The party announced that another former TV news anchor, Alison Comyn, would be a candidate for the party in Louth alongside Senator Erin McGreehan. A Fianna Fáil spokeswoman confirmed that three potential candidates – Senator Ollie Crowe, Galway city councillor Alan Cheevers and Connemara candidate Darragh Ó Tuairisg – had withdrawn their nominations by Friday evening. This left only Ms Seoige and Galway city councillor John Connolly in the race. With the party pursuing a strategy of running at least two candidates in the five-seat constituency, both are expected to be ratified by the convention on Friday evening.  In a statement on Friday evening, Ms Seoige said: “It is with a sense of pride and belonging that I stand ready to work hard for everyone in this constituency.” She paid tribute to outgoing Fianna Fáil TD Éamon Ó Cuív, saying: “His dedication and achievements have left a lasting impact on Galway and I’m deeply honoured to potentially be in the position to build on the strong foundations he has laid.” For his part, Mr Connolly, who contested a general election in 2016, said he was delighted to be a candidate again. “I was first elected in 2004 to the city council and I am now ambitious to do it on a grander scale. I have a lot of hunger for this at the moment.” Mr Connolly said that he wanted to spread his campaign as far and as wide across the constituency as he could with the objective of “maximising the party vote and hopefully winning two seats”. Fianna Fáil is also holding a convention in Mayo on Friday evening where outgoing TD and Minister of State Dara Calleary and Senator Lisa Chambers will be nominated. Ms Chambers lost her Dáil seat in 2020 but with the constituency having increased to five seats the party will target a gain here. Earlier this week, the party selected former lord mayor of Dublin Tom Brabazon as its candidate in the five-seat constituency of Dublin Bay North. Its sitting Fianna Fáil TD Seán Haughey announced earlier this year that he will be retiring at the time of the next election. Mr Brabazon has been a councillor since 2003. The Fine Gael convention for Galway East on Saturday evening is expected to be closely contested. The outgoing Deputy for Fine Gael, Ciarán Cannon, said earlier this year he would not be seeking re-election. Six nominees in all will be seeking one or two nominations. The front-runner is expected to be Cllr Peter Roche from Abbeyknockmoy, who got almost 6,000 first preferences in the 2020 election. The other candidates are Kabir Ahmmed; Galway city councillor Clodagh Higgins: Siobhán Lawless, Niamh Madden; and Shane Dolphin. At a convention on Thursday night, Senator John McGahon and Cllr Paula Butterly were selected to represent the party in Louth. On the same night, veteran Fine Gael politician Willie Aird (64) was selected for Laois. He has been a councillor for 45 years, having been first elected in 1979. Senator Mary Seery-Kearney was also chosen by Fine Gael for Dublin South Central on Thursday.",0,1
2024/9/6,"Would a new Department of Infrastructure proposed by Simon Harris work? Experts are not so sure Two external advisory groups recommended a similar idea but as a new unit within the Department of Public Expenditure rather than as a separate government department  On Wednesday the head of the Dublin Airport Authority publicly backed a proposal by Taoiseach Simon Harris to set up a new Government Department of Infrastructure. Kenny Jacobs suggested that the State needed faster planning and “joined-up thinking” regarding the development of infrastructure. Harris has argued that it made no sense to have five or six departments involved in the delivery of one project. “I believe all this capital spending should be done by the best planners, procurers and protectors of the public interest under one roof,” he wrote in the Business Post last weekend. Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe last month said the Fine Gael election manifesto would contain proposals for such a new department. Some experts in politics and infrastructural developments are not so sure about the whole concept. Harris first floated the proposal in July, though the general idea is not exactly new. In 2017 the National Economic and Social Council (NESC), which advises the Government on policy, and a “public investment management assessment” (Pima) carried out by the International Monetary Fund set out reform proposals for infrastructural projects. Both essentially suggested the establishment of a new body, though critically not a stand-alone government department but rather a unit inside the existing Department of Public Expenditure. The Pima report recommended an “infrastructure projects unit” within the department overseeing spending “to provide advisory services to the Minister on appraisal and selection of projects, and to carry out studies of infrastructure bottlenecks, financing and evaluation of lessons learned”. NESC proposed an Infrastructure Policy Centre, which would provide expertise on infrastructure policy and investment. It would be based in the Department of Public Expenditure, but would also report to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance. It suggested it would have three roles: financing and funding, development projects, and longer-term vision and strategy. Donohoe said that changing the shape of Government may be necessary to deliver various large-scale projects that will be coming through the planning process at the same time during the term of the next government. These include the Dublin metro, the offshore wind farms, the long-awaited Cork-Limerick motorway and the water pipeline from the Shannon to Dublin. “I think the challenge with this would be defining what is really important infrastructure and what isn’t,” Donohoe told reporters last month when asked about the idea. “The metro, which is a project that the Department of Transport would be aiming to deliver, is a huge project. But if you were to move a project like that now away from the Department of Transport, or away from the National Transport Authority, it could make it far harder to do.” Despite the challenges, the spending Minister said he backed the idea. “It’s an idea that I certainly support and we will look at how that would work in the coming weeks and months,” he said. Prof Eoin Reeves, an expert on infrastructure development at the Department of Economics at the University of Limerick, welcomed the debate on the Taoiseach’s proposal, but was not sure it would address challenges in delivering big projects posed by labour shortages, planning issues and an economy that is at full capacity. “In the absence of knowing the details of how exactly it would all work out, I would have concerns about the workability of it,” he said. “We have bodies and agencies responsible for infrastructure at all sorts of levels of government and in local government. I am not sure how that would all be rolled into one department.” “I can’t see how it could work that smoothly. It is a proposal that is worth talking about.” He pointed out how it had been considered in recent years – by NESC and the Pima report – and that “was not the position that was put forward,” he said. Gary Murphy, professor of politics at Dublin City University, is sceptical about the idea and has concerns that the new department could lead to internal wrangling and tensions due to the power concentrated within it. He suggested it could exacerbate tensions within a coalition government or lead to power struggles within the Civil Service. He pointed to another big political idea of nearly 50 years ago: the establishment of the Department of Economic Planning in 1977. The move was completely resisted by the Department of Finance, said Prof Murphy, and by the time Charles Haughey abolished the department in 1980, it “had become a busted flush”.",0,1
2024/9/6,"Inheritance tax threshold rises have no ‘clear policy rationale’, watchdog says Recent increases to thresholds appear ‘arbitrary’ and not to follow ‘clear and consistent principles’, Parliamentary Budget Office says Increases to inheritance tax thresholds over the past decade have had the appearance of being “arbitrary and without any clear policy rationale,” the Parliamentary Budget Office has said in a briefing document on the country’s existing tax base. It suggested that while a case might be made for linking changes to inflation, the four increases introduced since 2013 have ranged from 3.2 per cent to 24 per cent and that variation, combined with the infrequency of the changes, leaves the Government’s approach to the issue appearing not to follow “clear and consistent principles”. In a briefing document intended to outline the potential impacts of changes to taxation in the forthcoming budget, the office, which aims to provide “independent and impartial information, analysis and advice to the Houses of the Oireachtas” acknowledged index linking could “assist in preserving the purchasing power associated with capital acquisitions”. It argued, however, that the justification for recent increases had not been made clear and that the Commission on Taxation recommended two years ago thresholds for immediate family members, currently set at €335,000, be “substantially reduced” given the need to significantly broaden the tax base. The Minister for Finance, Jack Chambers, has said the “consensus within Government” is that the threshold is too low, however, and that he is working on options to change it in the forthcoming budget, but that no decisions have been taken. In its document, An Overview of Taxes on Wealth in Ireland, published this week, the PBO highlighted the commission’s warning with regard to the State’s growing reliance on corporation and income taxes. The report said “income and corporation tax receipts are highly concentrated on a small number of taxpayers. This remains an ongoing concern and poses a risk to the public finances.” It said: “In 2023, 79 per cent of income tax receipts were paid by the top 20 per cent of income earners; while 52 per cent of corporation receipts were paid by just 10 companies. The concentration of the tax base poses a significant risk to the State and its ability to fund growing levels of public expenditure.” It was also critical of the limited availability of the sort of up-to-date information required to properly consider policy options. “Understanding the distributional impact of policy changes related to taxes on wealth on different groups in society is hindered by the lack of timely and detailed administrative data,” it said. Overall, it pointed to large increases in the amount of tax revenue being collected by the Government, with the total increasing from €38 billion in 2013 to €88 billion in 2023. It said the proportion of this total accounted for by income and corporation taxes combined has increased from 49 per cent to 62 per cent. Net Irish household wealth at the end of 2023 was €1,112.6 billion, it said, compared with €465.9 billion a decade earlier, with the increase of 139 per cent in nominal terms far greater than that recorded in relation to inflation or wages. Housing continues to account for about two-thirds of this wealth, it said. About 2 per cent of tax revenue was generated by capital acquisitions tax, which includes inheritance tax, and capital gains tax last year. When other taxes on wealth are included, the total remains “relatively low, at €4.9 billion in 2023″ it said.  It acknowledged that many of those required to pay increased taxes on property and wealth would already be paying higher amounts of tax on earnings and that the overall competitiveness of the economy needed to be considered and so it said “additional base-broadening measures should be considered by government”. “As the value of assets and household wealth held in Ireland grows, it is important that the State adequately and fairly taxes wealth to avoid and correct market distortions, and to broaden the tax base,” it said.",0,1
2024/9/7,"Labour fails to land high-profile candidates to join party’s general election ticket Former Dublin footballer Philly McMahon and Dr Rhona Mahony among those contacted The Labour Party has failed to land a number of high-profile individuals from the worlds of sport, medicine and politics that it had targeted for its general election ticket. With an election widely expected to take place before the end of the year, The Irish Times has learned that Labour made an informal approach sounding out eight time All-Ireland winning former Dublin footballer Philly McMahon about whether he would be interested in running for the Dáil. A similar approach is understood to have been made to Dr Rhona Mahony, the former master of the National Maternity Hospital. Former Fianna Fáil and Independent senator Averil Power, now chief executive of the Irish Cancer Society, confirmed she had been approached by the party. “I was approached out of the blue by the Labour Party and said no. I told them I appreciated the offer but have no intention of going back into politics,” Ms Power said. Mr McMahon and Dr Mahony said they had no comment when contacted. Party sources said the expectation was that if any of the high-profile individuals were agreeable, they would have been chosen to run in Dublin Bay North. Labour will be seeking to retain a seat in the constituency vacated as a result of Aodhán Ó Ríordáin’s election to the European Parliament earlier this year. It is understood that talks did not progress, the individuals approached did not seriously consider entering politics and that things were never formalised to the extent that meetings were held with Labour leader Ivana Bacik TD. The party held seven Dáil seats going into the local and European elections. However, with Mr Ó Ríordáin now an MEP and former leader and Wexford TD Brendan Howlin and Cork East TD Seán Sherlock opting not to run for the Dáil again, Labour will be defending almost half of its seats without the benefit of having an incumbent candidate. Speaking this week at a party meeting held before the beginning of the Dáil term, Ms Bacik said 16 candidates had already been selected to run for the party, which she said had been buoyed by the results of the local and European elections in June. However, she did not put a figure on how many seats Labour expected to win in a general election, other than to say she wanted to return with more than it has. Party sources said last week that Labour expected to be in the running in about a dozen constituencies, although others believe the party could struggle to retain its current level of representation in the Dáil. Ms Bacik said Labour would not be involved in a vote-transfer agreement with any other party before the general election, but that it would be open to engaging afterwards with parties and individual TDs “who share our vision, our centre-left and social democratic values”. A spokeswoman for the Labour Party said: “Like any political party, Labour has been seeking to recruit and select candidates for the upcoming general election and will be making announcements in the coming weeks.”",0,1
2024/9/7,"A €336,000 bike shelter: Breaking the cycle of overspending on public projects Former OPW manager, who examined excessive spending, believes a type of commercial semi-State body could better manage properties When Allen Morgan went public about waste in the public sector, he was hoping the political establishment might sit up and take notice. He had been working in the Office of Public Works (OPW) for 37 years, close to four decades during which he had seen a litany of questionable spending and ill-considered property deals. Shortly before his retirement in 2017, Mr Morgan, then a senior valuer, prepared an internal report with a colleague which they called the “five case review”. It was an examination of five property deals the OPW, which is essentially the State’s property manager, had been involved in, none of which had turned out well for the Irish taxpayer. He went public about it on an RTÉ Investigates programme in 2021. It generated headlines for a few days and questions were asked by the Public Accounts Committee but, like most stories, it quickly faded from memory. Three years later, Allen Morgan looks on with a wry eye as the spotlight lands squarely on the OPW once more. The renewed interest is not down to any of the questionable land deals or property purchases Mr Morgan could highlight, some of which involved millions of euros. It was down to the construction of a €335,000 bike shelter at Leinster House, as first revealed in The Irish Times last weekend. The story was picked up by the Guardian and the BBC. Sinn Féin used it in social media attacks on the Government. A review was quickly ordered by Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW Kieran O’Donnell. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said he was “shocked”. Even Taoiseach Simon Harris managed to find time in a busy schedule that took him to Ukraine this week to say the costs were “inexplicable and inexcusable”. For its part, the OPW defended the spending on the bicycle  shelter, saying it was “procured via a framework agreement and complies with public procurement and planning guidelines”. The office added that it “recognises the importance of ensuring that public money is spent transparently”. Mr Morgan said the bike shelter story was a “microcosm” of what he had been trying to bring into the open. “People see the €335,000 as the value of a house and that really rings home,” he said, “they know you could get 20 bike sheds for that price. “And it was the same with the famous printer that didn’t fit into Leinster House. It’s often that type of thing that gets attention, it’s not always the bigger things. “Sometimes, huge figures can be flashing around, and it seems like nobody cares. But whatever it does cost, it seems almost an irrelevance to the OPW – it’s not value-for-money driven, and it’s been the same with many projects. “Does it count as incompetence or a lack of caring? Ultimately, the OPW know they can always spend more money to sort it out.” Mr Morgan’s five-case review examined five specific deals, each a catalogue of poor decisions and waste. There was the €5.5 million paid for eight old apartments beside the National Gallery in Dublin, which included a fee payment of €550,000. There was the disastrous purchase of agricultural land at Thornton Hall in north Dublin for a “super-prison” at a “grossly excessive” price of almost €30 million. The property was most recently valued at €6.5 million. “We were just asked for examples,” Mr Morgan said. “We didn’t think there was much point in giving 20 and we certainly could have.” The issues were long standing. In 2004 the OPW estimated the cost of a flood relief scheme in Co Kilkenny would be €13 million. By the time costs had risen to €48 million, the then comptroller and auditor general John Purcell said the figures involved seemed to be a “movable feast”. Fianna Fáil TD John McGuinness remembers it well describing it at the time as “beyond belief”. He said when the Kilkenny scheme in his constituency first came on the radar, there had been talk it might cost as little as €4 million or €5 million. The project is still often referenced as a “how not to do something” guide by some politicians and public servants. As a member and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Mr McGuinness said he had seen so many reports on ill-judged public spending that “you wouldn’t fit them all in Leinster House”. “Every successive government has ignored any serious reform of how money is spent in the public sector,” he said. “We have this bicycle shed [on one hand] and the children’s hospital at the other extreme, and nothing much ever seems to change.” Mr McGuinness said any company that took the approach of public bodies like the OPW would not remain in business very long. “They don’t seem to have any interest in putting in a system that prevents at least some of this,” he said. The issues highlighted by Mr Morgan continued after his retirement. A “mismeasurement” of office space at Miesian Plaza, the Baggot Street building that is now home to the Department of Health, created a €10 million overpayment for rent. A compromise deal was later agreed between the OPW and the landlord. Two years ago An Garda Síochána moved into a newly constructed €86.6 million command centre in Kilmainham in Dublin. By the time they took up residence, the building was already too small to fit all who were supposed to move. Earlier this year, planning permission was granted for a new family court complex to be built on a long-empty site at Hammond Lane beside the Four Courts in Dublin. Ballooning construction costs have seen the project significantly scaled back and the prime piece of land will never be developed to its full potential. “When the budget was chopped, they reduced the size of the building. Now, most of the opportunity of that site is gone,” said Mr Morgan. “We need to be building it in such a way that we can come back and better use that land.” Mr Morgan said it had been the same situation with the new Garda building in Kilmainham, the site for which was always a “suboptimal” choice. “It was never a chosen site; it wasn’t a candidate at first. We were looking at sites of 10 acres and upwards, albeit slightly more remote [from the city centre],” he said. “The idea [of that] was that you would have space to build as and when extra needs arose. Every bad decision like that involves more money, more cost, more planning and more time.” In late July Allen Morgan gave his views on another OPW entanglement. This time, it was the site of the National Concert Hall and plans for a new children’s science museum in Dublin. RTÉ Prime Time reported on how the OPW had been left exposed to an enormous compensation payment if it backed out of the project. Legal opinion concluded that “in theory” the arbitrator should award the children’s museum the costs of constructing the museum “which may be as high as €26 million”. The OPW has now been left with no choice but to proceed with the project irrespective of whether it remains good value or is in the right location. “It’s in the same realms of overspending again – I was shown a copy of that legal opinion, and I just remember wondering how did we get here, how did it come to be like that?” said Mr Morgan. “The cost of the project for the children’s museum is sitting at the moment at an estimated €70 million, and it could easily end up €100 million. “I don’t know how to solve it.” The retired valuer has pointed to models in other countries where a different type of agency – akin to a commercial semi-State – might take over property management on behalf of the State. “I really don’t know how you fix it,” he said. “I have always said perhaps you could go to a system where you have a semi-autonomous body with specialists rather than generalists.” He dismissed the recent proposal by Simon Harris to establish a new department of infrastructure that would take the lead on delivering capital projects. “A department of infrastructure is just moving civil servants around into a different formation,” he said. For Mr McGuinness, a long political life spent poring over public expenditure and waste has convinced him of one thing: “It will happen again.” “We will hear about the next pot of money, then the caravan moves on and we are right back with the same problems next year,” he said.",0,1
2024/9/7,"Taoiseach and Keir Starmer agree to recommence annual summits in ‘reset’ of Anglo-Irish relations  British prime minister says relationship with Ireland is hugely important after talks at Farmleigh Taoiseach Simon Harris and British prime minister Keir Starmer today agreed to restart a series of annual summits next March, with both men hailing a “reset” in relations between Ireland and the UK after the public divisions of the Brexit era. The taoiseach welcomed the British prime minister to Farmleigh House in Dublin today, where the two men had a working lunch before meeting a number of business leaders. They departed Farmleigh at 4pm to attend the Ireland-England football match at Lansdowne Road. Mr Harris welcomed Mr Starmer on the steps of the mansion earlier this morning, the two leaders walked in the gardens of Farmleigh for a number of photo opportunities. They met nine-year old Freddie Munnelly from Castleknock in Dublin and his family, who has received two liver transplants in London. They received Ireland and England scarves from the Munnelly family and exchanged Ireland and England football jerseys. Later, sitting in the library at the State guest house, Mr Harris welcomed “Dear Keir” and said they had the opportunity to “really place British and Irish relations on a new path”. He said that the two men would “flesh out what a reset looks like”. Mr Starmer also pointed to a “moment of reset” and said they would “put meaning behind those words”. He pointed to the two governments’ “joint role” in implementing the Belfast Agreement and to the similar positions on Ukraine and Gaza, where he said both governments wanted to see an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages and the transfer of aid to Gaza “so we can step down the path towards a two-state solution”. He said the fact that this was their second meeting, when he was only eight or nine weeks in office, showed the determination of both governments to improve relations. After a working lunch, the two leaders hosted a round table for business figures, including Ibec’s Danny McCoy, AIB chief Colin Hunt and Caroline Keeling from Keelings. Addressing the group, Mr Starmer said there was a strong foundation of trade and shared economic interests. Mr Starmer said economic growth was his “number one priority” as prime minister, and that his Government would make “difficult, tough decisions very early on” to stabilise the British economy. He said that the relationship with Ireland was “hugely important” to him . . . “This has always mattered to me,” he said. Mr Starmer appealed to the business leaders present to be “very frank” which he said would “help us to reset this relationship”. The leaders did not hold a press conference after their meeting, but issued a joint statement in which they said they agreed an “ambitious reset of the UK-Ireland relationship.” They also covered the UK’s intention to reset its relationship with the EU and discussed “urgent global issues, including the situation in Ukraine and in Gaza”, the statement said. They agreed to begin a series of annual summits next March, which they said would focus on four areas: security and global issues; climate, energy and technology; growth, trade and investment; culture, education and “people to people connections”. Today’s meeting, they said, “marked the start of an ambitious programme of work to be taken forward by Ministers and their departments to deliver a renewed and strengthened partnership.” Later officials said the two men had discussed a range of issues, including how disinformation online had been a spark for riots in Dublin last year, and recently in Belfast and elsewhere in the UK. There was a brief discussion on the Casement Park project in Belfast but no conclusions reached. There was no substantive discussion of the replacement of the controversial Northern Ireland Legacy Act, though the Irish side remains content that the Act will be replaced, and remains committed to dropping the legal action taken by the Irish Government over the act in the European Court of Human Rights.",0,1
2024/9/7,"No prospect of Israeli ambassador returning to Ireland unless relations improve, says embassy Ambassador Dana Erlich has remained in Israel since May when she was recalled in protest over Ireland’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine Israel’s ambassador to Ireland will not return until relations between the two states improve substantially, the country’s embassy in Dublin has said. Dana Erlich was recalled by her government “for consultations” on May 22nd, immediately after the Irish Government announced its decision to recognise the state of Palestine. The ambassador was recalled as part of a diplomatic protest against Ireland’s decision, which Israel’s foreign affairs minister Israel Katz called a reward for terrorism and “an injustice” to the memory of the victims of the October 7th terrorist attacks by Hamas. More than 1,100 Israelis, most of whom were civilians, were killed in the attacks. A spokesman for Israel’s embassy in Dublin on Friday signalled there were no plans for Ms Erlich’s return unless Ireland changed its approach towards Israel and Palestine. He said since Ms Erlich was recalled, “we have witnessed Irish Government positions and statements which we find to be unfriendly and not in the spirit of bilateral co-operation”. “We do hope that under different, more friendly conditions, ambassador Erlich will resume her duties in Dublin and continue the important work ahead of her,” he added. The embassy said consultations with Ms Erlich were continuing. She remains Israel’s ambassador to Ireland and has continued to criticise the Irish position from Jerusalem. Israel recalled the country’s ambassador from Norway and threatened to recall its ambassador from Spain after both countries announced recognition of Palestine. The ambassador to Norway has not yet returned to their post. Ms Erlich’s continued absence is seen by Irish officials as a way of continuing a diplomatic protest against Ireland’s position while stopping short of suspending diplomatic relations entirely. Relations between Ireland and Israel have been strained since shortly after the start of the war in Gaza, which has claimed more than 40,000 lives, the majority of them civilian, according to the Gaza health ministry. Ireland has been stronger than most EU countries in its condemnation of civilian deaths and in February demanded a review of the EU’s trade deal with Israel, which is conditional on respect for human rights. In March Ireland decided to join a case taken by South Africa in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) asking if Israel’s actions constitute genocide. Tánaiste Micheál Martin last month said Ireland would no longer award contracts for military goods to Israeli arms companies. Taoiseach Simon Harris has also requested fresh legal advice from the Attorney General on the validity of the EU trade deal in light of a ruling from the ICJ declaring Israel’s presence in Palestinian territories to be illegal. However, the Government has repeatedly rejected calls to expel Israel’s ambassador, citing the need to keep diplomatic relations open. In response to Ireland’s position, Israel has taken several retaliatory diplomatic measures, including formally reprimanding Irish Ambassador Sonya McGuinness in May. Ms McGuinness was summoned to the Israeli foreign ministry and shown video of the October 7th atrocities as part of what the country’s government called a “severe démarche”, a type of formal diplomatic reprimand. The Tánaiste called the move “totally unacceptable and no way to treat diplomats”. Israel had also ceased facilitating visits by Irish and Norwegian diplomats to the West Bank and Gaza and had informally been less co-operative with Irish officials there, sources said. In response to queries on Friday, Israel’s embassy in Dublin said the decision to recall Ms Erlich was not taken lightly “and follows the troubling rise in anti-Israel discourse in Ireland, which has often mutated into anti-Semitism and the delegitimisation of Israel”. Many accusations against Israel “have crossed the line into vilification, incitement and libels”, it said. “There are even arguments against Israel’s right of self-defence. These accusations have promoted an inhospitable environment for the Jewish and Israeli communities in Ireland, causing many among them to express significant concerns.” * This article was amended on Saturday September 7th to include an attribution on the number of people killed in Gaza ",0,1
2024/9/8,"Failure to set out intentions clearly may have hurt Sinn Féin, says Ó Broin Dublin Mid-West TD says he is pleased with reaction to Sinn Féin’s housing plan  Sinn Féin’s failure to set out clearer plans in key policy areas may have contributed to the party’s recent problems in the polls, according to Eoin Ó Broin, who says the housing plan published this week has the potential to attract back previous supporters and appeal to undecideds.  Speaking to Anton Savage on Newstalk on Sunday, Sinn Féin’s housing spokesperson said he was pleased with the reaction to the outline of how it would, if in government, deliver some 300,000 new homes, including 50,000 affordable ones over a five-year period. He said that although there had been the expected criticism from the Government and other rival parties, “nobody’s thrashing the plan. Lots and lots of people in the public and private sectors are saying it has merit, there are some really interesting things and we are the only party who has set out a comprehensive, multiannual, fully costed plan to deliver tens of thousands of affordable homes”. Pressed on why the party’s high profile policies on housing hasn’t previously translated into higher levels of support given the importance the public attaches to the subject, Mr Ó Broin suggested the party may have struggled to communicate its intentions to the electorate. “If I was to be self-critical,” he said, “I would say we probably have not been strong enough in setting out to people in very clear terms, not only what we want to do in government, but how we would do it and how that would benefit people. “The whole point of publishing this plan ... we’re saying to voters, ‘look, housing is the number one issue for you in this upcoming election’. And keep in mind in mind, in those polls, 10 to 20 per cent of people are undecided. ‘Listen to what we’re saying. Look at the plan. Sinn Féin is looking to bring home ownership back into the reach of working people, give us a chance to do it’.” He said the party’s willingness to engage with key industry stakeholders when formulating the policy and commitment to establish structures in which they would have a voice had been reflected in the reaction from those representative bodies in recent days. “What we’ve done is gone and talked to the people who deliver the homes on the public and private sector sides. And the question I kept asking them was, ‘what do you need to be able to deliver more good quality homes at an accelerated pace and, where possible, at a lower price?’ And we’ve taken that advice. “The Housing Commission has also made really strong recommendations. One of the big recommendations that we’ve accepted is they want a housing supply oversight executive. We’ve talked that through with them and it’s a very sensible idea to get together the folks from a big budgets, Uisce Éireann, the Transport Authority, the energy suppliers and public and private sector developers to align their capital programs.”",0,1
2024/9/8,"Government open to reviewing stamp duty for investment funds that bulk-buy houses, says Minister No agreement reached yet on increasing rate, says Darragh O’Brien, following calls from Neale Richmond to double rate to 20% The Government has not agreed on a doubling of the tax on investment funds that purchase houses in bulk but is open to reviewing the stamp duty, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has said. He said he is working on proposals with the Minister for Finance, Jack Chambers, but that it would not be “appropriate” to discuss what potential increases there may be. The Fianna Fáil TD’s comments come following a report in the Sunday Times that the Fine Gael Minister of State in the Department of Finance, Neale Richmond, said his party wanted the rate of stamp duty on the bulk purchase of new homes by investment funds to be doubled to 20 per cent. Speaking also on RTÉ radio’s This Week programme on Sunday, Mr Richmond said the higher rate of 10 per cent had worked “to an extent” and had “slowed down” bulk purchases but, describing Fine Gael as the “party of home ownership”, he said there was now a case for doubling the rate to 20 per cent. Speaking to The Irish Times on Sunday, Mr O’Brien said: “Nothing is agreed yet in relation to any of our budgetary measures.” He said that setting the rate of stamp duty was “a matter for the Government as a collective and there are many proposals being worked through”. The Minister said he had met Mr Chambers and they were “very open” to reviewing the rate. “I don’t think it would be appropriate that we get into a discussion on what rates would look like, or what potential increases that there may be,” he added. “My big focus is on continuing the very significant progress we’ve seen in housing output ... I want to maintain the first-time buyer supports and expand them, if at all possible, under the First Home Scheme, the Help to Buy grant as well. “There are discussions I’ve been having with Minister Chambers as well and obviously, as this is a tax measure, the stamp duty measure, the lead department is Finance, but Government as a collective will decide.” Separately, a spokesperson for Mr Chambers said he will discuss all budget-related matters with party leaders in the coming days and weeks. “The Department of Finance has conducted a review of stamp duty for bulk purchases which will be considered by the Minister for Finance and Government Ministers in the coming period. As budgetary negotiations are ongoing it would be inappropriate to comment until such matters have concluded. Budget 2025 will be delivered on October 1st,” he said. Mr Richmond said that even though the Government had voted down a Sinn Féin proposal to increase the rate at the start of the year, the proper time for budget proposals was in the autumn. He said institutional funds had some role to play but not to the extent they were currently doing, which he said saw 600 homes being purchased in bulk this year. He said he would be raising the proposal in talks with Mr Chambers this week but had not discussed it in detail with him yet, nor with Mr O’Brien. Mr Richmond indicated that if a stamp duty increase for investment funds was not included in the budget he would push for it to be included in the Fine Gael election manifesto. He did not directly address suggestions put to him on RTÉ that he was trying to put pressure on Fianna Fáil, but said that he did not believe his proposal would cause friction within the Coalition. After a controversy arising from the bulk purchases of homes in a Kildare housing estate, the Government introduced the 10 per cent rate on purchases of 10 homes or more in May 2021. It applies to bulk purchases of houses rather than apartments and kicks in when 10 or more houses are bought by a single purchaser in any 12-month period. However, bulk purchases have continued in some instances, with examples in north Dublin. In January, the then minister for finance, Michael McGrath, argued that the higher rate had applied to fewer than 1 per cent of residential transactions, indicating that activity at this level was not significant. A Fianna Fáil source said that the party would not oppose such a move, but that there was likely to be some resistance within the Department of Finance amid concerns over the impact on some companies’ balance sheets and capital flows into Ireland. The source added that data suggested the practice had been effectively clamped down on, but that high-profile examples such as Ryanair buying houses to accommodate crews meant controversy could flare up around the practice – although this was different from the original problem which the Government was seeking to control.",0,1
2024/9/8,"Cosy British-Irish relations a welcome change, but to achieve reset considerable work required    Jump-starting a bilateral understanding is complex and delicate as both sides pursue common ground after a corrosive decade  The careful choreography of a thaw in British-Irish relations has been hard to miss: pints of Guinness in Chequers, chummy photographs at Lansdowne Road and swapped England, Ireland and Donegal jerseys aplenty. Countless columns have expanded on Keir Starmer’s affection for Ireland and the greening of his backroom team, while officials have earnestly entreated nuggets about the gelling of relationships between Taoiseach Simon Harris and the British prime minister — by all accounts, a genuine one, with the two said to be trading good-natured jibes during the England versus Republic of Ireland soccer match on Saturday. However, beneath the cladding of a recast relationship, the work of jump-starting British-Irish affairs is complex and delicate as the two sides try to find common ground after almost a decade of corrosion. Part of it, says one person involved in bilateral talks, is about trying to counteract a “drift” between the two systems which has been under way for years. When Britain was part of the EU, official-to-official contact on intricate and boring European policies was a daily occurrence, while during the Brexit wars ministerial and intergovernmental exchanges organised under the auspices of the Belfast Agreement structures stagnated. Strategists in Dublin say that an effort to reknit systems will focus on more prosaic work around areas of common interest. There is much enthusiasm over the commitment to annual summits between Taoiseach and prime minister, alongside as many Cabinet ministers as can be mustered. This, say sources, is a non-Brexit, non-Northern Ireland channel that can be worked assiduously. But before the politicians gather, the hope is that networks between officials can be reanimated on the topics chosen: security; energy and climate; culture, education and people; and trade and the economy. The big, thorny topics cannot be ignored, of course. The question of Britain’s future relationship with the EU and Northern Ireland will loom large and, notwithstanding photo opportunities or diligent efforts to encourage official co-operation, will define the success or otherwise of the resetting project in a much more meaningful way. On the former, much has been made of the Republic’s capacity to be an interlocutor as relations between London and Brussels progress. There is, for the first time in years, at least a presumption of good faith on both sides but the fine detail of this is where it will be tricky. How can a closer relationship be forged that mends economic ties but stops short of Britain rejoining the customs union, while also operating within the confines of Britain’s post-2016 political culture? How does the unrest in European politics, with a new commission bedding itself in against a backdrop of turmoil in France and Germany, play into this? Merging the ambition with the realpolitik will not be easy. On the North, Starmer’s genuine willingness to look again at the Legacy Act question is appreciated, but all parties know the Republic will not drop its legal case under the European Convention on Human Rights on hope value alone. Exactly what Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn proposes, and how it goes down in Dublin, will be a key juncture. A Stormont Executive with staying power would also be helpful to both sides. All parties say the glad-handing shows a genuine commitment to maintaining good relations — but that alone gets you only so far.",0,1
2024/9/8,"Phil Hogan appointed to internal Fine Gael election committee Former EU commissioner who resigned after Golfgate scandal has built an extensive advisory business since stepping back from politics Mr Hogan, who resigned his position as EU trade commissioner in 2020 after being caught up in the Golfgate scandal, has built an extensive advisory business since stepping back from politics. It is understood he is satisfied that no conflict of interest exists between his work with Fine Gael and his lobbying work. Mr Hogan will be joined on the committee by Fine Gael general secretary John Carroll, former tánaiste and minister for justice Frances Fitzgerald, the former TD Olwyn Enright who is heading up election strategy and campaign planning for the party, and Dublin Rathdown TD Colm Brophy. The Sunday Independent, which first reported the move, said the committee will report to Taoiseach Simon Harris directly. Mr Harris said that he had taken advice from Mr Hogan, among others, while he was presumptive taoiseach after Leo Varadkar indicated he would be stepping down but before the Wicklow TD was elected as leader of Fine Gael. Official filings made by Mr Hogan, who also previously served as agriculture commissioner, declared some €1 million in annual revenues from his consultancy firm Triton Advisory in 2022, including from Visa, Vodafone and glass and metal products supplier Ardagh. His clients also include a digital finance business, Proof of Trust, which has been in repeated contact with the cabinet of his successor as Ireland’s European commissioner. Mr Hogan resigned his post after he lost the support of the three coalition leaders following his controversial attendance at a dinner organised by the Oireachtas golf society during Covid-19 restrictions which also led to the resignation of then minister for agriculture Dara Calleary. He later said the government leaders in Ireland had acted on a “populist wave of indignation”.",0,1
2024/9/9,"Lobbying register expanded to include 60 more public bodies  HSE, Central Bank, Department of Defence and Road Safety Authority among organisations now covered  Anybody who lobbies the organisations named in a new statutory instrument will have to register as they would do if they were lobbying local or central Government bodies. The Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 introduced transparency into the process of lobbying Government departments. The Programme for Government promised to expand the lobbying register to include other bodies not named in the original legislation. The statutory instrument was signed into law by the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe and will come into force on January 1st. Commenting on its implementation he said: “I welcome the implementation of this programme for Government commitment which will make the workings of Government more transparent. Transparency is an essential part of promoting trust in Government. “Lobbying is a key part of the democratic process. It plays an important role in policy formation. However, it needs to be open to public scrutiny. The people of Ireland should be able to monitor the potential influence that interest groups and representative bodies have on public policy issues and decisions. “By further strengthening our lobbying regime, and expanding the register, we ensure it continues to deliver on the objectives set for it. This measure will expand the range of officials who are covered by the legislation and this means that more information will be available to the public.” The Statutory Instrument will commence on January 1st, 2025. From that date, senior officials within the public bodies covered, with significant policymaking or development roles, will be required to advise lobbyists that they are Designated Public Officials (DPOs). Any interactions with DPOs must be reported by lobbyists in accordance with the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015. The 2015 Act also provides that, in certain circumstances, public servants who are prescribed as DPOs, are restricted from engaging in lobbying, for a year after they leave their employment or office. In effect, they are subject to a cooling-off period in respect of their involvement in particular lobbying activities.",0,1
2024/9/9,"Fifteen things to expect in Leo Varadkar’s autobiography Former taoiseach to publish his memoirs next year in a publishing deal reportedly involving a six-figure sum Former taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced at the weekend that he will be writing an autobiography which will be released in the autumn of next year. The book will be published by the Penguin Ireland imprint Sandycove which acquired the rights after a nine-way auction. The deal for the 45-year old Fine Gael politician’s book reportedly involves a six-figure sum. “I have the freedom now to say things I could not while holding office and I have enough distance to reflect on the mistakes I made as much as what was achieved,” he said in a statement announcing the deal. Here are some of the key issues and areas that Mr Varadkar will be expected to address. Mr Varadkar’s parents are Indian and Irish. In interviews he has said he eschewed his Indian heritage throughout his adolescence and only came to understand it and appreciate it as an adult. In his 20s, Varadkar was a classic Christian Democrat, a free market proponent and socially conservative. His belief in the free market remains undiminished but he pivoted dramatically on social issues from being a social conservative who opposed abortion and same-sex marriage to a liberal. In early 2015, Varadkar disclosed in an interview with Miriam O’Callaghan that he was a gay man adding that it was “not a secret”. But the knowledge of his sexuality until then was confined to a relatively small group and was not known to the wider public. His public announcement was another sign of a new culture of openness and acceptance in Ireland that led to the same-sex marriage referendum being overwhelmingly passed later that year. His memoir will be expected to address his journey with his sexuality. Varadkar had not finished his training by the time he became a full-time politician although he later completed his GP training. Would he have been happy to have continued in medicine? When did he take the decision that politics would be his chosen career path? From early in his career when he attacked then taoiseach Bertie Ahern for being “devious and cunning”, Varadkar cultivated an image as a politician who called things as they were. His public praise of Garda whistleblower Maurice McCabe in 2014 was received by some in Fine Gael and in the media as an indirect criticism of his Government colleague, then minister for justice Alan Shatter, who was later forced to resign after being criticised by a report written by senior counsel Sean Guerin (which Shatter later successfully challenged in the courts). Relationships between him and Shatter are said to have plummeted after the interview. Varadkar’s support for Richard Bruton during his failed leadership heave against Enda Kenny in 2010, and Kenny’s decision to restore him to the front bench immediately. When his own ambition to become Fine Gael leader crystallised, the moves he made towards replacing Enda Kenny as party leader after the 2016 general election, and when he began to put his leadership campaign together. Within 48 hours of Kenny resigning in 2017, Varadkar already had an unassailable lead against any potential rival. His time as minister for health. Like a litany of other senior politicians before him, Varadkar had a short and unsuccessful stint in an always difficult portfolio. The nadir of his time was when he said in an RTÉ interview that the national children’s hospital will be built by 2020 “short of an asteroid hitting the planet”. By the time he resigned as Taoiseach, the Bill for the incomplete hospital was being estimated at close to €2.4 billion. Varadkar became taoiseach just as the negotiations to deal with the implications and logistics of Brexit were beginning in earnest. He dealt firstly with Theresa May and then from 2019 with Boris Johnson. They held a well-publicised meeting in the Wirral in October 2019, which replaced the backstop with the Northern Ireland Protocol. Johnson would subsequently renege on the deal and the bonhomie of the meeting would not last, with relationship cooling between the Irish Government and the prime minister, and his successors Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Varadkar was on his annual trip to Washington DC in March 2020 when it became apparent that the Covid-19 coronavirus had taken hold in Ireland and required immediate intervention. From the US capital he gave a live address to the Irish public in which he announced the first shutdown and the beginning of two years when – for long periods – normal life and activity were suspended. He is expected to describe the experience of leading the Government through those crucial months. The most controversial moment happened in autumn of that year when he criticised then chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) for some of the restrictions they were proposing, and said members of Nphet would never have to go on furlough like workers affected by lockdowns. He also suggested there was an impression that some members had assumed the role of Government. Last year, Varadkar said he had gone too far in his remarks and apologised for them. “I was very angry at the time at the way the advice from Nphet had changed very dramatically overnight. The Government wasn’t consulted on that. It was briefed to the media before the Government was informed, which left a lot of us very frustrated.” The circumstances around his decision to share the text of an agreement reached with the Irish Medical Organisation over a new pay deal for general practitioners with Maitiú Ó Tuathail, an acquaintance who was head of a rival medical organisation. It led to an inquiry by SIPO which is still ongoing. How he and Micheál Martin came to an agreement to form a Coalition between the two parties which had been the greatest rivals since the foundation of the State and his assessment on the future of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil as separate entities going into the future. Did he expect the party to perform so poorly in the 2020 general election and to be outpolled by Sinn Féin? The economy performed strongly while Varadkar was taoiseach and tánaiste but there were very strong headwinds, not least the continuing difficulties with the health services and the ongoing crisis in housing. Despite the additional resources and measures being employed by the Government, homelessness reached record levels under his watch. His relationship with Matt Barrett and how it changed his perspective on politics and made him reassess his own work-life balance. His decision to stand down as Taoiseach at the age of 45, a year before the next election. Was there pressure brought to bear or was the decision entirely his? Was it prompted by the prospect of a tough election, or the decision by numerous colleagues from Fine Gael not to contest the next election? What he plans to do next and if he intends to remain a part of public life. How does he assess how politics will pan out in Ireland over the next decade amid a more volatile political landscape?",0,1
2024/9/9,"Proposal to double stamp duty on bulk purchases of homes came as ‘surprise’ to Tánaiste Green Party pushes for once-off €560 child benefit payment for new parents as part of Budget negotiations Tánaiste Micheál Martin has expressed surprise at a Fine Gael proposal to increase stamp duty for bulk purchases of houses by investment funds saying it would have been “sensible” to wait for the outcome of a review of the issue. The Fianna Fáil leader’s criticism comes after junior finance minister Neale Richmond suggested at the weekend that the 10 per cent stamp duty charge for such purchases should be doubled. Mr Richmond said the 2021 previous intervention bringing in the 10 per cent rate had been effective at slowing the trend but that more action was now needed. He said he would raise the matter in budget talks with Minister for Finance Jack Chambers this week. The first pre-budget meeting involving the three Coalition leaders, Mr Chambers and the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe, was due to take place on Monday evening. At a press conference earlier today, Mr Martin said different ideas and proposals are generally floated at budget time. He urged caution “in terms of market sensitive issues” and said a “substantive review” of the stamp duty issue had already been commissioned. “That review is nearing completion and I’m surprised at Minister Neale Richmond’s comments yesterday because I would have thought the sensible thing would have been to await the outcome of the review because we must approach these issues ... in an evidence-based way”. Mr Martin also said: “There had been no heads up with the Minister for Finance in respect of this but look, we’ll engage on it.” Over the weekend Mr Richmond rejected suggestions he was playing politics with the proposal. Mr Martin said he is “conscious of the need for investment from the private sector in housing” and “if we keep chopping and changing or if there’s a lack of certainty in respect of that, that could damage investment in housing”. He said when the stamp duty review is published the Government “will take an informed decision on the basis of that”. The Government previously rejected a Sinn Féin proposal to increase the tax, which is levied on purchases of houses by buyers who have already bought 10 homes or more in 12 months, to 17 per cent. Speaking on Monday, Taoiseach Simon Harris denied the latest Fine Gael proposals on stamp duty would amount to a U-turn saying: “As I’ve consistently said ... if you make changes to taxation, you generally do it through the budgetary process. “Obviously, the three parties in Government will decide how best to address this and the Budget will be delivered on the first of October.” He also said he hoped to see progress on the issue “but that will be a matter for a budget day decision.” Separately, the Green Party is pushing for the introduction of a once-off €560 child benefit payment for new parents as part of budget negotiations. Party leader and Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman said parents of newborns face extra financial pressures like buying a cot or car seat. He said the once-off €560 payment, four times the regular €140 child benefit payment, would “give a very clear indication to parents that we’re supporting them and their newborn in those first weeks in a very tangible way”. The Taoiseach, Mr Harris, did not directly respond to the idea on Monday but said: “it’s an absolute priority for me, and I welcome the fact that it’s a priority for others in the Coalition, that this budget has a real focus on children, families, tackling child poverty”. Mr Martin – who has previously said his party wants a €10 increase to the regular child benefit payment – said the Green Party idea is an “interesting proposal”.",0,1
2024/9/9,"Budget solo-runs by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Greens point to near-end of Coalition All Jack Chambers has to do is read the newspapers and he’ll know exactly what his colleagues are going to ask for They’re coming thick and fast now. With the budget just three weeks away and a general election likely not too long afterwards, Ministers are increasingly making their pitches for budget measures in the media, filling the sky above Government Buildings with metaphorical kites. Many relate to housing – expected to be a central issue in the election campaign and political battleground for many debates. In recent days, the junior minister at the Department of Finance, Neale Richmond, suggested that bulk buying of housing units should see the stamp duty rate – already raised to 10 per cent in 2021 to deter the practice – doubled to 20 per cent. Having tabled a motion to increase the rate earlier this year, which the Government (including Richmond) voted against, Sinn Féin were entitled to a hollow laugh when they heard this. It was Fianna Fáil, however, which seemed more exercised about it. Speaking on Monday, Tánaiste Micheál Martin ticked off Richmond, saying he was “surprised” by the intervention and suggested it might have been wiser to wait for a review of the stamp duty rates to be completed. He noted too that there had been no “heads up” for the (Fianna Fáil) Minister for Finance Jack Chambers about Richmond’s bright idea. Translated, Martin was calling out a violation of the “no surprises” rule of Coalition management. And yet, Fianna Fáilers were not exactly behind the door when it came to launching a few kites of their own. Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien, The Irish Times reported, will seek to expand eligibility for the maximum grant of €30,000 under the Help to Buy scheme. About 2,400 renters who have applied for the scheme and are due to be assisted in 2025 could see their grants increased at a total cost of about €40 million. Elsewhere, it was reported over the weekend that Fine Gael wants to extend income disregards for carers, with a push under way for double lump-sum once-off payments – including for child benefit, fuel allowance, disability grants and the working family payment – possibly all before Christmas. The party is also expected to seek another hike in the rent tax credit to at least €1,000. The Greens are also not sitting on their hands. On Monday, party leader Roderic O’Gorman floated the idea for a payment of €560 for everyone who has a baby. “The idea is that alongside the initial child benefit payment of €140, there’d be a boost for that first payment, and we’re talking about quadrupling it and bringing it up to €560 for that first payment,” he told Claire Byrne on RTÉ radio. At least Chambers won’t be in for any nasty surprises when he sits down with his colleagues for those budget negotiations. All he has to do is read the newspapers and he’ll know what they’re going to ask for. What are we to make of all this? There is a newfound edginess in relations within Government, with all parties privately accusing each other of one-upmanship and trying to claim credit for each other’s initiatives. Fine Gael was annoyed that Chambers last month announced he was delaying a zoned land tax – and the Greens were furious. The Greens also think Fine Gael is trying to muscle in on their childcare initiatives. And Fianna Fáil thinks Simon Harris routinely tries to hog the credit for, well, everything. These tensions, of course, were to be expected as the Government reaches the last phase of its existence and the parties face up to the reality that they will soon be electoral rivals. But it will make the budget harder to do – and threaten a more serious breach in the Coalition. It will be a bumpy few weeks.",0,1
