2024/1/10,"Irish LGBTQI+ groups steadfastly support surrogacy after Pope's call for ban Irish LGBTQI+ groups said they will continue to support surrogacy after Pope Francis called for a universal ban on the practice this week. Three major Irish LGBT groups have responded after Pope Francis called for a universal ban on surrogacy during an address in Rome on Monday, January 8. “The desire to create and have a family is a universal one which includes people from the LGBTQI+ community,” LGBT Ireland, Irish Gay Dads, and Equality for Children said in a joint statement shared with GCN on January 9. “In many examples of family planning, infertility, whether medical or social, can lead people to look to routes such as adoption, assisted donor conception, and surrogacy to build their family. “We support the right of people to do this. ""We also support legislation that will protect and ensure the highest of standards are upheld to benefit all involved: the surrogate mother, the child, and the intending parents. “LGBT Ireland, Equality for Children, and Irish Gay Dads have been working together for the last number of years to campaign for legislation that is fully inclusive of all LGBTQI+ people. ""Before Christmas, we held a briefing for TDs and Senators and met directly with the Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly TD. The Assisted Human Reproduction Bill that is currently before the Oireachtas must ensure that the pathways to parenthood are open to everyone and that all children are treated equally.” Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The joint statement from the Irish LGBTQI+ groups was issued after Pope Francis called for a universal ban on surrogacy during a foreign policy address in Rome to ambassadors accredited to the Holy See. “The path to peace calls for respect for life, for every human life, starting with the life of the unborn child in the mother’s womb, which cannot be suppressed or turned into an object of trafficking,"" the Pope said during his address. “In this regard, I deem deplorable the practice of so-called surrogate motherhood, which represents a grave violation of the dignity of the woman and the child, based on the exploitation of situations of the mother’s material needs. “A child is always a gift and never the basis of a commercial contract. “Consequently, I express my hope for an effort by the international community to prohibit this practice universally.” As Citizens Information notes, there is no specific legislation for surrogacy in Ireland - it is not legal or illegal. However, as the Irish groups noted in their statement, legislation is underway in the Oireachtas. Ireland's Department of Health said on December 12 that the Irish Government had approved Committee Stage Amendments to the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022. The amendments, the Department noted, include ""new provisions in respect of the regulation of international surrogacy agreements and the recognition of certain past surrogacy arrangements.""",0,1
2024/1/11,"Ireland's new National Cycling Network to feature ""3,500km of safe bike corridors"" Ireland's National Cycling Network aims to provide 3,500km of safe cycling routes across the country. Ireland's Department of Transport has unveiled plans for a new National Cycling Network (NCN) which envisions 3,500km of safe bike corridors, connecting 2.8m people in cities and towns across the country. The new plan is comprised of 85 corridors, including existing and planned greenways in addition to an extensive new network of safe cycle routes planned for existing roads. The NCN aims to make it easier for people to make cycling a part of their daily lives, providing links to transport hubs, education centers, employment, and leisure and tourist destinations. The Government aims to ensure that 80% of homes and 90% of jobs are located within 5km of the network by the time it is finished. Implementation of the NCN will be on a phased basis. It is envisaged that approximately 1,000km of the plan (28% of the network) will be implemented by the end of 2030 as part of Phases 1 and 2, while Phase 3 will be implemented between 2031 and 2040.

""It is great to launch this plan today here along the Grand Canal Greenway because it shows that we are already well on the way to developing this new visionary national cycling network, with plans also underway to fast-track delivery of a further 1,000 km of cycle routes by 2030,"" Ryan said in a statement on Wednesday. ""This national cycling network will act as a core spine, connecting towns, cities, and destinations across the country with safe, segregated cycling infrastructure wherever feasible.

2024/1/11,"WATCH: Irish lawyer delivers argument in The Hague for genocide case against Israel Irish lawyer Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh KC said that ""there could not be a clearer or more compelling case"" for provisional measures to protect people in Gaza. Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh KC, the Irish lawyer serving as Counsel and Advocate for the Republic of South Africa to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), delivered a statement in The Hague today, Thursday, January 11. The ICJ announced on December 29 that South Africa had filed an application instituting proceedings against Israel, alleging that Israel ""in relation to Palestinians in Gaza, is in violation of its obligations under the Genocide Convention.” The public hearings at the ICJ at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the seat of the Court, began today; South Africa’s team is delivering its oral arguments on Thursday while Israel’s team will deliver oral arguments tomorrow, Friday, January 12. “There is an urgent need for provisional measures to protect Palestinians in Gaza from the irreparable prejudice caused by Israel’s violations of the Genocide Convention,” Ní Ghrálaigh told the court on Thursday. ""There could not be a clearer or more compelling case."" She asserted: “It is becoming ever clearer that huge swathes of Gaza — entire towns, villages, refugee camps — are being wiped from the map."" Ní Ghrálaigh said how in Gaza, ""nearly two million people — over 85 percent of the population"" have been forced to flee their homes and shelters, oftentimes more than once, into ""ever-shrinking slivers of land, where they continue to be bombed and killed. ""This is a population that Israel had already made vulnerable through 16 years of military blockade and crippling 'de-development.'"" She said: ""Without a halt to Israel’s military activity in Gaza, there will be no end to the extreme situation facing Palestinian civilians."" Ní Ghrálaigh went on to argue: ""It would be a complete departure from the long and distinguished line of jurisprudence that this Court has firmly established — and recently reconfirmed — for the Court not to order provisional measures in this case. ""The imminent risk of death, harm, and destruction that Palestinians in Gaza face today, and that they risk every day during the pendency of these proceedings, on any view justifies — indeed compels — the indication of provisional measures. ""Some might say that the very reputation of international law — its ability and willingness to bind and to protect all peoples equally — hangs in the balance."" Ní Ghrálaigh said: ""The international community continues to fail the Palestinian people, despite the overt dehumanizing genocidal rhetoric by Israeli governmental and military officials, matched by the Israeli military’s actions on the ground; despite the horror of the genocide against the Palestinian population being livestreamed from Gaza to our mobile phones, computers, and televisions screens — the first genocide in history where its victims are broadcasting their own destruction in real-time in the desperate — so far vain — hope that the world might do something."" According to the AP, a decision on the request for so-called “provisional measures” will likely take weeks. The case is likely to last years. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! South Africa's genocide case against Israel has been formally endorsed by more than a dozen other countries and international organizations; Ireland has not endorsed the case, though it has been consistent in calling for a ceasefire. On Sunday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on RTÉ Radio that Ireland ""does not intend"" to join the proceedings. ""I really think this is an area where we need to be very careful,"" Varadkar said. “What’s happened in Gaza is appalling - over 20,000 people killed, mostly innocent civilians, mostly women and children, very possibly war crimes committed both by Israel and Hamas when it comes to the events of the last few months. ""Genocide is something very particular. It is defined as an attempt, a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire nation, an entire race, or to do so in large part. “And one group of people that has experienced that in the world are Jewish people, the Holocaust. Six million Jews killed here in Europe, and Hitler had a plan to kill many millions more – that is genocide."" Varadkar added: ""We need to be very careful about genocide in that context."" He said the international court will determine whether or not the situation in Gaza is genocide. Ireland's opposition parties disagree with Varadkar's stance. On Tuesday, representatives from Irish political parties Sinn Féin, Labour, Social Democrats, and People Before Profit called upon the Irish Government to join the proceedings. On Thursday, the day the public hearings began in The Hague, TD Matt Carthy, Sinn Féin's spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, said: “I welcome that South Africa made the decision to take this case to the International Court of Justice under the Genocide Convention. ""As a signatory to the Convention, the Irish government is also legally obliged to take action to prevent genocide and, in Sinn Féin’s view, they should reverse position."" He added: “It smacks of the double standards that have been evident since the war in Gaza began that governments, including Ireland, that supported the case taken against Russia now refuse to do so in the case of Israel."" He further added: “The Irish people have been horrified by the actions of Israel in Gaza and the failure of the international community to demand they stop. ""They have welcomed the strong words of the Irish government. ""They now want to see these words being matched by actions.""",0,1

Two people have died in separate collisions in Dublin and Kildare over the weekend, taking the total number of deaths on Irish roads to 10 since the beginning of the year. A male pedestrian died in Dublin after being hit by a car at around 4 a.m. on Sunday. The man was pronounced dead at the scene and no other injuries were reported. The incident took place on a stretch of road between Junction 4 and 5 of the M1 motorway near Lusk in North County Dublin. The road has reopened after being sealed off for a forensic investigation.

In Kildare, a man was killed in a single-vehicle collision in Kilcullen at around 6:15 p.m. on Saturday. The collision took place on the R448 road at Halverstown and the man, who was driving an SUV, was pronounced dead at the scene. The man's body has been taken to Naas General Hospital for a post-mortem. Anyone with any information or dash cam footage is asked to contact Naas Garda Station on 045 884 300, the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111, or any garda station. Minister for Environment, Climate, and Communications Eamon Ryan told RTÉ's This Week that a number of measures will be implemented throughout the year to improve road safety in Ireland. Ryan said the Government will be reducing default speed limits in order to reduce road fatalities. Ryan added that An Garda Síochána needed to increase enforcement on Irish roads but said the Government would be installing more speed cameras, especially in particularly dangerous areas. ""That'll help the gardaí to do their job without always having to have a member of the force there in every place,"" Ryan told RTÉ. Jack Chambers, the Minister of State with Responsibility for Road Safety, stated that a ""culture of recklessness"" has developed on Irish roads. Chambers described the deaths of 10 people on Irish roads since January 1 as the worst possible start to 2024, adding that a significant number of motorists are ignoring the need to slow down. Chambers also said a number of motorists continue to drive while intoxicated. He told RTÉ's Morning Ireland that he will be fast-tracking legislation over the next three months to help reduce road fatalities. The new legislation will allow local authorities to review current speed limits, Chambers told Morning Ireland. He added that motorists who commit multiple offenses at the same time will now face two sets of penalty points as opposed to the current system, which imposes one set of penalty points. The legislation will also introduce mandatory drug testing at the scene of all road traffic accidents. Chambers noted that the number of Garda roads policing personnel has decreased by 47 compared to the same time last year but said the issue is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. ""I've been very clear to him and to his team on the need to ensure that there's a road policing dividend from the increased recruitment that we’re seeing in 2024,"" Chambers said. Several road safety groups have expressed concern about the number of road fatalities in Ireland since the beginning of the year. Susan Gray of the PARC Road Safety Group said the figures were ""extremely worrying"" and called on the Government to ""go back to the drawing board"" to reduce road fatalities. Leo Lieghio, the vice president of the Irish Road Victims Association, also described the figures as ""very worrying"". ""Absolutely, definitely going in the wrong direction. It's a very worrying figure,"" he told RTÉ News. The Road Safety Authority recently announced that 184 people were killed on Irish roads in 2023, a jump of 19% compared to 2022.",0,1

A multi-layered naming rights deal for Páirc Uí Chaoimh will be tabled for Cork County Board delegates to ratify in a closed-door meeting tonight, January 16, according to a report from the Irish Examiner. The Irish Examiner reports the deal is worth between €250,000 and €300,000 a year to Cork GAA. Three other companies — Boston Scientific, Statkraft, and PepsiCo — will also have subsidiary stadium branding privileges as part of the package. The Páirc Uí Chaoimh stadium company filed an operating loss of around €331,000 last year, the Irish Examiner noted. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Cork GAA describes Páirc Uí Chaoimh as the “celebrated Gaelic games stadium” in Ballintemple, Co Cork. The first stadium was opened in 1904 as the Cork Athletic Grounds and was later reopened as Páirc Uí Chaoimh in 1976. The Stadium underwent an extensive two-year renovation commencing in 2015 before reopening its doors in 2017. The stadium is named in honor of Padraig O Caoimh, who served as General Secretary of the GAA from 1929 through 1964. News of the rebrand, which emerged on Monday, came as a shock to many, including Dónal Ó Caoimh, the grandson of Padraig O’Caoimh.

Dónal said he found it ""galling"" that SuperValu ""would consider making the eradication of my grandfather’s legacy a condition of sponsorship."" He continued: ""The gateway is open for the sale of our heritage and narrative for profit. ""My grandfather’s story inspires young players to dream. You take away the absence of focus on money and corporations from games and you have lost what makes the GAA unique. The cornerstone of the organisation is volunteerism not corporations.""

He added: ""I have faith that Páirc Uí Chaoimh will forever retain its original name in the hearts and minds of the people of Cork. ""I understand the importance for raising funds for the sustainability of the GAA but there needs to be sensitivity to history.

2024/1/2,"Ireland expands free contraception scheme to include women aged 31 Ireland's free contraception scheme, first launched in September 2022, has been expanded to include women aged 31. Ireland’s Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly announced on January 1 the expansion of the free contraception scheme to include women aged 31, as previously announced in Budget 2024. Ireland's free contraception scheme is open to women, girls, and other people identifying as transgender or non-binary who are ordinarily resident in Ireland and for whom prescription contraception is deemed suitable by their doctors. The scheme was launched in September 2022, initially for those aged 17 to 25, and expanded to include 26-30-year-olds in 2023. Access to free contraception has now been expanded as of January 1, 2024 to include women aged 31. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! ""I am delighted to announce the further expansion of the free contraception scheme to those aged 31,"" Minister Donnelly said on Monday. ""Incrementally improving access to contraception is a key priority for this government, supporting positive sexual health and choice in family planning. ""The scheme is an important support for women’s health, and for equality, given that the costs of contraception are typically faced by women. ""Moreover, in the context of current cost-of-living pressures, this is another support for women and their families that reduces costs."" Ireland's Department of Health noted that the scheme covers the cost of consultations with GPs, family planning, student health and primary care centres, and prescriptions for the wide range of contraceptive options available on the Health Service Executive (HSE) Re-Imbursement List. These options include long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs). LARCs include injections, implants, and hormonal and copper intra-uterine devices and systems (coils). The scheme also includes emergency contraception in addition to the oral contraceptive pill, patch, and ring. LARC fittings, removals, injections, and checks are also free of charge under the scheme. Prescriptions are dispensed at a local pharmacy of choice. If LARCs are chosen (coils and implants, for example), patients return to a service provider participating in the scheme to have the device fitted, and subsequently removed. All of these costs are fully covered by the State and are free of charge to the patient. The Department added that in addition to its primary use, hormonal contraception also plays a key role in treating adverse symptoms, such as pain and heavy bleeding, that can be associated with periods. Almost 2,400 GPs, primary care, family planning and student health centres, and other related community medical facilities, and 2,050 community pharmacies have signed up to provide services and products under the scheme to date. Approximately €41.5 million is allocated to support the scheme in 2024. Further information regarding both free prescription contraception and the National Condom Distribution Service is available through the HSE’s Sexual Wellbeing website. This information is regularly updated and provides full details of how to access the scheme. Ireland's free contraception scheme is a sign of fast-changing times in the country, where the sale of contraception was illegal from 1935 until 1979 when regulations dictated it could only be used for family-planning purposes at the discretion of a doctor. It was not fully legalized until 1993.",0,1

2024/1/2,"Ireland avoided excess deaths during core pandemic years, OECD research shows Ireland was one of nine OECD countries to avoid excess deaths during the core pandemic years of 2020 through 2022. New research shows that Ireland had no excess deaths during the core pandemic years of 2020-2022, Ireland’s Department of Health said today, January 2. Research published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows that Ireland was one of nine OECD countries to avoid excess deaths during this period, registering the fourth lowest rate behind New Zealand, Iceland, and Norway. 'Excess deaths' refers to the number of deaths from all causes during a period of time, above what would normally be expected. The OECD measured the difference between the number of people who died between 2020 and 2022 and the number of people who would have been expected to die during that time if the pandemic had not happened. Excess death figures include those who died from COVID-19 without having been tested as well as from other illnesses. Excess deaths is considered a very objective metric and scientists say it is the most reliable measure of the total impact of the pandemic during these years. Previous estimates of excess deaths during the pandemic did not take into account changes in population size and demographics. The OECD reviewed the methodology used to calculate excess deaths and accounted for demographic trends in each country. Ireland’s total population increased by 8% between the 2016 and 2022 census while the number of people aged 65 and over increased by 22% during the same period. This is more than double the 10% increase in the EU 27 countries in the same time period. Adjusting mortality rates to take account of these changes has shown that Irelanddid not record excess mortality during 2020-2022. In fact, Ireland had a lower-than-expected death rate. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Ireland’s Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said: ""I am very pleased to be able to report that Ireland’s excess mortality during the core pandemic years was the fourth lowest among OECD countries. ""Ireland asked a lot of its population during this time and the restrictions that were put in place had a profound impact on us all. ""These figures point to the success of Ireland’s public health measures, and to the strong uptake of our COVID-19 vaccination programme."" Ireland’s Chief Medical Officer Professor Breda Smyth said: ""The OECD Working Paper highlights some of the important caveats associated with previously published estimates on excess mortality during the core pandemic years. ""The population in Ireland demonstrated a strong adherence to public health measures during this time, and Ireland’s COVID-19 vaccination programme has been one of the most successful in the world, with 96% of the adult population receiving their primary vaccinations. ""We know that vaccines save lives, as well as preventing serious illness and hospitalisations. ""COVID is still with us, and immunity wanes over time, so I would like to remind all those who are eligible to top up their protection with a COVID booster this winter, as well as keeping up to date with their flu vaccine.""",0,1
2024/1/22,"WATCH: Ireland’s longest-serving Senator calls for peace in final address Senator David Norris, the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in Ireland, is resigning from the Seanad Éireann. Senator David Norris, 79, delivered his final address in the Seanad Éireann today, January 22, marking the end of his 36-year run as a Senator. After thanking his colleagues and all those who voted for him over the years, Senator Norris said: ""Since this is my last opportunity to speak on the floor of this House, I would like to continue to advocate for peace in Palestine, and in particular Gaza. ""What is happening to the inhabitants of Gaza is appalling and cannot be allowed to continue. ""Man's inhumanity to man is our greatest shame, and I have to say, also, that it goes completely against the Jewish ethic, which is 'l'chaim,' or 'to life.' ""The present [Israeli] Government under Netanyahu has committed them to death instead of to life, and to death in overwhelming numbers for the unfortunate trapped citizens of Gaza. I deplore it completely. ""What is happening is appalling and cannot be allowed to continue. Man's inhumanity to man is our greatest shame. I urge Senators to continue to push for peace in our times. ""Finally, I would like to voice my support for the forthcoming referenda on the family. It is important that they succeed, and even though I will be retired, I will be, to the best of my ability, campaigning for their success."" Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Norris, the first openly gay person to hold public office in Ireland, is credited with spearheading the battle to decriminalize homosexuality in the Republic of Ireland. In the 1970s, Norris founded the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform, which featured Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, both future Presidents of Ireland, as advisors. In 1983, Norris went to the Irish Supreme Court to challenge the constitutionality of the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act and the 1885 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, laws which made homosexuality an offense that had been passed before Irish independence and had been since repealed in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Norris was unsuccessful. In 1987, Norris was elected to the Seanad as an Independent; he has been re-elected at each election since. Upon his resignation this month, Norris is the longest-serving member of the Seanad in the history of the Irish State. The following year, Norris took a case to the European Court of Human Rights to argue that Irish law was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. This time he was successful in his efforts, and the ECHR ruled that the criminalization of male homosexuality in the Republic of Ireland violated the right to privacy in personal affairs. Five years later, Minister for Justice Maire Geoghegan-Quinn included decriminalization with an equal age of consent in a bill to deal with various sexual offenses. No parties in the Oireachtas opposed decriminalization. Mary Robinson, who had represented Norris in his Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights case, was President of Ireland and ultimately signed the act into law when it passed the Dáil in 1993. Two days after the bill passed the Dáil, Norris wrote in the Irish Times: “When, next week, this Bill is passed by Seanad Éireann and sent to the President for signature I will, for the first time in my life, feel that I am at last a full and equal citizen in my own country.” Norris has sponsored 34 bills throughout his tenure as a Senator. While he received several tributes in the SSeanad on Monday following his final address, he also received written tributes from Preisdent Michael D. Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. ""Your legacy as a champion of equality and diversity will continue to inspire future generations to come,"" President Higgins wrote. An Cathaoirleach Jerry Buttimer said in the Seanad on Monday that Varadkar wrote: ""In your campaigns, you showed true leadership, standing for causes that were unpopular and poorly understood but, above all, were appealing to our best instincts as human beings: kindness, compassion, tolerance and acceptance.""",0,1

""If we reject the human rights system, we reject the only universally agreed roadmap to honor human dignity and that will be a disaster.

2024/1/26,"Tánaiste “strongly welcomes” ICJ’s orders for Israel to prevent genocide in Gaza The Irish Government will now ""strongly consider intervention"" in South Africa's genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice. Tánaiste Micheál Martin has responded after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued its orders on the request for provisional measures in the South Africa v. Israel case. The ICJ ordered today, January 26, that Israel take measures to prevent genocide in Gaza and enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip. Israel has also been ordered to submit a report to the ICJ in one month outlining its efforts to adhere to the ICJ's orders. ""I strongly welcome the Court’s orders which are final and binding,"" the Tánaiste said in a statement today after the orders were announced. ""These are measures that Ireland has been consistently calling for from the start of this conflict."" The Tánaiste continued: ""We expect Israel to implement all provisional measures that have been ordered by the Court, in good faith and as a matter of urgency. ""While the Court has not called for a ceasefire, the Court has ordered Israel and the IDF not to commit any acts of genocide, and importantly has ordered Israel to take immediate and effective measures to ensure urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance are provided in Gaza. ""These orders are binding and the Court has ordered Israel to report in one month to demonstrate compliance with its orders. ""It is also imperative that Israel prevents and punishes incitement to genocide. ""As I have repeatedly made clear, bringing about an end to this conflict and to the death and destruction in Gaza is a priority that must be pursued on all fronts – political, diplomatic, humanitarian, and legal. That is my overwhelming priority. ""I reiterate the position of the Government that an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of hostages, and full, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access is needed in Gaza. ""Today’s orders relate to a specific case under the Genocide Convention. Irrespective of whether any actions are eventually judged to meet the threshold of genocide, we must ensure that all parties to this conflict are held to account for their actions. ""The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court is continuing to investigate all serious allegations of crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in and from Gaza, whether committed by Israel or by Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or other non-state armed groups. All States must redouble their efforts to support the investigation by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court into the situation in Palestine.

South Africa's genocide case against Israel has been formally endorsed by more than a dozen other countries and international organizations; Ireland has not endorsed the case, though it has been consistent in calling for a ceasefire. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier in January that Ireland ""does not intend"" to join the ICJ proceedings. ""I really think this is an area where we need to be very careful,"" Varadkar said while speaking on RTÉ Radio. “What’s happened in Gaza is appalling - over 20,000 people killed, mostly innocent civilians, mostly women and children, very possibly war crimes committed both by Israel and Hamas when it comes to the events of the last few months. ""Genocide is something very particular. It is defined as an attempt, a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire nation, an entire race, or to do so in large part. “And one group of people that has experienced that in the world are Jewish people, the Holocaust. Six million Jews killed here in Europe, and Hitler had a plan to kill many millions more – that is genocide."" Varadkar added: ""We need to be very careful about genocide in that context."" He said the international court will determine whether or not the situation in Gaza is genocide. On Wednesday evening, a private members motion tabled by the Social Democrats demanding the Irish Government support South Africa and intervene in the case at the ICJ was defeated in the Dáil. As RTÉ reports, a Government amendment to the Social Democrats motion was ultimately passed by the lower house by a margin of 71 votes to 58.

In a statement on Monday, Eastwood reflected on the friendship and shared history between Ireland and the US and said ""we have a duty to be honest with our friends and allies - especially when we think they’re wrong."" Eastwood said that in his view, the scenes in Gaza represent ""a clear act of genocide"" and that the ""response of the US administration has been particularly atrocious."" The Derry politician recalled witnessing ""the impact of unspeakable violence in Gaza"" during a 2012 visit to Khan Younis. He continued: “In that context, and having seen its impact before, I cannot in good conscience attend White House parties for St Patrick’s Day while the administration turns its face the other way and refuses to call for an immediate ceasefire. I could not rub shoulders, drink Guinness, and have the craic while the horrifying impacts of the brutal war in Gaza continue. It would be the very opposite of solidarity with a people on the brink of destruction."" Eastwood acknowledged that every political leader ""will have to take their own decision on how they approach St. Patrick’s Day"" and said he is offering ""no criticism of anyone else because there is no easy answer to any of this."" ""But I know that my own conscience, and the values of the party I lead, are not consistent with celebration in the face of overwhelming violence."" He continued: “The SDLP will send a delegation to Washington DC. We will meet with senior lawmakers, with Irish-American leaders, and with Palestinian-Americans to make the case for an end to violence. ""It is in our party’s DNA to work toward peace wherever possible. We will use our influence to press strongly for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas. “I am not naive to the scale of the impact this action will have. But faced with the scenes of destruction across Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas of human habitation on our planet, I honestly believe it would be wrong to attend these celebrations and that not attending sends a far more powerful message. “The first, and most important, principle of peace is that the killing has to stop. The US has enormous influence over the pace of that first step in Gaza and southern Israel. I sincerely hope that they use it and join those of us calling for an immediate ceasefire soon.""

2024/1/29,"Redress payments for Mother and Baby Home survivors continue to be delayed The Department of Children has stated that opening a redress scheme as soon as possible remains a ""top priority."" Mother and Baby Home survivors continue to wait for redress payments three years after Ireland's Mother and Baby Home Commission of Investigation recommended compensation for survivors. The Department of Children has stated that opening a redress scheme as soon as possible remains a ""top priority,"" according to the Irish Examiner. The Department added that the redress scheme, which was due to be rolled out by the end of 2023, is set to open in Q1 of 2024. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! However, the Examiner reports that survivors are still waiting to receive the green light to apply. UCC law professor Conor O'Mahony described the delay as ""simply unfair"" to aging survivors. In 2021, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes recommended compensation for survivors in its final report and the Irish Government subsequently appointed a financial assessor to negotiate with seven religious institutions about compensation. However, there is no legal framework compelling the religious orders to negotiate, according to the Examiner. O'Mahony told the publication that the Government could open the scheme to survivors while negotiations are ongoing. ""There’s no need to wait until any contributions are handed over, just open the scheme and have it up and running,"" O'Mahony told the Irish Examiner. The Commission's five-year inquiry, which was led by former judge Yvonne Murphy, found that over 9,000 children died in 18 institutions run by seven different religious orders between 1922 and 1998, double the mortality rate among children in the general population. The final report also detailed shocking experiments and physical abuse carried out in the different institutions and recommended financial compensation for survivors. Up to 34,000 people are eligible for compensation, but the scheme has faced criticism because it excludes certain categories of survivors, including babies who spent less than six months in an institution and those who were fostered out to local families. O'Mahony said the Irish Government is attempting to lay financial responsibility on the seven religious orders as well as maintaining public finances. The seven religious orders include the Bon Secours sisters, the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary, Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, the Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of St John of God, and lay organization the Legion of Mary. Children's Minister Roderic O'Gorman has sought financial contributions from each religious order, but only the Bon Secour nuns, who ran the Tuam Mother and Baby Home in Galway between 1925 and 1961, have agreed to contribute to the redress scheme. However, the Examiner reports that no deal has been secured with the Bon Secours nuns. Peter Mulryan, a 79-year-old man who spent four years at the Tuam Mother and Baby Home before being fostered out to a family that abused him, labeled the delay as a ""disgrace"". ""The whole thing is a disgrace. I have never, ever received a penny from the State for the abuses and neglect I suffered,"" Mulryan told the Examiner. ""There isn’t a sign of anything. I am disgusted with it to be honest, what they are doing to us, they are playing a game of wait and die so they have less to give a few euros to."" Mulryan added that the delays were ""prolonging our agony"" and said he is skeptical that redress payments will be made this year. ""They say they are giving us redress this year, I take that with a pinch of salt, how many times did they promise this that, and the other?""",0,1

2024/1/8,"UK Government challenges Ireland over legal action against Troubles Legacy Act Northern Ireland Secretary has written to Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs to question the Irish Government's decision to challenge the controversial act in the European Court of Human Rights. The United Kingdom Government has formally written to the Irish Government to express regret over Dublin's decision to take legal action over the Troubles Legacy Act, which aims to grant conditional immunity to those accused of Troubles-era killings. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has written to Tánaiste and Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin to question the Irish Government's decision to challenge the Legacy Act in the European Court of Human Rights. The letter also challenges Martin to list the number of prosecutions mounted in the Irish State since 1998 related to incidents that occurred during the Troubles. Heaton-Harris has additionally pressed the Irish Government to answer questions regarding its own record on tackling Troubles-era incidents since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. British Ambassador to Ireland Paul Johnston issued the letter to Martin on Sunday evening. The UK Government's Troubles Legacy Act has been criticized by victims groups in Northern Ireland in addition to major parties on both sides of the political divide.

The act aims to grant conditional immunity to those who cooperate with the newly established Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery and will also halt civil cases and legacy inquiries. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said in December that the Irish Government was left with ""no option"" but to challenge the Act in the European Court of Human Rights. Martin also addressed the issue in December, stating that the Irish Government was reluctantly taking legal action after failing to persuade the UK Government to change its mind. In a statement to the PA News Agency, the UK Government's Northern Ireland Office confirmed that Heaton-Harris had penned a formal letter to Micheál Martin. ""The Secretary of State, in his letter, repeats his call for the Irish Government to clarify the number of criminal prosecutions brought in Ireland since 1998 relating to Troubles-related cases, and presses the Irish Government more widely to answer questions regarding its own record on tackling legacy issues in its own jurisdiction,"" the Northern Ireland Office said in a statement. ""The decision also comes before the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery, led by Sir Declan Morgan as chief commissioner, is fully established and able to demonstrate its ability to discharge the UK's international obligations. ""The UK government reasserts its particular disappointment that the Irish Government has taken this course of action without, to date, any engagement with the ICRIR to understand better how it intends to implement the legislation and deliver for victims and survivors.""",0,1

Late on Tuesday, Iran launched some 180 missiles into Israel. According to the Associated Press, Iran said it fired the missiles on Tuesday as retaliation for attacks that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Iranian military. Earlier on Tuesday, Israel said that it had begun limited ground operations against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. As the AP notes, Iran's attack on Israel on Tuesday is ""the latest in a series of escalating attacks in a yearslong conflict between Israel and Iran and its Arab allies that threatens to push the Middle East closer toward a regionwide war."" The day before Iran launched its missile attack on Israel, Ireland's Tánaiste participated in an extraordinary videoconference meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on the situation in Lebanon. “I call on all sides to immediately de-escalate and support efforts to reach a ceasefire,"" the Tánaiste said on Monday ahead of the Foreign Affairs Council meeting.

The Taoiseach, the Department said, condemned the actions of Hezbollah in firing missiles into Israel and expressed his condolences to the Prime Minister on the significant number of civilian deaths resulting from Israel’s bombardment and military incursion. The Taoiseach expressed Ireland’s continued commitment to supporting Lebanon, confirming that Ireland has provided a further €1 million in aid, bringing total assistance to Lebanon to €5 million in 2024. Harris and Mikati discussed the importance of UNIFIL’s mission in Lebanon, and their commitment to the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1701, which calls for ending hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel. The Taoiseach emphasised that the safety of the 380 Irish troops serving with UNIFIL is of paramount importance as well as the ability to carry out their mandate. The Taoiseach reiterated his deep concern that the situation could spiral out of control and risk a wider regional war. He called on all sides to step back from the brink and to agree an immediate ceasefire, stressing that what is needed urgently is a political and diplomatic solution that ensures security for Lebanon and Israel and that enables Lebanon to rebuild and prosper. The Taoiseach reassured Prime Minister Mikati that this is Ireland’s focus, working with partners in the EU and at the UN.

2024/10/1,"The six main takeaways as Budget 2025 will put Ireland ""on a firm footing for the future"" Ireland's Minister for Finance Jack Chambers believes Budget 2025 will ""ensure that all our people see a promising and hopeful future in this country."" The current government have delivered what will be their final budget ahead of the imminent General Election. The budget was brought forward by one week this year, with Minister for Finance Jack Chambers delivering what was described as a ""giveaway budget"" which would see €3,000 back into the pockets of the ""squeezed middle."" But with the cost of living still rising, and some people still wondering if they’ll feel said squeeze, what are the main takeaways from this year’s Budget? Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! One of the bigger payments that will be made is that of the new parent-child benefit — which will see a triple payment, worth €420, be paid upon birth. The child benefit will also be increased by €15 per month for the first six months of the baby’s life, totaling €835. As well as this, both second and third-level students are set to benefit from new schemes — including the free book scheme being extended to Leaving Cert students, covering all of primary and secondary school. Third-level students will also benefit from the Budget, with €500 set to be cut from third-level fees, as well as an increase in Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) grants. Those who are renting or owning a house will see a number of benefits — namely the energy credits worth €250, which will be paid in two installments of €125 before and after Christmas. The renter’s credit will also increase from €750 to €1,000, while the higher rate of income tax will see the minimum threshold raise to €44,000 per year. The Help to Buy scheme, which will help first-time buyers get a home, will also be extended until 2029. Despite calls from Fuels for Ireland not to increase carbon taxes, an increase means that prices of petrol and diesel will increase by 2c to an average of €1.75 per litre — making Ireland the most expensive country in the EU to fill up the car with diesel. ""The planned carbon tax increase will catapult Ireland to the top of the EU’s fuel price rankings, making us the most expensive country in Europe for diesel and one of the highest for petrol,"" Kevin McPartlan, Fuels for Ireland CEO, said ahead of the budget. Minister Jack Chambers added that the €14.1billion windfall from the Apple judgment will be used to address ""housing, energy water, and transport infrastructure."" ""We will invest in a future that ensures Ireland is a country and a society that is fair, equitable, and a beacon of hope, prosperity, and progress,"" Mr. Chambers said. ""This government, through successive budgets, has supported the individuals, families, and businesses who played an integral part in ensuring our economy is in such a strong position today. Government responded as it should have, with the unity of purpose, and provided extraordinary support to deal with all of the challenges we faced. ""I believe Budget 2025 puts in place the policies and measures to continue this positive trajectory and to ensure that all our people see a promising and hopeful future in this country. ""For many years, we’ve urged the Government to take meaningful steps by establishing an expert group to review fuel taxation. The relentless rise in fuel prices is not just unsustainable for consumers but counterproductive. Our recent survey confirms that 80% of motorists agree with the need for an urgent review."" Despite calls from restaurants and the hospitality sector to decrease the controversial VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%, both that and a decrease to 11% were rejected at the 11th hour. Despite VAT remaining the same, Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke said that this budget is ""very pro-business,"" and that businesses will receive a significant ""power up"" cash payment. ""Cash is the lifeblood of our small family businesses and that’s what we will be doing, giving them cash before the New Year and that will be a significant help to them,"" Minister Burke said. ""Obviously other measures like improving discretionary income for citizens right across the economy."" *This article was originally published on Extra.ie.",0,1
2024/10/1,"Why is the Irish border where it is? Northern Ireland wasn’t always destined to be a six-county state. Everything you need to know on how the Irish border was created. In 1922 Sir Austen Chamberlain described the Irish border as “a compromise, and like all compromises is illogical and indefensible.” A century on many Irish people would argue the border remains just that when pressed for their thoughts on the snaking line that cleaves Ireland into two parts. Countless others would disagree and could tick off the names of relatives wounded or killed in its defense. For most the line scratched out by bureaucrats in the early 20th century probably doesn’t bother them much; it’s there and that is that. The idea of an Ireland disjointed and administered out of two capitals was first mooted seriously in the 19th century when Home Rule was advocated by Prime Minister William Gladstone. Then, as now, rule from Dublin was fiercely resisted by most Protestants in Ulster. “Home Rule means Roman Rule,” cried loyalists amid fears that a legislature in Catholic Dublin would mean discrimination against Protestants. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Where once Presbyterians in Ulster opposed the union with Great Britain now they were its staunchest defenders; not only did they fear Home Rule would ultimately mean independence but they worried that a Dublin Government would be dominated by farmers with little care for the north’s more industrial economy. Ulster, they argued, with its growing manufacturing base and trading links with the world had more in common economically with Britain than the South. Ireland and the United Kingdom. While Charles Stewart Parnell refused to “give up a single Irishman” in his quest for a Home Rule Parliament, many of his opponents concluded that the division of the island was the only way to satisfy two so exclusive and yet fiercely held demands. The Home Rule debate had sowed the seeds of partition and it would not be long before they blossomed. In 1912 the Liberal Party was in power again and attempted one last role of the dice to settle the Irish Question once and for all. But the Third Home Rule Bill roused passions that made the opposition to the first two seem mild and dignified. Irish Party legislators John Dillon and Joseph Devlin intransigently argued that the whole 32 counties of Ireland be placed under the authority of a Dublin Parliament: ""No concessions for Ulster, Ulster will have to follow,"" the pair insisted. The result was the Ulster Covenant, signed first on September 28, 1912, by Sir Edward Carson with a silver pen and a flourish at Belfast City Hall. In total 471,414 men and women vowed to use “all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland. And in the event of such a Parliament being forced upon us, we further solemnly and mutually pledge ourselves to refuse to recognize its authority.” Love Irish history? Share your favorite stories with other history buffs in the IrishCentral History Facebook group. Bluffing they were not and in January 1913 Carson moved a motion in the British Parliament that would have exempted all nine Ulster counties from any Home Rule Parliament. Irish Party leader John Redmond reluctantly responded by suggesting that each county is given a plebiscite allowing it to opt-in or out of Home Rule, all excluded counties would remain governed directly by Westminster. While Carson had the support of the opposition Conservative party leader Andrew Bonar Law, the governing Liberal Party was inclined to Redmond’s position and suggested that Antrim, Down, Derry and Armagh would be exempted from Home Rule, whilst Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Tyrone and Fermanagh would be ruled by Dublin. Pressing his luck, Redmond suggested the nationalist majority towns Newry and Derry – in the unionist majority counties of Down and Derry – also be given to Dublin; his suggestion was rejected. Yet still, hardline unionists felt threatened and concluded the only way they could guarantee Home Rule would not be “imposed” was through an armed militia. The formation of the Ulster Volunteers in 1912 lit a similar fuse of militarism in the nationalist community and the result was the Irish Volunteers, who pledged themselves to defending the right of any Home Rule Parliament to govern the country. Ireland seemed to be marching resolutely towards an orange-on-green civil war and as the events of one fateful day on March 20, 1914, made clear, the almighty British Empire would be powerless to prevent it. The Curragh Incident, as it came to be called, was the most serious mutiny in Britain’s recent history; with the Home Rule Bill soon to finish its final meandering journey through Parliament, General Sir Arthur Paget informed his officers that action against the Ulster Volunteers might soon be necessary. Any men from the province would be allowed to take a tactical vacation, anyone else not willing to take up arms would be dismissed. Some 60 officers out of 70 made clear in no uncertain terms that they would rather resign than take up arms against the Ulstermen and that was that. Britain’s authority over the island, having frayed thin for so many years, looked all of a sudden completely impotent. If it could not even use British Army to enforce British law. Did the government in Ireland even exist? Ultimately, military force against the UVF was averted when in June that year Fermanagh, Tyrone, Armagh, Derry, Down and Antrim were given exemptions from the act. Unionists on the wrong side of the border reluctantly accepted the terms of the act to avoid civil war and with the tacit admission that “the existence of the Empire was at stake.” Where once Carson had vociferously argued for the exclusion of Ulster in its entirety, the existence of large Catholic majorities in Cavan, Monaghan, and Donegal meant the inclusion of such counties threatened the long-term vitality of a northern state, with the risk that one day the whole of Ulster would vote to join the southern state. Reluctantly unionists concluded three limbs had to be amputated to save the body. Thomas Moles, an MP for Titanic's home city of Belfast, morosely pondered, “In a sinking ship, with the lifeboats sufficient for only two-thirds of the ship’s company, were all to condemn themselves to death because all could not be saved?” This article was originally published in Ireland of the Welcomes magazine. Subscribe now! The outbreak of the First World War that August saw the Act given Royal Assent but shelved for the duration of the conflict. At a time when the government’s focus had to be squarely on winning the ‘Great War for Civilization,’ there was little time for constitutional innovation. Fate intervened in the meantime and when Germany surrendered to Britain, Westminster found another conflict had broken out, this time in the United Kingdom’s western appendage. The Irish War of Independence raged for two full years until the two sides agreed on an uneasy truce. Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith were dispatched to London to thrash out a peace treaty that would lead to Collins’ death and the partition of the island. The Anglo-Irish Treaty was narrowly ratified by Dáil Éireann, but the provision that Ireland be partitioned was an absolute deal-breaker for many legislators, even if the blow of division was couched in the promise that a Boundary Commission would review exactly where the border should lie. Collins argued that partition was only temporary and pleaded, “We all known Ulster cannot survive without southern Ireland.” Map of Ireland. However, not all legislators thought partition necessarily a bad thing; Cork Deputy John Walsh controversially argued that Sinn Féin’s revolution “was only a partial one… I came to the conclusion that if we included the… West British cutthroats… They would again influence our national policy. The Irish language and all that pertained to it would go by the board… and everything we have fought for through 800 years would be smashed to atoms and swallowed up in the British Empire.” The outbreak of Civil War following the independence of the Free State in 1922 meant the Commission would not meet until 1924. Fresh from dividing Upper Silesia following the Treaty of Versailles, a small group of British civil servants cast their eyes west to Ireland. Their boss, Richard Feetham, was a Welsh-born South African and had already produced one report for the British Government on constitutional reform in India. Joining him was Eoin MacNeill, then the Free State’s Minister for Education, and Joseph Fisher, a liberal unionist representing Northern Ireland. Now safely ensconced in power, Belfast unionists were determined to give “not one inch” to the Free State and refused to appoint someone to a body designed to reduce their territory; irritated, the British Government appointed the maverick Fisher to speak for Ulster. The Commission soon ran into problems when it became clear that the trio had very different ideas about the purpose of their work; McNeill wanted to see large transfers of nationalist Ulster to the Free State, Feetham hoped to tinker conservatively with the border and Fisher suggested that Belfast should annex Donegal on account of the county’s persistent poverty. “We ought to bear our share of the burden of congestion and misery, and Ulster can never be complete without Donegal. Donegal belongs to Derry, and Derry to Donegal… and a hostile ‘Afghanistan’ on our northwest frontier would be placed in safekeeping,” he argued. While this idea had some support among the Commission’s witnesses, ultimately it was a political nonstarter and Fisher was forced to content himself with a two-mile extension of the border into northeast Donegal. Love Irish history? Share your favorite stories with other history buffs in the IrishCentral History Facebook group. The outcome that would have most satisfied Dublin, namely the transfer of Catholic areas in Fermanagh, Tyrone, Armagh, Derry and Down was rejected that on the grounds that it “would gratify 258,617 persons and be contrary to the wishes of 205,528 others.” The rate of dissatisfaction was far too high for the Commission to recommend such drastic surgery. Thus, the tinkering began. East Donegal was for Ulster, but a proposal to give heavily Catholic Strabane in Tyrone was rejected – its hinterland was Protestant. A small sliver of Tyrone was to be gifted to Dublin but that part of the county still under British authority would still retain its Catholic majority. Fermanagh was treated with similar delicacy. “We may have to go pretty deep in places,” Fisher concluded and 70 square miles were mapped into the southern state; crucially for nervous Protestant farmers, key floodgates would remain in Northern Ireland. The Commission eyed up north Monaghan where a few heavily Protestant parishes hugged the border but declined to transfer anything; reasoning that the adjacent parishes in Armagh were Catholic. But further to the county’s south, a ten square mile block was scalloped into the north. Only in Armagh was anything approaching radical change proposed; 14,678 citizens were to be given to Dublin, of whom 13,859 were Catholic. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The fate of Newry was hotly contested; nationalists contended that as three-quarters of its population were Catholics it would shatter the credibility of the Commission were its transferral not proposed. Feetham however inclined to the view that the town was a commercial satellite of Belfast and ruled it would remain in the north. Overall 282 square miles were to be given to the Free State and 78 to the north; 31,000 people – of whom close to 28,000 of whom were Catholic – would find themselves under Dublin rule and some 8,000 citizens would be given to Belfast – of whom nearly 3,000 were Catholic. The territory of Northern Ireland would drop by 3.7% and the population by 1.8%. Fisher was at pains to assure Carson that Northern Ireland would, “remain a solid and close-knit unit… somewhat trimmed on the edge… No center of even secondary importance goes over, and with Derry, Strabane, Enniskillen, Newtownbutler, Keady, and Newry in safekeeping, your handiwork will survive. If anybody had suggested twelve months ago that we could have kept so much I would have laughed at him.” When the proposals were leaked to the media in November they provoked outrage in the south. The humiliation of losing parts of Donegal and Monaghan in return for a minimal gain elsewhere was too much for Dublin and MacNeill tendered his resignation from the Commission. There was speculation that the Government could lose a motion of no confidence in the Dáil and that Éamon de Valera could be swept to office in a republican backlash. A meeting between the two remaining commissioners and the Prime Ministers of Britain, Northern Ireland and the Free State was arranged. Joined by Winston Churchill, who was then serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer, the commissioners were told in no uncertain terms that their report was best “burnt or buried”. Despite their protests that certain anomalies needed to be fixed the rare unanimity between the three governments meant the report was a nonstarter; the six counties would remain united.

Announcg the webinar, the AOH said: ""The British Labour Party and new Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged to 'repeal and replace' the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act which was imposed by the Conservatives despite overwhelming opposition from Irish victims’ relatives, human rights campaigners, the Irish government, and all major six county political parties. ""Now, three months after taking office, there are growing concerns that the new Labour government will keep the Independent Commission on Reconciliation and Information Retrieval (ICRIR) created by the Tories to replace legacy mechanisms that were bringing justice to victims."" The AOH's statement continued: ""The issue of legacy justice is at a critical point. ""Throughout the 1969-98 conflict, hundreds of families, particularly in killings committed directly by or in collusion with British crown forces, were systematically denied truth and justice about the murder of their loved ones. ""The Good Friday Agreement promised victims’ relatives a new beginning and the Stormont House Agreement offered legacy mechanisms which appeared capable of delivering justice. ""Despite delaying tactics and denials, victims’ relatives began to uncover the truth through proceedings such as the Ballymurphy Massacre Inquest, or Ombudsman Investigations such as Loughinisland, Operation Greenwich or Operation Achille, or in civil actions. ""The Conservative Party government responded by devising the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act, and creating the ICRIR Commission to replace legitimate independent investigations, mandated by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and despite the opposition of victims’ relatives, the Irish government and Irish political parties.

Pola Cairns Pola Cairns’ two brothers - Gerard (22) and Rory (18) - were gunned down by Mid-Ulster UVF loyalists near Craigavon on October 30, 1993, following frequent sectarian taunts and harassment by the RUC and the RIR, the former Ulster Defense Regiment. A BBC documentary revealed that several of those involved in planning and carrying out these murders were RUC special branch and/or British intelligence agents. The Cairns family believes the Legacy Act and ICRIR Commission were created to shut down all routes to truth and justice because of the campaign for an inquiry into the activities of the Mid-Ulster UVF during the 1990’s. Padraig O’Muirigh Civil rights lawyer Padraig O’Muirigh has represented families in the Ballymurphy Massacre Inquest and many other legacy cases.

2024/10/10,"""The world is not doing enough"" to end violence in Middle East, Taoiseach says in US Taoiseach Simon Harris said in the US that Ireland relives its own ""traumatic past"" when it watches - with horror - the violence in the Middle East. Taoiseach Simon Harris again raised the matter of the situation in the Middle East during the second day of his US visit on Thursday, October 10. ""In Ireland, we believe in bringing hope and history together,"" Harris said during his remarks at Georgetown University in Washington, DC on Thursday. ""We believe that peace is always possible. We have to. ""And when we speak about the terrible conflict ongoing in the Middle East, we're doing so from a perspective of watching our own history reflected back at us and remembering our own story of suffering. ""It is the faces of our children that we see crying out to be saved. ""It is the voices of our ancestors that we hear rebuking us for not doing more. ""Every day, we watch with absolute horror as the innocent are punished for the sins of others, and we relive, over and over and over again, our own country's traumatic past. ""I have repeatedly, and do so again today, condemned the barbaric terrorist attacks which took place just one year ago in Israel. ""But the world can no longer watch as the lives of innocent children and people are maimed, killed, and threatened daily. ""The world can no longer ignore the piercing cries of countless children. ""And Ireland will always be honest with its friends. The world is not doing enough to bring this violence, devastation, and bloodshed to an end. ""It's no longer enough to just say you want a ceasefire; every lever at our disposal must be pulled in the name of peace."" A post shared by Simon Harris (@simonharristd) Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The Taoiseach spoke at Georgetown University the day after he had a private, bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden at The White House. The Department of the Taoiseach had announced in September that Harris had accepted an invitation from the White House to visit in October to mark 100 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and the US. The original plans included an event - understood to be a reception to mark the centenary in the Rose Garden at the White House - after the meeting between the two leaders, but President Biden nixed it on Monday in light of Hurricane Milton's imminent landfall in Florida. Following his engagement with the President on Wednesday, the Taoiseach made it clear that the Middle East was a large part of their meeting, which reportedly lasted just under an hour. The meeting took place not long after Biden spoke with the Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu. Harris told reporters on Wednesday evening: ""It's for the President to speak to his conversation with the Prime Minister of Israel, but I'm very clear after my conversation with President Biden that when he spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu today that it was a very serious conversation of substance about bringing about a cessation of violence. ""Obviously, I made it clear to the President, the Irish view - it's a view I make clear in public and private - that all countries should be doing everything within their capacity to stop the violence. ""Of course, in relation to the United States, that does involve the issue of arming and providing arms and munitions. ""But, I have to say quite honestly, I've left the Oval Office clear in the view that President Biden had a very important conversation with the Prime Minister of Israel today and I really hope that that yields significant results because the current situation - the killings, the bombings, the maimings - it cannot continue. It's utterly disproportionate. ""I again made the point to the President that Ireland, of all countries, knows that the only way you bring about peace is through dialogue and a political process.""",0,1

The media were provided with video clips and told by one of Mr. Harris’s advisers: ""I grabbed these [videos] on the QT. Feel free to use it as you please."" Simon Harris used one of his political advisers to video inside the Oval Office during his meeting with US President Joe Biden – after TV cameras were denied access to capture the ""closed event."" Mr. Harris, who has been dubbed the 'TikTok Taoiseach,' secured clearance to allow one of his special advisers to film the start of the meeting with President Biden. The meeting was listed on Mr. Biden’s schedule as closed to the press, meaning neither US nor Irish TV networks were permitted to film what was a landmark event for the Taoiseach. With a general election approaching, the Fine Gael leader said he would not use the footage or promote Fine Gael in a bid to capitalize on the importance of the meeting. Asked about what he would say to people who criticised the trip as a ""glorified photo opportunity,"" the Taoiseach said that it was an ""absolutely absurd thing to say.""

A post shared by Simon Harris (@simonharristd) It was Mr. Harris’s first meeting with the outgoing US President as Taoiseach after he took over as leader of Fine Gael and the country in April. The White House also had an official photographer and videographer present at the meeting but did not publish or circulate any video footage. On behalf of the Irish contingent, one of Mr. Harris’s advisers – who had travelled with the Taoiseach and his Government press secretary Chris Donoghue – was tasked with taking video footage from inside the meeting. Members of the Irish media who travelled to Washington were not granted access to the Oval Office during the meeting. Instead, the media were provided with the video clips and told by one of Mr. Harris’s advisers: ""I grabbed these [videos] on the QT. Feel free to use it as you please."" The adviser also told members of the press he was not going to be permitted to go into the Oval Office, but was later granted entry. The Government Press Secretary said that he ""didn’t know"" why this adviser claimed he got the footage on the ""QT"" but insisted that did not reflect the reality of the situation and that the adviser was part of the delegation. White House sources said the adviser was given clearance as an ""embassy videographer,"" despite him not being attached to the embassy. The only other Irish officials in the room were John Callinan, secretary-general at the Department of the Taoiseach, Joanne Lonergan, the Taoiseach’s joint chief of staff and the Irish Ambassador to the US Geraldine Byrne Nason. Mr. Biden was joined by his senior adviser John McCarthy and the US Ambassador to Ireland Claire Cronin.

A video montage of the Taoiseach in the White House was uploaded yesterday morning on his TikTok and Instagram social media accounts. The Taoiseach defended his adviser capturing the content, saying that ""political advisers can also take videos"" and that he was ""obviously allowed to have some of my own people at a meeting with the President of the US."" The adviser travels frequently with the Taoiseach and despite being a political adviser regularly creates social media content. One Government source said that his presence as an ""adviser"" when being tasked with ""filming the Taoiseach"" annoyed some diplomats on other foreign trips. The bilateral meeting between the Taoiseach and Mr. Biden was the centrepiece of a series of engagements in Washington DC to mark 100 years of Irish-United States diplomatic relations which was scaled back due to Hurricane Milton making landfall in Florida. Pressed again about the importance of meeting with President Biden and those who criticised it as merely a photo opportunity, Mr. Harris said: ""What I’d say to them is, find me one other European prime minister who doesn’t want to spend nearly an hour talking to the president of the United States of America in the Oval Office about the undocumented Irish, about the legacy act, about Gaza the Middle East, like the safety of our peacekeepers. ""Remember, this week, on Monday, I was able to speak directly to the president of the United States of America and to ask him to intervene and assist,"" he said. The Taoiseach said that there are similar criticisms made about the annual St. Patrick’s Day visit but that no Taoiseach of Ireland would ever turn down the chance to meet with a US President given the benefits it can bring. ""They said the same with St Patrick’s Day, the main opposition party, in fairness, didn’t take that approach, but there are some that have that view. They articulated that view of the Dáil before I headed off on this trip. ""But I’m not sure any moment in our history, and not sure of any moment in the future where a Taoiseach of Ireland, whoever he or she is, would not wish to take the opportunity to engage with the United States,"" he said. *This article was originally published on Extra.ie.",0,1
2024/10/11,"Ireland and the US began diplomatic relations 100 years ago this week Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs is marking 100 years of relations with the US with an overview of the two countries' intertwined past. 2024 marks the 100 year anniversary of diplomatic relations between Ireland and the US. On October 7, 1924, Professor Timothy Smiddy presented credentials to President Calvin Coolidge, becoming Ireland's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the US. Ambassador Smiddy was the first diplomatic agent officially appointed by Ireland, then a newly independent State. The US was one of the first nations to recognize the fledgling nation of Ireland. As well as being a landmark moment in Ireland’s relationship with the US, it was also a crucial moment in cementing Ireland’s independence and self-determination. Today, over 30 million Americans, 9% of the population of the US, claim Irish heritage. Marking the centenary of relations, Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs says: ""The relationship between our two countries is based not just on common ancestral bonds but also on shared values and strong economic ties."" Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs has compiled this overview of the high points of the enduring relationship between Ireland and the US: More than any other nation, the US has provided unstinting friendship and support throughout Ireland’s existence as a free and democratic state. The relationship between the two countries is based not just on common ancestral ties but, crucially, on shared human values. The Irish played a vital role in the American War of Independence. Three of the signatories to the 1776 Declaration of Independence were Irish-born, and many others of Irish descent. The Declaration’s powerful assertions of rights and liberties are clearly echoed in the 1916 Proclamation of Irish Independence. Irish and American flags.

The relationship is still growing. Ireland hosts a larger number of American ‘study abroad’ students than any other country – almost 12,000 every year - while close to 8,000 Irish citizens travel to the US every year on exchange programmes.

Irish Aid and USAID have worked together on strategically important development projects. Irish and American values are most vividly expressed in their shared commitment to multilateralism, deriving from a deep belief in the shared humanity of people everywhere, and the interdependence of all nations for security and human progress. Today, Ireland and the US are partners and colleagues at the United Nations as well as multiple other international organisations that express their shared commitment to human development, peace, and prosperity. Throughout the difficult times of conflict followed by peacebuilding, America has been a steadfast friend to the entire island of Ireland. In 2023, Ireland celebrated the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement with its American friends who ""brought not just statecraft but also a deep understanding of the complexity of relationships on the island of Ireland."" For the US, the Agreement is a pillar of foreign policy and an issue of bipartisan consensus. Bertie Ahern, George Mitchell, and Tony Blair with the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.

More than 900 US-owned firms have their European headquarters in Ireland, providing 180,000 jobs. 100 years on from the appointment of Ambassador Smiddy, Ireland has an extensive diplomatic footprint with a network of nine active diplomatic missions and Honorary Consuls in 11 cities across the US.

Taoiseach Simon Harris spoke with President of Israel Isaac Herzog on Monday, October 14 amid rising concerns about the safety of UNIFIL peacekeepers. In Israel, much like in Ireland, the role of the President is mostly ceremonial. Executive power in Israel is with the Prime Minister, currently Benjamin Netanyahu. ""Today I spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog to relay the Government's serious concern about the deteriorating situation in southern Lebanon and to emphasise the Government's expectation that UNIFIL's role and mandate be fully respected at all times,"" Harris said on social media after the call. ""I again emphasised that the security of Irish peacekeepers serving in the region is paramount,"" he said. Ireland contributes 370 troops to the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL), which overall consists of 10,058 peacekeepers from 50 countries. The Taoiseach continued: ""The deliberate firing at UNIFIL posts is an outrageous and totally unacceptable breach of international law, and a cause of the deepest concern to the Irish people, especially the families of the Irish Defence Forces personnel serving in Lebanon ""The scale of the humanitarian catastrophe is unimaginable and that children and civilians are starving and dying is reprehensible.""

2024/10/14,"Taoiseach Simon Harris defends reopening of Irish embassy in Iran Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris stressed that having diplomatic relations is ""not the same as agreeing with a country."" Taoiseach Simon Harris has defended the decision to reopen the Irish embassy in Tehran, stressing the importance of maintaining diplomatic relations with Iran. It comes after the Irish Mail on Sunday last week revealed senior Government figures were furious at the timing of a decision to allow ambassador-designate Laoise Moore to take up residence in Iran - just days before the rogue Islamic state fired hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel. Ministers also said they believed the decision to reopen an embassy in Iran – a decision made years ago – was on ‘ice’ due to increasing disquiet over re-establishing diplomatic relations with a country that sponsors terrorism and has received international condemnation for its treatment of women. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Asked about the reopening of the embassy during his trip to Washington last week, Mr. Harris stressed the benefits of ongoing diplomatic relations with Iran. He said the safety of staff at the Irish embassy is of ‘paramount’ importance. ""The safety of any diplomat or local staff that would work in any structure would, of course, be a factor in terms of deciding when to physically open a building, where to do it, how to keep them secure,"" the Taoiseach said. The embassy in Tehran closed in 2012 due to the impact of the financial crisis. In 2021, then-foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney announced the re-establishment of an Irish diplomatic presence in Iran. That year, a chargé d’affaires was posted to Tehran, joined later by other staff. Ms. Moore arrived in the city at the start of last month but has yet to be offered a date to formally present her credentials to Iranian officials. The Department of Foreign Affairs has insisted it is normal for ambassadors to have to wait for weeks or months before a date is offered to formally present credentials. It added: ""This does not preclude the ambassador-designate managing the work of the mission over the intervening period. ""In this instance, a date for our ambassador-designate in Tehran to present her credentials has not yet been fixed."" The department said the full embassy team is now in place and the embassy is in operation. Mr. Harris said there was a misconception that diplomatic relations with Iran were only being established now, adding: ""They’ve already existed – the question now is the infrastructure you put in place on the ground and, of course, the security situation in the region will be paramount in our mind"" And he stressed that having diplomatic relations is ""not the same as agreeing with a country."" The Taoiseach added: ""I mean, we have diplomatic relations with Russia – we utterly deplore the actions of Russia. We have diplomatic relations with Israel when I’m very clear Israel, in my view, is continuing to engage in a war on children in Gaza."" ""So, we can have diplomatic relations with a country and continue to call out that country."" The Irish embassy is operating in space provided by the embassy of Germany – with a view to opening a premises early next year. Meanwhile, Mr. Harris also warned Israel must stop firing on United Nations peacekeepers. His comments come after Israeli troops fired on UN headquarters in southern Lebanon, injuring two peacekeepers for the second time in as many days. The Taoiseach will call for an immediate ceasefire in the region at the European Council. Mr. Harris discussed the Israeli activity on the Blue Line with US President Joe Biden in the Oval Office on Wednesday. He said the leaders agreed the ‘Blue Helmets’ must ""always be afforded full protection."" In a statement, Mr. Harris said: ""Israel must stop firing on UN peacekeepers serving with Unifil in Lebanon."" Tánaiste Micheál Martin called on the international community to pressure Israel to stop what he described as its ‘reckless and intimidatory’ actions. *This article was originally published on Extra.ie.

2024/10/16,"Ireland ""will not wait for everybody in Europe"" on trade in OPT, Taoiseach says Ireland could move unilaterally from the EU to suspend trade with Israel on products originating from the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). Taoiseach Simon Harris said on Wednesday, October 16 that Ireland ""will not wait for everybody in Europe to move on the issue of trade in the Occupied Palestinian Territories [OPT]."" The Taoiseach was speaking with reporters in Brussels ahead of the first summit meeting between the EU and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman. He will also attend a meeting of the European Council on Thursday. Ahead of the meetings, Harris said on Wednesday: ""I'll be continuing my work that I've undertaken with [Spain's] Prime Minister Sanchez in terms of the importance of the European Union using every lever at its disposal to help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. ""And, of course, it's important to say Europe has not yet used every lever at its disposal. ""It is entirely appropriate that the EU Israel Association Agreement would be reviewed. That is not yet the majority position of the European Union. I will be making that point that we should review that Agreement. It's absolutely clear view of the people of Ireland and the government of Ireland. ""But I'd also be making the point that Ireland now, in the context of the ICJ advisory opinion of July, will not wait for everybody in Europe to move on the issue of trade in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. ""And next week, my government will receive formal advices from our own Attorney General as to what we may be able to do in this area because the context has very much changed since the ICJ advisory opinion has been given in July. ""In fact, I would go so far as to say it is now no longer a discretion on countries that support the ICJ it is an obligation to take actions to help give effects to that opinion."" According to The Journal, the Taoiseach went on to say that he does not believe his comments would cause a further divide - or even some confrontation - between Ireland, the European Commission, and other leaders. “I’m not here to have controversial confrontation with anybody,"" he said. ""In fact, I’m here to take steps that can help bring about peace and political dialog. ""I absolutely understand that trade is an EU competency. I absolutely support that reality.""

Harris was speaking two days after Prime Minister of Spain Pedro Sanchez called on the European Commission to take a stance on Spain and Ireland's joint request, issued in February, to ""urgently review whether Israel is complying with its obligations to respect human rights in Gaza."" As the Taoiseach indicated in his comments to reporters in Brussels on Wednesday, the request is in a new context following the ICJ ruling in July that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the régime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law. The Taoiseach was also speaking as the debate surrounding the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 reignited in the Oireachtas. The Bill, introduced by Senator Frances Black in 2018, aims to ban trade between Ireland and Israel’s illegal settlements in Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Bill has been stalled at committee stage in the Dáil since 2020. On Wednesday, when asked about the Bill, TD Paschal Donohoe, Ireland's Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, said in the Dail: ""The Tánaiste, Taoiseach and Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, received a briefing on this matter at the start of this week from the Attorney General. ""My understanding is that the Cabinet will be briefed on this issue as soon as next week. We will receive an update on it. ""I am sure after that, the Tánaiste, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, will be able to outline if a further course of action is needed.

2024/10/16,"Congressman vows to hold Britain’s ""feet to the fire"" on Northern Ireland Legacy Act Rep Brian Fitzpatrick reiterated the bipartisan effort to hold the British Labour Government to their commitment to repeal the Northern Ireland Legacy Act. US Representative Brian Fitzpatrick said that he and other Congressmen are ready to ""hold Britain’s feet to the fire” to make the new Labour government in the UK keep its promise to repeal and replace the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act. Fitzpatrick made the comments during a live webinar hosted by the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) and moderated by Martin Galvin last Saturday, October 12. The Congressman spoke after hearing from Troubles victims’ sister Pola Cairns, civil rights lawyer Padraig O’Murigh, Relatives for Justice CEO Mark Thompson, and TD Peadar Tóibín. In its party manifesto, the British Labour Party vowed to ""repeal and replace"" the Legacy Act, which the party says ""denies justice to the families and victims of the troubles."" However, plans are now underway to repeal only portions of the Act and, controversially, keep the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR). Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! When asked about his thoughts regarding the British Labour Government continuing the ICRIR, Congressman Fitzpatrick said: ""We're going to hold their feet to the fire. ""The British - the United Kingdom - needs the United States on a whole host of fronts and we're going to call them out for this, that's the bottom line. ""The quote-unquote Legacy Bill became law despite unanimous opposition from the political parties in Northern Ireland. ""It denies justice to victims and families impacted by the Troubles. It also provides amnesty for crimes committed by armed forces members that served in Northern Ireland."" Fitzpatrick highlighted how the Irish government has issued legal proceedings against the UK, arguing that the Legacy Act is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. He went on to note how the British Labour Party, in its party manifesto, pledged to repeal and replace the Legacy Act if elected. Labour ultimately won in a landslide. ""Keir Starmer is now the Prime Minister today [and] the Labour government has not fulfilled its promise to dismantle the ICRIR which was established by the Act,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""Interested stakeholders, including my brothers and sisters in the AOH and the LAOH, obviously we're very concerned that Labour now intends to retain and rebrand, to use their words, this Commission rather than uphold its promise to repeal and replace. ""We signed a bipartisan letter in July of 2024 reiterating our opposition to the Troubles Act, calling on Prime Minister Starmer to fulfill the promise to repeal and replace with the new Labour government. We have to prioritize reconciliation as it was established by the Good Friday Agreement. ""The entire island of Ireland, they have to be able to choose their own destiny, particularly on the issue of legacy."" Fitzpatrick continued: ""What is the strategy going forward? The British government needs the United States and depends on the United States for a whole host of areas, and we will be bringing them into our office, once again, telling them that as Irish American legislators from both sides of the aisle - myself, Brendan Boyle, Bill Keating, Dave Joyce, Mike Kelly - we're going to sit down with them and say, 'Listen, this is going to be very damaging to our relations should you choose to go down this path. You made a commitment, many would argue that you won, in part, because of that commitment you made, so now you have to keep your promise.' ""We are, of course, open to suggestions, but you know that we stand ready to do whatever is necessary. ""And the beauty of this is that they are going to be hearing from both Democrats and Republicans in the House and in the Senate on this and that will clearly deliver a message to them."" Fitzpatrick added: ""I do believe that if we really amp the pressure that we can have a positive result here. ""The UK, they only have so much capital they can spend on issues. The question for them is, are they willing to jeopardize our relationship with them over this? ""I would hope the answer is no to that.""",0,1
2024/10/17,"Safe Access Zones now in effect in Ireland - how do they work? Ireland's Department of Health says Safe Access Zones ensure that ""people who access termination of pregnancy services can do so in safety and with dignity."" Ireland’s Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly announced on Thursday, October 17 that the Health (Termination of Pregnancy Services) (Safe Access Zones) Act 2024 has come into effect. From Thursday, Safe Access Zones are in operation within 100 metres of the entrance or exit to premises where a general practitioner, obstetrician, or gynaecologist provides services. This includes general practitioner clinics and family planning clinics as well as acute hospitals. The Department of Health says the law ensures that people who access termination of pregnancy services can do so in safety and with dignity, without fear of influence or intimidation. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Minister Donnelly said on Thursday: ""I am today confirming that this hugely important legislation has come into effect. At its core is the need to support and protect people who need to access termination of pregnancy services. ""Patients who require these services are now legally protected from unsolicited influence, intimidation and pressure with a 100-metre zone of relevant healthcare premises. ""At a time when they are most in need of empathy and consideration, this law provides them with privacy and security. ""Getting to this point has been a long process with extensive engagement with a range of stakeholders. I’m very pleased that we have reached this milestone in providing people with protections they deserve at a time when they need it most. I would like to thank all those involved in getting the legislation to this point."" Within Safe Access Zones, it is illegal to carry out certain activities that are intended to obstruct a person’s access to or exit from where a General Practitioner or/and gynaecologist/obstetrician provide services. The Zones also apply to the entrances and exits to acute hospital campuses. Activities aimed at influencing a person’s decision in relation to termination of pregnancy services are also prohibited within the Zones. This includes distributing leaflets or displaying graphic images or coffins, photographing a person accessing services or repeatedly approaching or following them. If a person carries out certain illegal activities within a Safe Access Zone, such as obstructing a person’s access, or attempting to influence a person’s decision in relation to termination of pregnancy services, they will first receive a Garda warning. If, after receiving the warning, they continue to engage in prohibited conduct, they will be deemed to have committed an offence. A person who is charged with an offence under the Health (Termination of Pregnancy Services)(Safe Access Zones)Act 2024 may be liable to a fine and/or a term of imprisonment of up to six months. Those who are found guilty of repeat offences may face harsher penalties. These penalties are in line with similar offences in other legislation. If a protest march incidentally passes through a Safe Access Zone, the protest will not be prohibited provided it is not targeting specific healthcare facilities. The legislation can apply to a person’s private property if it falls within a Safe Access Zone and borders a public place. For example, a person will not be permitted to protest against termination of pregnancy services in their garden or doorway if it is within a Safe Access Zone and next to a public place. The law provides an exception in order to ensure that people providing healthcare services are not impacted in their work. For example, a healthcare provider may provide medical advice to a patient that they should not have a termination. This is not deemed to be illegal. Protests for or against termination services that take place within 100 metres of the entrances or exits to the Houses of the Oireachtas are not prohibited under the legislation, regardless of whether they fall within a Safe Access Zone, provided they are not targeting a specific healthcare facility. There is also an exception for activity within a place of worship. For example, a religious sermon intended to influence people in relation to termination of pregnancy services will not be prohibited, as long as it takes place inside the place of worship. This exception does not apply to the grounds outside a place of worship.",0,1
2024/10/2,"""Ireland’s never afraid to speak our view,"" Taoiseach says ahead of US visit Simon Harris said ahead of his meeting with Joe Biden that he's “proud of the tradition of taoisigh and presidents being able to engage on issues."" Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris is due to meet with US President Joe Biden at The White House next week to mark 100 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Harris accepted an invitation to meet Biden at the White House in October, the Department of the Taoiseach announced on September 24. Ahead of his US visit, Harris indicated he won't ""shy away from"" potentially difficult topics - especially concerning the Middle East - with the outgoing President. (The exact date of the Taoiseach's visit to the US hasn't been confirmed, with The Irish Times noting last week that ""it is normal White House protocol to only publish presidential diaries a week at a time."" However, Harris told the Irish Times on September 25 that his visit would be in ""two weeks."") Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! “I’m proud of the diplomatic relations between Ireland and the United States of America, and I believe the overwhelming majority of people in this country are too,"" Harris told reporters in Dublin on Wednesday, October 2, according to the PA. “I’m also proud of the tradition of taoisigh and presidents being able to engage on issues too. “But you also speak the truth to your friends. And Ireland’s never afraid to speak our view. And I’m not afraid of that either. We speak the truth. We speak up for our foreign policy. “We have an independent foreign policy, and our independent foreign policy is very clear in relation to what should happen in the Middle East.” Not long after becoming Taoiseach earlier this year, Harris announced in May that Ireland, in concert with Norway and Spain, would be formally recognizing Palestine as a state. Including Ireland, Norway, and Spain, 145 out of the 193 UN member states have now recognized a Palestinian state. The US is not among them. Harris said on Wednesday that he has “absolutely no doubt” that the Biden administration, ""led through the efforts of Secretary of State Antony Blinken,"" has been trying to bring about a ceasefire. ""I’ve no doubt the EU wants to see a ceasefire,"" Harris, who along with other Irish leaders has repeatedly called for a ceasefire, added. ""I can say all of that, though, and also say the next sentence – all of the efforts have been utterly ineffective to date, because we still don’t have a ceasefire. “So all of us – big countries, small countries, Europe, the United States – need to now say ‘what more can we do to bring the world back from the brink?’ “Because this is an extraordinarily dangerous moment. So, of course, we continue to engage with the United States. “Of course, we’re proud of the diplomatic links between the United States and Ireland, but we can also have, and do have, our own independent foreign policy, which we articulate at every possible opportunity.” The Department of the Taoiseach confirmed that Harris had accepted Biden's invitation to the White House on the same day that Biden addressed the US General Assembly in New York City last week. Harris was in attendance for the President's remarks Afterward, Harris said he welcomed the fact Biden referenced the need for a two-state solution to bring to an end the violence in the Middle East, the Irish Independent reports. However, Harris said he would not interfere in another country’s foreign policy when he was asked about the US continuing to supply weapons to Israel. “I wouldn't appreciate another country telling us our foreign policy or telling us how to proceed, but I know how hard President Biden has worked to try and bring about a ceasefire. I’ve spoken to him on the phone. I've seen how many times, Secretary Blinken has traveled to the region – an extraordinary number of times to have talks,” the Taoiseach said. Indeed, Harris and Biden discussed the ""need for an immediate ceasefire"" in Gaza during a phone call in June. During the call, Biden also congratulated Harris on becoming Taoiseach in the wake of Leo Varadkar's resignation. Varadkar announced his resignation in March less than a week after making headlines during his St. Patrick's Day engagements at the White House with President Biden. (In making the annual visit to the US this year, Varadkar defied Irish calls for a boycott due to the US response to the situation in Gaza.) On March 15, in front of cameras in The White House, Biden agreed with Varadkar when the Taoiseach called for a ceasefire. Varadkar told Biden: ""You'll know, my view [is] that we need to have a ceasefire as soon as possible to get food and medicine in ..."" Biden interjected: ""I agree."" Varadkar continued: ""...and to get hostages out. ""We need to talk about how we can make that happen and move toward a two-state solution, which I think is the only way we will have lasting peace and security.""",0,1

After much speculation, Taoiseach Simon Harris has confirmed that there will be a general election in Ireland before the end of 2024. As per Irish law, the same Dáil shall not continue for longer than five years from the date of its first meeting. As such, the current 33rd Dáil must be dissolved by the President of Ireland at the request of the Taoiseach no later than February 19, 2025, and a general election must be called by March 22, 2025. “There is no great mystery in relation to this and let me try to be helpful; there's going to be a general election this year,"" Harris told reporters in Dublin on Monday, according to The Irish Mirror. ""The Government is going to conclude its work. It's going to do that in an orderly manner."" The Taoiseach said he, Tánaiste Micheál Martin, and Minister Roderic O'Gorman - the three leaders of Ireland's current coalition government - have outlined a body of work to be completed before the end of this government. The work includes the Finance Bill, as well as setting housing targets. Harris said that the “lifetime of this Dáil is very limited."" He added that Fine Gael will contest the election as a “standalone political party” and would not have a “transfer pact” with Fianna Fáil or the Greens.

""I've been very clear though that I'm going to do it in a respectful manner,"" Harris said on Sunday. ""I have no wish to surprise my coalition colleagues."" While a date for Ireland's next general election has not been officially confirmed, TD Roderic O'Gorman, the head of Ireland's Green Party, said on Friday - before the Taoiseach announced that an election would likely be held this year - that he would like to see the election be held on November 29. “I think the 29th is the date to go,"" O'Gorman told reporters in Dublin on Friday, according to The Irish Examiner. “Probably now’s the time to give some degree of certainty to the Irish people in terms of the election date,” O’Gorman said. “I’ll be meeting with the two coalition leaders on Monday. What I’ll be saying to them is that I think we need to give clarity and I’ll be saying my preference is for a November election — 29th November.” Ireland's last general election was held on February 8, 2020. Fianna Fáil (38 seats), Sinn Féin (37 seats), and Fine Gael (35 seats) emerged as the top three parties; 80 seats are needed to form a coalition government. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael ultimately formed a coalition with The Green Party. Earlier this year, Ireland went to the polls for local, European, and Mayor of Limerick elections. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael won the most seats, though both parties lost seats from the last local elections in 2019.

2024/10/24,"""Desperate need for ceasefire in Gaza,"" Taoiseach tells US audience in Dublin Speaking to a largely American audience, Taoiseach Simon Harris said ""the world cannot ignore the cries of the children of Gaza any longer."" Taoiseach Simon Harris reiterated his calls for a ceasefire in Gaza on Thursday, October 24 while speaking at the US-Ireland Economic Summit which was hosted by the US Embassy at the US Ambassador to Ireland's residence in Dublin. Speaking after an introduction from the US Ambassador, the Taoiseach segued his commentary on the Irish and American relationship to matters in the Middle East. “As we celebrate 100 years of diplomatic relations between the US and Ireland, I do believe the future of our relationship is bright, I believe that it’s a partnership that can and must continue to thrive and continue to grow,"" the Taoiseach said toward the end of his roughly 15-minute address. “To do this, we require collaboration and a shared commitment to addressing the challenges of a rapidly changing global economy. “We’re living in an extraordinarily turbulent world. We’re living in a world where we’re witnessing a level of violent devastation, which must compel us to consider every possible action to bring it to an end, including ones that may not even normally be considered. “It’s always important to talk honestly to friends, and no matter what differing perspectives may exist, there can surely be unity on the desperate need for a ceasefire in Gaza, an end to violence in the Middle East, the release of all the hostages and the flow of humanitarian aid. “I know President Biden and I very much share this view, and I wish God’s speed to Secretary of State Blinken in his ongoing work and current efforts in the region. “But let’s be clear, we have to use every lever at the disposal of every country to stop the killing, to stop the violence. “Right across the world people speak different languages, but you know one language that is universal? The cry of a child, and the world cannot ignore the cries of the children of Gaza any longer.” The audience applauded the Taoiseach’s remarks. Overall, the Summit marked the 100 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and the US. In her opening remarks, US Ambassador Claire D. Cronin noted that Ireland and the US have a trade and investment relationship of more than $1 trillion. She said that while the US and Ireland face challenges that demand collaboration such as climate change, supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical shifts, these challenges present new opportunities for innovation. Other speakers at the US-Ireland Economic Summit are Ambassador Karen Kornbluh, White House Principal Deputy Chief Technology Officer; Mary Frances Repko, White House Deputy National Climate Advisor; Joseph Kennedy III, US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland for Economic Affairs; Mairead McGuinness, European Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services, and the Capital Markets Union; Steve Pagliuca, American private equity investor; and Shawn Henry, Chief Security Officer at CrowdStrike. The Taoiseach was speaking a day after Tánaiste Micheál Martin announced that Ireland's Occupied Territories Bill, introduced in 2018 and stalled in the Dáil since 2020, ""will be reviewed and amendments will be prepared in order to bring it into line with the Constitution and EU law."" The Bill aims to ban trade between Ireland and Israel’s illegal settlements in Occupied Palestinian Territories. Earlier this month, the Taoiseach offered similar comments regarding the Middle East while in the US, where he enjoyed a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at The White House. After his meeting in the Oval Office, Harris told reporters: ""Obviously, I made it clear to the President, the Irish view - it's a view I make clear in public and private - that all countries should be doing everything within their capacity to stop the violence. ""Of course, in relation to the United States, that does involve the issue of arming and providing arms and munitions. ""But, I have to say quite honestly, I've left the Oval Office clear in the view that President Biden had a very important conversation with the Prime Minister of Israel today and I really hope that that yields significant results because the current situation - the killings, the bombings, the maimings - it cannot continue. It's utterly disproportionate. ""I again made the point to the President that Ireland, of all countries, knows that the only way you bring about peace is through dialogue and a political process."" Al Jazeera reported on Wednesday that there have been at least 42,792 people, including nearly 16,765 children, killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023.

2024/10/28,"WATCH: Irish politician shares bizarre Taylor Swift endorsement deepfake The Taylor Swift deepfake shared by TD Michael Healy-Rae may have been a bit of craic, but it could spur serious conversations about misinformation. Michael Healy-Rae, an Independent TD for Co Kerry, has shared a deepfake video of Taylor Swift endorsing him for the upcoming Dail elections. Healy-Rae acknowledged that the video of Swift is indeed fake, but it didn't stop him from sharing it on X, along with a number of plays on Swift's song titles, on Monday, October 28. Some going to wake up to the news of an endorsement from Tay Tay herself. I mean haters will say it's fake (and they'd be right) but I'll just shake it off!

That's right, Best of luck, Michael."" Some of the people in Healy-Rae's replies suggested he take the post down. At the time of publication on Monday night, Healy-Rae's post drew just over 100 likes and more than 32k views. Swiftmania gripped Ireland earlier this summer when the popstar brought her record-breaking Eras Tour to Dublin for three sold-out shows. It is not believed that she ventured down to Healy-Rae's constituency in Co Kerry during her few days in Ireland. Independent TD for Kerry Michael Healy-Rae. Healy-Rae isn't the first politician to use a fake Swift endorsement. Across the pond, the popstar's likeness was also used by US Presidential nominee Donald Trump on his Truth Social platform in August. Sharing AI-generated images of young women wearing ""Swifties for Trump"" shirts, as well as a cartoon-like graphic of Swift dressed like Uncle Sam, Trump wrote: ""I accept!"" Unlike Healy-Rae, Trump did not say the pictures were fake, though they were. The Guardian reports that the Swift deepfakes shared by Trump can be traced back to the John Milton Freedom Foundation. Swift responded by endorsing the Harris-Walz ticket. In her endorsement, Swift said the fake images of her 'endorsing' Trump ""really conjured up my fears around AI, and the dangers of spreading misinformation."" Afterward, Trump about-faced, now famously posting ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!"" on Truth Social. The incident has spurred conversations about the uses of deepfakes in the scope of elections and whether or not they should be regulated. Back in Ireland, Coimisiún na Meán, Ireland's media regulator, issued updated guidance in June ahead of local elections regarding deepfakes: ""Given the increasing presence of audio and video content (including ‘deepfakes’) beinggenerated by artificial intelligence, broadcasters should take steps to manage these risks and minimise the potential for such content to make it on-air and mislead audiences."" Healy-Rae shared the Swift deepfake roughly a week after he shared another video on X that raised some eyebrows. In a post on October 21, the same day Taoiseach Simon Harris confirmed that there will be an election before the end of the year, Healy-Rae posted an animated clip of him sparring with the Taoiseach.

Taoiseach Simon Harris said in his own statement on Monday: “I strongly condemn the passage of legislation in the Israeli Knesset that forbids contact between the Israeli State and UNRWA. “If implemented, it will make it impossible for UNRWA to carry out its vital role across the region, including bringing humanitarian assistance to people in desperate need. ""It breaches Israel’s obligations in international law. UNRWA saves lives. If it cannot carry out its mission, people will die. “UNRWA works on a mandate given to it by the United Nations. All member states should condemn the legislation, call on Israel to repeal it immediately and redouble their support to UNRWA and the Palestinian people.” Tonight’s vote in Israel to ban UNRWA is disastrous and shameful. It’ll go down in history as the moment Israel voted to cut off an irreplaceable humanitarian pipeline to a humanitarian disaster zone. Tanaiste Micheál Martin also shared his condemnation, saying that the international community must stand against it. I strongly condemn the Israeli parliament’s approval of a law banning UNRWA from working in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Such a move would be unacceptable and have grave consequences for Palestinians. The international community must stand against this. Joint statement: pic.twitter.com/jvulIaop9l UNRWA, which operates in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, The Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, was established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1949. It has a mandate to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to registered Palestine refugees in the Agency’s area of operations. CNN reported on Monday that following the passing of the first law, Boaz Bismuth, a member of Likud, the architect of the bill, said: “Anyone that behaves like a terrorist has no rights in Israel…. UNRWA equals Hamas, period.” On Tuesday, António Guterres, the Secretary-General of the UN, said he is ""deeply concerned"" by the Knesset's adoption of the two laws regarding UNRWA. ""The implementation of these laws would be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for peace and security in the region as a whole,"" Guterres said in his statement. If implemented, the laws adopted today by the Knesset of Israel would likely prevent @UNRWA from continuing its essential work in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, with devastating consequences for Palestine refugees. I call on Israel to act consistently with its obligations… Meanwhile, Philippe Lazzarini, the UNRWA Commissioner-General, said in a letter on Tuesday to Philémon Yang, President of the UN's General Assembly, that the Knesset's adoption of the two laws ""in effect denies the protections and means essential for UNRWA to operate, forbidding Israeli state officials from contact with UNRWA or its representatives, and prohibiting UNRWA operations within what is referred to as the sovereign territory of the State of Israel."" Lazzarini continued: ""Dismantling UNRWA will have a catastrophic impact on the international response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It will also sabotage any chance of recovery."" He added: ""Today, even as we look into the faces of children in Gaza, some of whom we know will die tomorrow, the rules-based international order is crumbling in a repetition of the horrors that led to the establishment of the United Nations, and in violation of commitments to prevent their recurrence. The attacks on UNRWA are an integral part of this disintegration.""

Ahead of his US visit, Harris - who received a phone call from Biden in June after becoming Taoiseach - indicated he won't ""shy away from"" potentially difficult topics - especially concerning the Middle East - with the outgoing US President. “I’m proud of the diplomatic relations between Ireland and the United States of America, and I believe the overwhelming majority of people in this country are too,"" Harris told reporters in Dublin on Wednesday, according to the PA. “I’m also proud of the tradition of taoisigh and presidents being able to engage on issues too. “But you also speak the truth to your friends. And Ireland’s never afraid to speak our view. And I’m not afraid of that either. We speak the truth. We speak up for our foreign policy. “We have an independent foreign policy, and our independent foreign policy is very clear in relation to what should happen in the Middle East.” Not long after becoming Taoiseach earlier this year, Harris announced in May that Ireland, in concert with Norway and Spain, would be formally recognizing Palestine as a state. Including Ireland, Norway, and Spain, 145 out of the 193 UN member states have now recognized a Palestinian state. The US is not among them. An alternative Biden Harris!

""I’ve no doubt the EU wants to see a ceasefire,"" Harris, who along with other Irish leaders has repeatedly called for a ceasefire, added. ""I can say all of that, though, and also say the next sentence – all of the efforts have been utterly ineffective to date, because we still don’t have a ceasefire. “So all of us – big countries, small countries, Europe, the United States – need to now say ‘what more can we do to bring the world back from the brink?’ “Because this is an extraordinarily dangerous moment. So, of course, we continue to engage with the United States. “Of course, we’re proud of the diplomatic links between the United States and Ireland, but we can also have, and do have, our own independent foreign policy, which we articulate at every possible opportunity.”",0,1
2024/10/4,"On This Day: Former Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave dies in 2017 Former Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave, who was born a subject of the British Empire as the IRA waged a war for independence, died on this day in 2017. Liam Cosgrave, Ireland’s oldest former Taoiseach (Prime Minister), passed away on October 4, 2017, at the ripe old age of 97 years old. Liam Cosgrave was born a subject of the British Empire as the IRA waged a war for independence and the Black and Tans marauded across the island, but died a citizen of a partitioned but independent Republic at peace with herself and her neighbors. No stranger to public service or power, his father William Thomas took up the baton of leadership after the shock assassination of Michael Collins in 1922. For the first ten years of the new Free State’s existence, he chartered a difficult course in a divided country that was still suffering from terrible grief after the deaths of thousands during the Great War, the 1916 Rebellion, the War of Independence, and then the Civil War. William Thomas Cosgrave (Getty Images) At the precocious age of 23, Liam Cosgrave, a newly accredited trial attorney, was elected a TD (legislator) for the constituency of Dublin County. A few years later he joined the Cabinet as Chief Whip and later was made Minister for External Affair (the Irish equivalent to the position of US Secretary of State). In 1965, he became Fine Gael party leader but the party he had grown up in was changing; the swinging sixties were underway and some of that sense of rebellion had even reached Ireland; many new legislators were more socially liberal than the devoutly Catholic Cosgrove and the press began to wonder how party policy would change. When asked if the party was set to become more left-wing under on his watch he replied cryptically, “A bird never flew on one wing.” Fine Gael lost the 1969 election and the ensuing years of opposition could hardly be described as easy for Cosgrave. As Northern Ireland plunged into the Troubles, Cosgrave uncompromisingly backed the Fianna Fáil Government’s anti-terrorism legislation. Those in his party concerned with the loss of civil liberties were faced down and the 1973 election saw his strategy vindicated as the country elected him as Taoiseach. The Troubles dominated his time in office; the collapse of the Sunningdale Agreement (a precursor to the Good Friday Agreement), the killing of the British Ambassador to Ireland, and the bombing of Dublin and Monaghan by loyalists all took place on his patrician watch.

Daly's book 'Sixties Ireland, Reshaping the Economy, State and Society 1957-1973 today at the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin. (RollingNews.ie) Controversially, his friend, Minister for Defense Paddy Donegan, called the President of Ireland Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh a “thundering disgrace.” The position is mostly ceremonial but the officeholder may at his discretion refer a bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. Ó Dálaigh had recently done just that and after Cosgrave refused to accept Donegan’s resignation, the President acrimoniously resigned. 1977 was a disaster for his party; a redrawing of the constituency boundaries by Minister James Tully, dubbed the “Tullymander,” was supposed to lead to a historic second term for Fine Gael. Instead, the new boundaries actually benefited the opposition Fianna Fáil and the party won an overall majority - something never achieved in Ireland since. He retired from public life in 1981, to be replaced as a TD by his son, Liam. Cosgrave, Sr was last seen publicly at the centenary of the Easter Rising. His wife, Vera, died a few months later. The pair is survived by two sons. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha. * Originally published in October 2017. Updated in October 2022.",0,1

2024/10/6,"Gardaí raise threat level for ministers from ‘moderate’ to ‘substantial’ Extra measures are being taken to protect Government leaders after Garda personal protection officers identified an enhanced threat ahead of the general election campaign. The security threat level to Taoiseach Simon Harris and Cabinet members has escalated from ‘moderate’ to ‘substantial’ in advance of the general election campaign, the Irish Mail on Sunday can reveal. Mr Harris – whose young family were recently subjected to a bomb threat on their home – will be provided with beefed-up security after a recent Garda risk assessment found Coalition leaders are more exposed to potential attacks than ever before. The revelation comes as gardaí this weekend confirmed the force has designated ‘liaison inspectors in every Garda division across the country’ to ensure ‘the safety and security’ of all public representatives and general election candidates. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The MoS has learned that Garda personal protection officers carried out an assessment of ministers’ security in advance of the looming election. It recommended raising the threat level from ‘moderate’ to ‘substantial’, the highest danger rating. Cabinet members’ security has been steadily ramped up in recent years with the restoration of armed, specially trained Garda drivers to all senior ministers, and the provision of high-spec luxury cars. However, senior security sources this weekend said that extra measures would be put in place to protect Government leaders in light of the enhanced threat identified by Garda experts. The Taoiseach and Cabinet ministers will have a greater number of armed gardaí assigned to their protection units. A security source involved in providing VIP protection told the MoS: ‘With politicians moving around more as canvassing for a looming general election increases, we feel that they are more exposed.’ ‘There is going to be nobody more exposed than the Taoiseach, for he will do the most campaigning. Party leaders and certain Cabinet ministers too [will] have had their threat level increased.’ Gardaí have investigated separate incidents of alleged harassment outside the Taoiseach’s Co. Wicklow home, as well as a bomb threat against the property. During the summer, the MoS reported how Government security advisers have urged Mr Harris to move to the Steward’s Lodge in Farmleigh for his protection. Speaking on former Late Late Show presenter Ryan Tubridy’s podcast this week, Mr Harris said he does not intend to move into Farmleigh as it would be ‘very disruptive’ for his children. However, one senior civil servant said there is ‘unanimity’ among gardaí and Government officials that it is no longer ‘sustainable’ for the person holding the office of Taoiseach not to reside at the Steward’s Lodge, where greater protection can be provided. A security source told the MoS: ‘It is no longer possible, practical or feasible for An Taoiseach not to live permanently at the Steward’s Lodge. We can’t just keep continually ramping up the numbers of personnel, firearms and vehicles around the Taoiseach. It is too difficult to protect a VIP of such standing in suburbia.’ A senior Government source added: ‘Whoever ends up as Taoiseach, you know, in five years’ time, it’s very hard to say… but they will have to live at the Steward’s Lodge.’ The source said it ‘is no longer practical’ for the leader of the country to live in a private residence given the heightened security risk. Steward’s Lodge, a four-bedroom house on the grounds of Farmleigh House in Dublin’s Phoenix Park, was refurbished in 2006 for use as a Taoiseach’s residence. While it was envisaged that the property would become an official residence for the Taoiseach of the day, it has been used rarely over the past 18 years. However, greater threats posed to politicians by far-right and other extremists have forced a rethink. A source said the location of Steward’s Lodge is far more manageable for specialist security units to protect. ‘You can concentrate your forces on that property in Phoenix Park, it’s been refurbished specifically with the security of An Taoiseach in mind,’ they added. ‘Never mind the practicality, but the cost of constantly increasing security on various politicians’ houses is not sustainable. The rota on the Taoiseach and other Cabinet ministers is now being filled with more Garda personnel. The cost of placing one armed garda on a security rota is high. And, of course, that garda is then removed from other duties.’ The latest security assessment on Cabinet members was carried out by senior officers in the Crime and Security Branch (CSB), the unit responsible for national security, counter-terrorism and serious crime investigations within the force. The CSB is based at Garda Headquarters, a short distance across Phoenix Park from the Steward’s Lodge. Sources said increased electioneering ahead of the general election – which will have to take place by March at the latest – and the increased instances of bomb threats and other threatening behaviour towards senior politicians were taken into consideration. Increased attacks on politicians in other jurisdictions – there have been two assassination attempts on former US president Donald Trump in recent months – and heightened geopolitical tensions including the widening Middle-East conflict – were also considered by security experts. A source told the MoS: ‘A senior officer at Crime and Security directed gardaí to carry out a full intelligence-led assessment that involved a widescale sweep of online forums and all online communications. Intelligence gleaned from the surveillance of certain groups and individuals was also collated. Also communications or attempted communications with politicians, online and otherwise were assessed.’ Irish Garda Commissioner Drew Harris. Credit: RollingNews.ie The completed report was passed from the head of the CSB to Garda Commissioner Drew Harris, who advises the Government on security matters. The source added: ‘That communication said that the security status had moved from moderate to substantial in recent weeks.’ Last month, the MoS reported how political parties are braced for increased intimidation and violence from far-right mobs in advance of the election. Representatives of parties across the political divide expressed concern about threats to political figures, election candidates and even everyday staff spilling over from social media attacks into real-world confrontations. Speaking about the increased threat, a Fine Gael spokesperson last night said: ‘While election candidates have always faced strong opposition and robust debate in the lead-up to elections, the current climate is different. Some incidents we have witnessed are highly personalised, disproportionally targeting individuals based on their gender, race, or ethnicity. Or those who have worked hard in their communities to support refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants.’ A Fianna Fáil spokesperson said the party offers ‘ongoing workshops, training sessions, and support that cover all aspects of election campaigning. This includes resilience training, canvassing guidance, and strategies for handling negative interactions both in-person and online’. The Green Party has also warned its candidates of the need for increased vigilance: ‘Green Party reps have been made aware of the need for increased vigilance canvassing and campaigning both in person and online to ensure personal safety, and we continue to explore and implement supports for managing such offensive and threatening behaviours.’ Sinn Féin did not respond to MoS queries about its policies and procedures for keeping its candidates safe. However, other opposition parties confirmed they have taken steps to protect their candidates on the campaign trail. A Social Democrats spokesperson said: ‘The safety of our candidates and volunteers is something we take very seriously. The party provides mentoring, training, support and advice for all candidates during election campaigns.’ Gardaí this weekend confirmed that ‘liaison inspectors’ have been appointed in every Garda division ‘to ensure the safety of all individuals involved in election campaigns’. A Garda spokesperson also said that ‘Garda Divisional Crime Prevention Officers are available nationwide to offer support on personal safety concerns’. They said that security matters – including ‘the safety and welfare of public representatives, members of the Oireachtas, and those contesting local, national, or European elections’ – remain under ‘ongoing review’. The spokesperson added: ‘The Garda National Community Engagement Bureau has provided input into a new safety guide for election candidates which provides important guidance and advice on how best they can protect themselves and their election teams while out canvassing and engaging within the community.’ * This article was originally published on Extra.ie.",0,1

Guterres said that the UN’s Force Commander and colleagues are constantly evaluating the situation on the ground and that any necessary steps to ensure the safety of UN personnel would be taken. This would be done in very close cooperation with Ireland. The Taoiseach reiterated it is unacceptable that UN resolutions and the Blue Line in Southern Lebanon have been breached and violated with IDF military activity. The Secretary-General said he shared the concern and engagement between the UN and Israel is ongoing. He and the Taoiseach agreed to stay in close contact. Meanwhile, Ireland's Tánaiste and Minister for Defence Micheál Martin told RTÉ News on Monday evening that ""protection is our number one priority, and to protect our soldiers. ""It seems Israel has set up a forward operating base adjacent to 6-52. “Israel is saying it takes seriously its obligations to keep Irish peacekeepers safe and out of harm's way, but we believe this act by Israel endangers and compromises the safety and security of Irish troops."" The Tánaiste noted how the UN has formally and publically criticized this decision by the IDF. Highlighting what he called “reckless behavior,” the Tánaiste said: “Today we know they detonated - for example - under a controlled explosion a building nearby which had the impact then of damaging the protective barrier of our outer protection barrier.” He added: “Our soldiers are well. They have to take shelter. There is no immediate activity in and around in terms of Hezbollah versus IDF at 6-52."" He went on to say: ""The UN is committed to upholding its mandate, it's not going to accede to the Israeli request to pull back."" Earlier in his interview, the Tánaiste remarked: “The obvious takeaway must be now, we need an end to the war. ""We need an end to death and destruction because it only breeds further hate, it only breeds further violence and war.

2024/10/7,"Irish and Americans petition Irish government for action on driver's license exchanges Prominent Irish and Americans are calling for the establishment of driver’s license reciprocity agreements between Ireland and several US states. A committee comprising representatives from both Ireland and the US has written to Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin regarding the need for the establishment of driver’s license reciprocity agreements between Ireland and some US states. As it stands in Ireland, a driver can exchange their driving license issued by certain 'recognized states' for an Irish driving license. The US is not among the recognized states. Ireland also requires proof of normal Irish residency - at least 185 days per year - to renew Irish driver's licenses. With Irish driver's licenses carrying a maximum ten-year term, many Irish emigrants are eventually prevented from renewing their licenses after moving abroad. As such, Americans moving to Ireland and Irish emigrants returning to Ireland must go through the full Irish driver licensing procedure to get an Irish driver's license - even if they have a US driver's license and or despite having been previously licensed in Ireland. In these instances, however, only six essential driver training (EDT) lessons are required instead of the usual 12 lessons. (This procedure does not apply to US tourists - US citizens are permitted to drive in Ireland for the duration of a visit up to 12 months, but after that period would have to apply for an Irish license.) Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Now, a committee of prominent Irish and Americans is calling for the establishment of driver’s license reciprocity agreements between Ireland and the US states of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Delaware, New York, and Illinois. Among others, the committee includes Irish Presidential Distinguished Service Award for Irish Abroad winner Ciaran Staunton, former President of the GAA Larry McCarthy, founder of IrishCentral Niall O'Dowd, and President of the Ancient Order of Hiberninans Sean Pender. “This proposal seeks to build on the existing framework of Ireland’s reciprocity agreements with other countries, including certain provinces in Canada,"" the committee says in its letter to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste. ""Currently, the US has multiple states with established driver’s license exchange agreements with countries like Canada, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. ""For example, Massachusetts maintains agreements with Korea, Germany, France, and Taiwan, while Pennsylvania has agreements with Germany and France. ""We believe that a similar agreement between Ireland and the aforementioned US states would be mutually beneficial for both Ireland and the United States."" The group asserts that such an arrangement would facilitate seamless transitions for returning citizens, boost business and investment opportunities, and address labor shortages in key industries, particularly construction and commercial driving. ""We believe that with the support and cooperation of the Road Safety Authority and the Department of Foreign Affairs, we can develop a comprehensive reciprocity agreement that benefits both our nations,"" the letter states. The issue of Irish-American driver’s license reciprocity is not a new one. The committee noted in a statement how the matter was considered in the 2018 ""Indecon Economic Report on Addressing Challenges Faced by Returning Irish Emigrants,"" which was presented to Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs. ""In terms of Irish emigrants, the most important country outside of the EU is the United States and the absence of a bilateral agreement with the US is a major issue,"" the 2018 report said regarding driver's license exchanges. The report went on to recommend waiving EDT courses for drivers with previous Irish driving experience and with current overseas licenses; expanding bilateral driver license exchange programme; and improving procedures to facilitate the of driving licenses for Irish emigrants temporarily abroad. Earlier, then-Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told IrishCentral in 2017 that the issue had ""come to his attention in various ways."" However, he stated at the time that because of the huge disparity in driving tests in the US - licenses are issued on a state-by-state basis in the US - he didn't want somebody driving in Ireland who has passed a driving test “nowhere near the standard of the Irish driving test.""",0,1

2024/10/9,"WATCH: Mark Ruffalo accuses Ireland's Green Party of backtracking on LNG promises Mark Ruffalo has accused Ireland's Green Party of going back on its promise to voters to stop the import of fracked gas and LNG, something the party denies. Hollywood actor Mark Ruffalo has enlisted rising Irish actress Alison Oliver to publicize an online petition calling upon Ireland's Green Party to object to legislation that he says would ""fast-track"" the building of LNG terminals in Ireland. In the video posted on Ruffalo's social media channels on October 8, the ""Hulk"" actor told Oliver: “I need your help. ""You know, the Irish Green party’s about to do something really terrible to the environment and our climate.” He continued: ""They’re trying to jam through a bill to fast-track building liquid natural gas terminals that would import fracked gas from the United States and I need you to help me tell the Irish people all about it. “What’s worse is that the Green Party, which promised the voters that they would stop their import of fracked gas and LNG [liquefied natural gas] when they joined the coalition government in 2020, but since then they have been opening for the Irish government to build an LNG terminal in the Shannon Estuary of all places.” Oliver replied: “Oh, wow. Green Party breaking their environmental promises. Can’t make this stuff up.” Ruffalo went on: “We can demand that the Greens get off gas and stop LNG, that’s the best thing we can do. “They need to remove the LNG fast tracking and prioritization as a strategic infrastructure from the planning bill and permanently just ban LNG now. “And everyone - Irish, or Irish heart - needs to go out and sign this petition at GreensOffGas.org. That’s what we need to do.” At the time of publication on Wednesday afternoon, the online petition had garnered more than 6,100 signatures. Irish friends, watch this video Alison Oliver and I made about how the @greenparty_ie is about to break its promise and pass a bill to fast-track & prioritise dangerous LNG terminals.

Ruffalo, who has previously waded in on Irish environmental matters, posted his video with Oliver the day before the massive Planning and Development Bill 2023 was set to be debated and voted upon in the Dáil. According to The Irish Times, the Bill allows, in part, for planning applications to be made for LNG terminals in Ireland. The Bill has the support of Ireland's Green Party, which says it is still anti-LNG. The Irish Examiner reports that a spokesperson for Ireland's Green Party said Ruffalo offered a “very misleading account” of what the amendment to the Planning Bill does. However, Ruffalo doubled down on Wednesday, writing on X: ""What’s misleading is that the planning bill doesn’t say anything about stopping commercial LNG. ""Consequently, it leaves it open to everything including Shannon LNG. ""Read the text of your own amendments. The public should understand what this bill means for them as well. You made a promise to them."" Ruffalo limited the replies to his posts that he shared with his more than 8 million followers. Good day @greenparty_ie what’s misleading is that the planning bill doesn’t say anything about stopping commercial LNG. Consequently, it leaves it open to everything including Shannon LNG. Read the text of your own amendments. The public should understand what this bill means for… Responding to Ruffalo's initial claims on Wednesday, Eamon Ryan, Ireland's Minister for the Environment and former head of the Green Party, told RTÉ Radio that the legislation ""doesn't signal any intent to change government policy or to fast track any gas infrastructure, it's purely technical nature."" Ryan said that critics who claim the legislation would accelerate Ireland's contribution to climate change are wrong. ""I think they're reading something into an amendment that doesn't actually exist in reality. It is there for technical reasons, not for any change in policy."" There are, however, objections to the legislation in the Dáil. As RTÉ noted earlier on Wednesday, there are 177 pages of amendments from the Seanad, but the discussion is limited to three hours, and there will be a final vote tonight. TD Ivana Bacik, the head of Ireland's Labour Party, said in the Dáil on Wednesday: ""I want to raise just one issue - something Hollywood's Mark Ruffalo has been campaigning on for years. ""His issue with what I might call this hulking piece of legislation is the group of new amendments on the importation of liquified natural gas, LNG. ""This is a domestic issue for us but it is of concern internationally and to Mr. Ruffalo because he is from Pennsylvania in the US, where fracking-sourced LNG terminals have been linked to asthma, rare childhood cancers and adverse birth outcomes. ""Here at home, the Government is trying to designate floating terminals as strategic infrastructure so that LNG can be imported into Ireland, circumventing normal planning processes."" She continued: ""The Government has insisted that existing policy amounts to an LNG moratorium. That argument has never held water, especially not since last week's High Court decision that there is no way of enforcing the moratorium so there is no ban. ""The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has said he does not think commercial LNG terminals will be installed in Ireland. Respectfully, we do not legislate based on a vibe or a ministerial whim. I am quite frankly shocked at this approach by the Minister with responsibility for climate action. ""Green Party TDs are sitting across on Government benches now. I am the first person on this side of the House to acknowledge the progress on climate action that has been made due to their presence in government. As a lifelong environmentalist, I welcome that, but that is why I am so concerned to see that they might at the eleventh hour be on the verge of undoing that work. ""This is not just a problem for the Green Party; it is a problem for all of us."" 😮 Government must support Labour amendments tonight instead of their disastrous plan to allow LNG terminals to be exempted from the planning process.

2024/11/1,"On This Day: Kevin Barry was executed in Dublin in 1920 Kevin Barry's execution on November 1, 1920, is considered to be the ""final straw"" for Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins. Kevin Barry was 18 years old when he was executed on November 1, 1920, over the murder of a British soldier. Dermot McEvoy believes this was what tipped Michael Collins over the edge. Barry was hanged in Mountjoy Prison. He had been apprehended during an IRA raid gone wrong in North King Street in Dublin several weeks before. Barry was sentenced to death because a young British soldier was killed in the ambush. Michael Collins tried to break him out of Mountjoy Prison but was unsuccessful. As someone who has studied the Big Fellow for over 50 years, I believe this was the final straw for Michael Collins. Since September 1919 when he had assembled his infamous assassination Squad—AKA, “The Twelve Apostles”—Collins and his intelligence network had been inching towards a full-blown confrontation with the British Secret Service. The pressure on Collins had been mounting for several weeks before Barry’s death. On October 14, the British Secret Service had found the desperately wanted Tipperary rebel Seán Treacy at the Republican Outfitters shop at 94 Talbot Street (the building is still there, marked by a plaque). As Treacy came out a gunfight ensued—caught by a passing photographer—and Treacy was shot and killed. On October 25, Terence MacSwiney, the Republican Lord May of Cork City, starved himself to death at Brixton Prison in England. His body was returned to Cork on Halloween, the day before Kevin Barry’s hanging. The British came out in force—DMP, RIC, MI-5—looking for Michael Collins because they knew Collins frequently attended funerals despite the danger of being recognized. But Collins was not there; he was in Dublin, plotting. As the rope tightened around Collins and his intelligence Squad, Collins—with supreme patience—waited. Collins was, like many great men and women, likely bi-polar. His depression over the loss of his friends quickly turned to mania and the Squad went to work. On Sunday, November 21, three weeks after the death of Kevin Barry —now known as “Bloody Sunday” in the annals of Irish history—Collins sent out his Squad resulting in the deaths of 14 agents of the British Secret Service. For the first time in Irish history, the Irish had actually terrorized the British. It has been recorded that the lines of terrified British agents and their relatives clogged up the gateways trying to get into Dublin Castle. For all real purposes, the war was over. It would take the British eight more months to figure out how to free themselves from their Irish quagmire, but by July 1921 a truce was called. By the autumn the negotiations had begun—again with Michael Collins as the lead player—and the rest is history. There is one interesting footnote to this story. Barry was buried in the yard at Mountjoy Prison like a common criminal. After Bloody Sunday, nine other young rebels were also hanged and buried next to Barry in the yard at Mountjoy. Today, they are known as “The Forgotten Ten”: Barry, plus Thomas Whelan, Patrick Moran, Patrick Doyle, Bernard Ryan, Thomas Bryan, Frank Flood, Thomas Traynor, Patrick Maher, and Edmund Foley. [For more information on this mostly forgotten period of Irish history from early in 1921, see Tim Carey’s “Hanged for Ireland: A Documentary History”. Blackwater Press, 2001.] Finally, on October 14, 2001—nearly 81 years after his heroic death for his country—Barry’s remains and those of the other young rebels [except for Patrick Maher who was buried in Ballylanders, County Limerick at his family’s request] were reinterred at Glasnevin Cemetery next to the remains of Roger Casement and in front of the appropriately named Republican Plot where many famous Irish revolutionaries are planted. The then-Taoiseach [Irish Prime Minister] Bertie Ahern, said at that time: “These 10 young men were executed during the War of Independence. The country was under tremendous pressure at the time. There was a united effort. Meanwhile, elected by the people, Dáil Éireann [Irish Parliament] was developing, in spite of a war going on. Democracy was being put to work. Independent civic institutions, including the Dáil courts, were beginning to function. Before their deaths, the ten had seen the light of freedom. They understood that Ireland would be free and independent.” *Dermot McEvoy is the author of “The 13th Apostle: A Novel of a Dublin Family,"" and ""Michael Collins, and the Irish Uprising” (Skyhorse Publishing). *Originally published in October 2015, updated in 2024.",0,1

The actor ran his hometown marathon in support of his pal Emma Fogarty who, at 40, is the longest-surviving Irish woman with the agonizing skin condition. The two teamed up for the ""Run to 40"" campaign, which has raised more than €845k as of Friday afternoon. Farrell wheeled Fogarty for the final 4km of the Dublin Marathon on Sunday. Afterward, Farrell said: “I have known Emma for many years and she epitomises bravery, she is what courage and pure determination are all about. “That run was nothing compared to the pain she is forced to endure every single day, even though she doesn’t show it. “It was an honour to see her waiting for me with 4km to go, each of those representing a decade of her life, and to do the final stretch together.

The Irish charity organization says that for the third year in a row, the Government has failed to prioritize funding for EB care in Budget 2025. ""This year, we asked the Government to ring-fence €600,000 for EB home nursing care and invest a further €95,000 to ensure holistic integrated care in line with the vision of Sláintecare (2021),"" Debra said.

Funding towards essential supports could have alleviated some of the heavy burden of this lifelong incurable disease. The emotional and physical toll on people with EB and their families is significant, and being overlooked by Budget 2025 is yet another blow to them.""",0,1
2024/11/11,"This is why the Irish no longer mark Remembrance Day The first Veterans Day, usually called Armistice or Remembrance Day in Ireland, was marked in 1919 a year to the day after the guns fell silent across the Western Front. Veterans Day or Remembrance Day used to bring Ireland to a standstill but whilst it still pulls a crowd in Northern Ireland, down south it is now largely forgotten and ignored, marked only by a small minority. This year, 2023, marks the 105rth anniversary of Armistice Day, the day on which the armistice was signed between the Allies of World War I and Germany at Compiègne, France, for the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of the First World War. The first Veterans Day, usually called Armistice or Remembrance Day in Ireland, was marked in 1919 a year to the day after the guns fell silent across the Western Front. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Some 210,000 people living in Ireland signed up to fight in the Great War of whom at least 35,000 died. The overall figure for the number of Irish dead, however, is thought to be closer to 50,000 as an unknowable number of Irish people living in the United States, Britain, and the Empire signed up to serve in the militaries of those countries too. Recruitment had been particularly strong amongst Ireland’s Protestant community, many of whom were keen to prove their loyalty and worth to Britain as the debate over Home Rule raged in London. Equally, however, a large number of Catholic nationalists signed up; some were eager to help protect Ireland from invasion, whilst others hoped to help liberate small Catholic Belgium from German tyranny. Others just wanted an adventure. Few, if any, communities in Ireland escaped bereavement during the ensuing four years and the first anniversary of the conflict’s end saw a widespread desire to remember those who had passed in a dignified way. As 11 o’clock approached on November 11 people across the island began to gather in town and city centers. In Dublin, thousands had gathered on College Green and the establishment Irish Times recorded that “a calm and stillness pervaded the entire city”. Cars pulled over, flags flew at half mast, Dublin’s trams abruptly stopped as electricity to the whole city was flicked off and as Trinity College’s great clock struck 11 there was “an immediate hush”. “Nothing was more striking than to see the male portion of the immense gathering doff their hats and bow their heads during the two minutes of solemn silence.” Love Irish history? Share your favorite stories with other history buffs in the IrishCentral History Facebook group. A spontaneous rendition of God Save The King then rang out across Dublin with what was described as “much fervor”. Nearly a year into the War of Independence was this the last gasp of the British Empire in Ireland? A defiant expression of belief in the Act of Union or just an unrepresentative gathering of Dublin unionists? Whereas the commemorations of 1919 had passed without incident, tensions had risen by 1920 as the War of Independence had escalated: a parade of shipyard workers had stones thrown at them on Belfast’s Henry Street with two young girls hospitalized as a result. In Galway threatening notes appeared on shop doors demanded they shut “in memory of the gallant lads”. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Observance however varied across the island: government institutions and unionist communities treated the day with reverence but in nationalist circles recognition of the day was patchy: in Carrick-on-Shannon, in Co Leitrim, the bells of both Catholic and Protestant Churches pealed out in remembrance, whilst in Athlone, Co Roscommon all shops in the town center shuttered for the day. In Cork meanwhile, most of the public ignored the anniversary, although it was noted a Sinn Féin prisoner detained for court-martial happily leaped to his feet for the two minutes silence at Victoria Barracks. As the twenties went on the format of the day changed little: even though most of the island was no longer part of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack and the other markers of British identity were still to be found at many Armistice Day ceremonies as if partition had never taken place. Poppies too were a now common presence on the lapels of men and women in November: the red flower was the first things to grow from the churned up mud of the battlefield and soon became an iconic symbol of remembrance across the British Empire. The Legion of Irish Ex-Servicemen sold only 5,000 of the plastic flowers in 1922 but within a few years, the number had mushroomed to 500,000. Parades of veterans were now an annual fixture; in Cork, thousands attended each year and in Dublin, it was ten of thousands with huge numbers of young boys in the crowds wearing the medals of fallen fathers and brothers. But as the years slipped by republicans increasingly found the day hard to bear: in 1926 the Anti-Imperialist newspaper was founded and its first edition dealt with the issue of Armistice Day head-on. “When it was first announced that November 11th was set apart as the day on which those who had lost their relatives in the Great War should honor their memory, many generous Irish people… held that bereaved relatives of British soldiers should be allowed to hold their commemoration services without interference,” the paper wrote. But the reality of the day was not the mere remembrance of the dead, the paper argued, “the purpose of Armistice Day celebrations in Ireland was to hold a pro-British rally in every town in Ireland.” The singing of God Save The King and the waving of Union Jacks at such ceremonies was it concluded, “the expression of the passions of the mob.” Certainly many within southern Ireland’s unionist minority saw the anniversary as the one day when they could publicly fly the flag they were born under and sing the anthem of Empire without apology. With Ireland still divided over the symbols of Irishness and Britishness in society, “poppy snatching” became a common sport in November and female poppy sellers took to hiding razor blades inside the paper flowers as a deterrence. Counter-demonstrations by anti-imperialists were common; in Dublin, poppy wearers were sometimes attacked by men wearing Easter Lilies - in memory of the republican dead of 1916 - prompting the safety conscious to stop buying the flowers and stay away from ceremonies; heckles of “Up the Republic” wafted over the streets of Dublin and any singing of God Save The King was countered with the Free State anthem, The Soldiers’ Song. It was a day many in the state’s new police force, An Garda Síochána, came to dread and Garda Commissioner Eoin O’Duffy wrote a bitter letter in 1932 to the Minister of Justice complaining about the manpower and effort required to keep participants from coming to blows. In 1934 a new commemorative event was added to the Armistice Day roster: Patrick Byrne, a republican, set up an alternative, anti-war, republican Armistice Day service that would remember those who fought and died without the frills of the Empire. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! “I urged the new approach,” he wrote, “because of the disgust, I felt when I saw some ex-servicemen being set upon for wearing their medals and poppies on their ragged coats. “I ask you to give the benefit of the doubt,” he urged his republican friends, “to those who wear poppies tomorrow. Many will wear them in memory of friends who were deluded into dying for fine ideals in a horrible capitalist war. Respect them for the love of their dead people.” An Armistice Day stripped of overtly British symbols was the only acceptable way to mark the day for republicans and a new, more staunchly green Government, led by Éamon de Valera, banned the wearing of British uniforms in parades, the display of Union Jacks and the sing of the God Save The King - although the latter provision was summarily ignored. In 1939 Dev, however, made it known he would attend the opening of the much delayed Irish National War Memorial Gardens in Dublin. His attendance, his office made clear, was conditional on, “the absence of anything which might tend to create ill-feeling or resentment or to embarrass the Government in the slightest degree”. Namely no British songs, no three cheers for the King and there shouldn’t be a Union Jack in sight. Ultimately Dev sat out the ceremony - citing the looming threat of the conscription in Northern Ireland should a Second World War break out - but he certainly wasn’t alone in that; observance of Remembrance Day in southern Ireland was increasingly on the decline. Once the main national commemoration had been moved outside of Dublin city center to Phoenix Park it almost gave people permission to forget about the event: it was out of sight and therefore mostly out of mind. The death of over three and a half thousand men from southern Ireland during the Second World War did little to revive interest in the day. The Protestant population of the Irish Republic was in steep decline, the immediate relatives of the dead were dying off and those who returned from fighting Hitler in 1945 encountered such stigma that they hid their medals. By the 1940’s even the former champion of the British connection, The Irish Times, had stopped reporting the event. The event has rarely pricked the consciousness of the average citizen since with one grim exception: in 1987 an IRA bomb exploded at a packed Remembrance Sunday service in Enniskillen, the county town of Fermanagh. Attendance at Remembrance Day services remains strong in the north where poppies are still common and memories of the dead are still greatly treasured and grieved over by the unionist community. A large crowd had gathered close to the town’s war memorial as 11 o’clock drew near. The chatter of the mourners, however, was suddenly obscured by a loud explosion, followed by screams and the crash of bricks as the wall of a nearby building collapsed. The bomb had been meant for the soldiers waiting to parade by the war memorial but the explosion happened much closer to the crowd and ended up killing 12 civilians and injuring a further 63. It was one of the worst atrocities of the Troubles and sent shockwaves around the world. Loyalists paramilitaries in Belfast swiftly retaliated the next day by shooting a Catholic and a Protestant they mistook for a Catholic. Margaret Thatcher, already clad in mourning black for the dead of two World Wars, described the incident as, “a blot on mankind”.

The controversy even rippled across the Atlantic after Bono launched a much-publicized attack on the “armchair” republicanism of Irish America. “I’ve had enough of Irish Americans who haven’t been back to their country in 20 or 30 years, come up to me and talk about the resistance, the revolution back home. And the glory of the revolution,” he barked at concert goers in Denver, Colorado. “Where’s the glory in bombing a Remembrance Day parade of old-age pensioners, their medals taken out and polished up for the day?” It was, a spokesman for Sinn Féin admitted at the time, “a major setback” for the IRA and 10 years later Gerry Adams apologized for the attack.

Since then the quandary of the poppy and Remembrance Day has only occasionally flared up as an issue in Irish society: in 1991 President Mary Robinson began the tradition of attending the annual Sunday service at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Dublin, each year laying a poppy wreath on behalf of the Irish nation. Conspicuously, she never wore the poppy - although her husband did. Her successor, Mary McAleese, decided ""after long deliberation” not to wear one to her Inauguration on Remembrance Day in 1997 but continued to lay the wreath at the Sunday service. Her successor, the current incumbent Michael D Higgins, has done likewise. Derry-born James McClean who plays soccer for the English team of West Bromwich Albion has received death threats, been booed by his own club’s supporters and had bottles thrown at him for his refusal to wear a shirt with the red flower embroidered into it during matches. “The Poppy is used to remember victims of other conflicts since 1945 and this is where the problem starts for me,” he wrote in a letter released to fans. “For people from the North of Ireland such as myself, and specifically those in Derry, scene of the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre, the poppy has come to mean something very different. “For me to wear a poppy would be as much a gesture of disrespect for the innocent people who lost their lives in the Troubles – and Bloody Sunday especially - as I have in the past been accused of disrespecting the victims of WWI and WWII.” In 2017 Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar reignited the controversy when he wore a shamrock poppy pin in the Dáil, thus becoming the first Irish head of government or state to wear the near century-old symbol. ""The Taoiseach was given the shamrock poppy by Senator Frank Feighan and the issue has also been supported by Senator Neale Richmond,” a spokesman for Varadkar said. ""The Shamrock Poppy recognizes Irish soldiers who fought in World War I. It was commissioned to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Great War by the Irish branch of the Royal British Legion to remember the 206,000 Irishmen that fought"". Reaction ranged from blunt condemnation to praise for his actions. “Delighted to see the Taoiseach commemorate young men like my great uncle Pvt. John McMahon who left the Liberties to fight for others' liberty in Belgium but never came home,” his party colleague Councillor Keith Redmond tweeted. “I see nationalists are trying to force Leo Varadkar not to wear the poppy. Yet when McClean doesn't wear one it's free choice. #Hypocrites,” another Twitter user, William Gillespie, opined. “The new Irish attitude towards the British is nauseating,” blogger Cáit Trainor wrote, “the rehabilitation of Irish men who went to fight and die in an army, for a country that was occupying their native land and murdering its people is nothing short of despicable, they weren’t “our men”, yes they were Irish men, but they were Irish men in the British Army”.

With the centenary of the 1918 Armistice with Germany fast approaching, it’s safe to assume that debate on the appropriate way to honor the Irish dead of the Great War will ramp up. Poppies might become a slightly more common sight on the streets of the Republic, attendance at Remembrance Day services will probably pick up a bit, children will be told about their nan’s great uncle who fell on the Somme. But it’ll be nothing like the 1920s: for millions, it will just be another November day, there won’t be Union Jacks outside of the north and no priest will offer three cheers or prayers for the Queen. It’ll be a day of reflection in newspapers and for some ordinary citizens but it’ll no longer bring Ireland to a standstill. The days of allegiance to the British Crown in the Irish Republic have slipped into the history books, as have memories of the fallen. For republicans the day was divisive and unpleasant; they hated its associations and their protests put off many who would otherwise have wished to have marked the anniversary. And so that is why the Irish no longer mark Veterans Day. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! * Originally published in 2017, updated in Nov 2024.",0,1

2024/11/14,"Billy Lawless, a lonely voice for Irish voting rights Billy Lawless, with full voice, called for voting rights for all Irish citizens. Last week, Billy Lawless passed away. He was a loyal son of his native Galway, a great Chicago entrepreneur, and a tireless advocate for immigrants. He will be greatly missed. Billy was a man full of energy with a big heart who was the first (and so far only) Senator for the Diaspora in the Irish Seanad, appointed by then-Taoiseach Enda Kenny in 2016. I first met Billy in 2016 with my colleague Noreen Bowden, an expert on the Irish diaspora, when we found common cause in securing voting rights for Irish citizens living outside the State - whether in London, New York, or just over the Border in Derry. We tracked Billy down in Washington DC even before his Seanad appointment and over an evening dinner hatched a new organization, VotingRights.ie. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Ireland, oddly, has no absentee ballot process for citizens temporarily living overseas except for members of the military and diplomats, and unlike most members of the European Union, wants to keep it that way. Ireland has a rule that requires citizens to intend to return to Ireland within 18 months or have their name struck from the voting register. This ban on emigrants voting is outdated, yet it stays on the books making Irish emigrants second-class citizens the minute they leave the Dublin Airport. And Irish citizens and passport holders living just over the Border in Derry or Belfast are not allowed to vote either. As a result, when Mary McAleese ran for the Irish Presidency in 1997, her husband Martin could not vote for her because they lived in Belfast. The 2021 IDEA global democracy report noted a total of 125 states and territories allow people living abroad to participate in legislative elections, 88 allow participation in presidential elections, and 73 countries and territories allow citizens overseas to participate in referendums. Ireland is not one of them. Of the 14 EU Member States that hold direct Presidential elections, only Ireland, Slovakia, and Cyprus deprive their overseas citizens of the vote. Ireland is the only EU Member State that does not allow its nationals living in another EU Member State to vote in European elections. This restriction violates the EU’s freedom-of-movement principle in depriving citizens the vote in their home country. Billy, to his credit, with full voice called for voting rights for all Irish citizens. The 2013 Constitutional Convention had proposed that all Irish citizens including emigrants be allowed to vote in future Presidential elections. The new Foreign Minister Simon Coveney was an enthusiastic supporter since this reform was part of the new government program of government. In 2017, the delegates to the Global Civic Forum were unanimous in their support and Ciaran Cannon T.D. was appointed the Minister for the Diaspora. Cannon took to his new position with great energy and met with countless groups across the diaspora. And in 2021 we issued a set of papers entitled CitizenshipPapers.ie. We soon realized, however, that securing this reform would be an uphill fight. We met with the new Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin, a long-time friend but a cautious man, and over the years, held several Zoom conversations with the Minister for Electoral Reform Malcolm Noonan T.D. In 2020, the government turned its back on voting rights and failed to reappoint Billy as the Senator for the Diaspora. After Billy’s stellar performance in giving a voice to the Irish abroad, we were more than disappointed. Today, Irish emigrants have no representation in the Seanad - and there is no Northern voice. Partition has its uses. In 2021, Billy received his consolation prize becoming a recipient of the Presidential Distinguished Service Award. So what to make of this experience? I have come to the conclusion that Ireland is a parochial and complacent democracy, turning its back on voting rights for citizens living outside the state including Northern Ireland. The Leinster House establishment is just fine with the status quo even as democracy declines around the world. None of the major political parties standing for the upcoming election make mention of voting rights for all citizens in their manifestos. Indeed many long overdue democratic reform proposals from Seanad reform to voting rights are always kicked to touch. Ireland is an emigrant nation - and for over a decade about 30,000 young people have left Ireland every year. These are the same young people who twice came #HometoVote to make Ireland a more progressive nation. Many will return home, but the State does not make it easy even now. If Ireland wants to be at the very heart of the EU experience in the years to come, it should abide by international and EU democratic norms and become a more inclusive democracy. Ireland should not assume that it gets a free pass from the heady promises of populist authoritarian strongmen. In recent elections in both Poland and Moldova, the vote of the diaspora was critical to the election of Pro-Western leaders. Allowing a voice in the political process for all citizens, regardless of their residence, would safeguard Irish democracy and be a tangible step toward Irish unity. Tabhair dúinn an vóta.

2024/11/25,"Irish General Election 2024: Where do the parties stand on pension reform? IrishCentral contributor, Michael Malone examines Ireland's pensions on the ballot with less than a week to Ireland's elections. With less than one week to go before the general election, the cost of living, the housing crisis, and the healthcare system have been among the most prominent issues on the doorsteps across Ireland. An issue that has taken somewhat of a backseat so far in the campaign is that of pensions and retirement age. This year, the coalition Government introduced ""auto-enrolment"" from next September, which will help almost 800,000 workers save for retirement. The current State Pension in Ireland is €289.30 per week and the retirement age is 66, with 65-year-olds entitled to a Benefit Payment until they retire at 66. However, many workers are still contractually obliged to retire at 65. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! So what have Ireland's political parties said so far on the issue as we enter the final stretch? The National Pension Helpline has examined the general election manifestos of the main political parties ahead of Friday's vote, to see where each party stands on pensions. Fine Gael's manifesto states that the party would keep the pension age at 66, but it wants to increase the State Pension to €350 over the lifetime of the next Dáil [Parliament]. Taoiseach [Irish leader] Simon Harris' party would remove the mandatory retirement age of 65 in employment contracts for those who want to continue working. Fine Gael would extend the Household Benefits Package, lowering the eligibility age for this package to include all pensioners aged 66 and over. They also want to raise the Living Alone allowance to €33 and appoint a Commissioner for Positive Ageing. Another pledge included in the manifesto details plans to appoint a standalone Minister of State for Older People ensuring that the voices of older people are heard. Fianna Fáil wants to keep the pension age at 66 and increase the State Pension to at least €350 per week over the next Dáil term. Like its coalition partners, the Fianna Fáil would legally enable people to work beyond 65. The party has committed to increasing the Widow’s, Widower’s or Surviving Civil Partner’s Pension, the Blind Pension and the Invalidity Pension. The party would also recognize foster care through social welfare credits so that foster carers can access the State’s contributory pension. Sinn Féin, currently the largest party in opposition, wants to reduce the retirement age to 65 and increase the state pension rate by €50. The party would also end mandatory retirement at 65 to allow workers to remain at work if they wish to do so. Sinn Féin has committed to a full review of state pensions for foster carers, and to engage with the Irish Foster Care Association in relation to their needs. The party supports auto-enrolment, however, the party raises two objections to the current proposals in its 2024 Election Manifesto. The first is that the party opposes any attempts for contributions to be collected and handed over to the private pension industry. Secondly, Sinn Féin opposes low-paid workers not being allowed to opt out and reclaim part of their wages for six months. The Greens have pledged to advance the planned system of auto-enrolment which will begin in September next year, and ban mandatory retirement in ""most circumstances"". The Green Party plans to provide long-term foster carers with access to pension entitlements to recognize the key role their care plays for vulnerable children. The party has said that it would also accelerate the work of the Commission on Generational Renewal to ""identify options for a retirement scheme for farmers"" within the first six months of the next Dáil term. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The Social Democrats, who have six sitting TDs (Teachta Dála meaning Members of Parliament) in Dáil Éireann, would link the State Pension to at least 34% of the average wage, and ensure the system recognizes the work of foster carers. The party wishes to increase social welfare pensions by €25 per week, and argues for an end to ""auction politics on pensions"". In the party's 2025 Alternative Budget, the SocDems argued for an increase in state social welfare pensions by €25 per week, and reforms to the retirement scheme for farmers. The Labour Party has said that it wants to keep the pension age at 66, and link increases in the state pension to 34% of average earnings. Like most other parties, it would also remove barriers to remaining in the workforce after 65 for those who wish to work beyond that age. The Labour Party has committed to addressing the reported gender pension gap of 36% in Ireland by setting up an expert group to examine the issue. The party would introduce an occupational supplementary pension as a key retention measure for post-2013 personnel in the Defence Forces, An Garda Síochána, the Prison Service and Fire Service, to bridge the gap for those forced to retire early. Labour has committed to supporting foster carers with better pension entitlement. The party would also ensure cohorts of retired semi-state workers from CIE and An Post are not blocked from receiving pension increases, as well as protecting pension rights of people in defined benefit schemes. The party wants to ensure retired workers have access to the industrial relations mechanisms for pension scheme changes and other related issues. People Before Profit (PBP) would immediately increase the state pension to €300 and benchmark pensions to average earnings from 2026. PBP wants to lower the pension age to 65 and extend eligibility for the Fuel Allowance to all pensioners. In 2021, the party introduced a Bill in the Dáil that would give retired workers’ associations more rights to take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) when changes are proposed to existing occupational pension schemes. This would also ensure that retired workers could have greater representation on trustee boards of schemes. Solidarity, which forms an alliance with left-wing People Before Profit, argues for the pension age to be reduced to 60 years in its General Election manifesto. The party wants to see a 'guaranteed decent pension' for all by introducing a unified benefit scheme for all workers. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish!

On the campaign trail ahead of Friday's General Election, Taoiseach Simon Harris discussed the implications of a second Trump presidency on Ireland's economy while on Sky News on Sunday, November 25. The GOP's 2024 ""Make America Great Again"" platform pledges to ""rebalance trade"" in America and ""support baseline tariffs on foreign made goods."" The platform says: ""As tariffs on foreign producers go up, taxes on American workers, families, and businesses can come down."" Economists, however, have warned that imposing tariffs will actually lead to higher costs for consumers. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! During his Sky News interview on Sunday, Harris was asked if he thinks President-elect Donald Trump “means what he says when he talks about imposing tariffs on imports from the EU and attracting big US multinationals back from Ireland?” Harris responded: “I think President Trump does mean what he says in terms of his position in relation to trade and tariffs. And I think President Trump has received a very large mandate in terms of the outcome of the US Presidential election. “And I do, being very honest, think that the second Trump presidency may not be comparable to the first for a variety of reasons, including that increased mandate that he’s now received, including looking at the some of the key appointments that he’s making to his cabinet in terms of the direction of trade. “And that’s why I’m preparing my country and working with EU counterparts to prepare the EU for that changed reality we may see. “Ireland can approach this with confidence. There are many reasons firms locate in Ireland, including our access to the European Union. But also, we can never be complacent. And that’s why my party [Fine Gael] is setting aside a very significant amount into funds, future funds, to protect our country from any economic shock. “I think President-elect Trump is a businessman. He is transactional in many ways. He approaches the world through the lens of a businessman. “We will be making the point that Iirsh companies are now creating jobs in every US state, and that actually trade between the US and Ireland and trade between the US and the EU is good not just for people in the EU and Ireland, but it’s also good for people who voted for President Trump.” In a Q&A with The Irish Times last week, the Taoiseach touched upon Ireland's long-term economy: ""Every single day we’re taking decisions on the long-term future, and we’re actually very proudly setting aside billions each year into a fund called the Future Ireland Fund, so that if any shocks come to our economy ... we’ve set aside money."" The Future Ireland Fund - described by Ireland's Department of Finance as ""a long-term savings fund to deal with recognized expenditure pressures including aging, climate, and the digital transitions"" - was commenced in July. The fund is touted in Fine Gael's party manifesto for this week's General Election: ""Fine Gael established the Future Ireland Fund and the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund to protect public services over the long term and mitigate the pro-cyclicality of capital spending."" For each year from 2024 to 2035, 0.8 percent of GDP will be transferred to the Fund from the Exchequer. Taking account of annual contributions, growth in GDP, and potential return from investments, the Fund has the capacity to grow to €100 billion by 2040. In October, Ireland's Minister for Finance, Jack Chambers TD, announced the completion of the first annual transfer from the Exchequer to the Future Ireland Fund of 0.8% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), equal to a sum of €4.05 billion.",0,1

Roderic O'Gorman, the leader of Ireland's Green Party and Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth of Ireland, is highly critical of US Presidential nominee Donald Trump, particularly for his views on climate change. “During his campaign, Mr. Trump has called climate change a ‘hoax’ and ‘one of the great scams of all time’,” O'Gorman said, according to the Irish Mirror on Monday, the day before the US elections. “He also promised to scrap clean energy projects, incentives for electric cars, and unleash a 'drill, baby, drill' wave of oil and gas projects.

""It is vital that Donald Trump does not win this election. “Tragically, the flooding in Spain has reminded all of us just what climate change means for ordinary people. The next few years will be crucial for the future of the planet.

A Dublin man has pleaded guilty to the assault of Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman. Karl Ronan, of Erris Square, Waterville in Blanchardstown appeared before Judge David McHugh at Blanchardstown District Court on Monday morning. The incident happened on Saturday afternoon (November 2) when Mr. O’Gorman, 42, called to a doorstep in Blanchardstown during a canvass ahead of the general election. The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth was not hurt during the incident. An armed female Garda protection officer, who had been shadowing the politician, intervened.

(RollingNews.ie) Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Mr. Ronan has been charged following the section 2 assault as well as for use or engagement in threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. The Dubliner has also been charged with causing damage to property - a clipboard - belonging to Mr. O’Gorman. Garda Joseph Rogers gave evidence of Ronan’s arrest, charge, and caution. The Garda said Ronan made no reply when the charges were put to him. Defence solicitor Tertius Van Eeden said that his client was pleading guilty to all three charges. Judge McHugh said Mr O’Gorman would have to be contacted and asked if he wanted to address the court or write a letter about the incident, which would be considered by the court. As a result, the case was put back a few weeks to allow for the politician to be contacted. The accused was granted bail on his own bond of €100 and was told not to contact Mr. O’Gorman, either directly or indirectly, or make a comment about the case online. He warned that the bail terms were to be ""interpreted strictly."" An Taoiseach Simon Harris said the incident was ""unacceptable and cannot be tolerated in a modern democracy,"" adding: ""I have spoken to Minister O’Gorman. I am so glad to hear he is OK and back out canvassing."" The Fine Gael leader added that ""it is important to state the overwhelming majority of people are fundamentally decent."" Mr O’Gorman said he was grateful to a Garda protection officer who intervened. The minister, who provided a statement to Gardaí, said the ""alarming incident"" had marred an otherwise positive canvass. Government ministers had armed Garda protection reinstated more than two years ago due to increased fears that members of the Cabinet could be targeted. Protection had been taken away from most ministers in 2011 due to budget cuts but was brought back in October 2022. *This article was originally published on Extra.ie.",0,1

Claire Cronin, the US Ambassador to Ireland, issued a video message on Tuesday from Dublin as millions of Americans headed to the polls for the 2024 US Presidential election. The US Ambassador, who was nominated for her role by President Biden in 2021, was hosting an election night watch party at The Guinness Storehouse in Dublin on Tuesday night. ""I appreciate the great interest that the Irish people have in the US political system and our elections,"" Cronin said in her video message posted on social media on Tuesday afternoon. ""As I have traveled around this beautiful country, I have met many Irish people who are so eager to talk about polls, swing states, and even the electoral college. ""So tonight, as we watch the results come in, I think of what President Biden has said about the importance of democracy: the right to vote, to have your vote counted, is the threshold of democracy and liberty everywhere in the world and with it anything is possible.

The Bill, introduced by Senator Frances Black in 2018, aims to ban trade between Ireland and Israel’s illegal settlements in Occupied Palestinian Territories. It has been stalled at committee stage in the Dáil since 2020. According to The Ditch, Cronin issued her emails on October 22, less than a week after Taoiseach Simon Harris told reporters that Ireland ""will not wait for everybody in Europe to move on the issue of trade in the Occupied Palestinian Territories [OPT]."" The Ditch reports that in her email, Cronin wrote in part: “I encourage your teams to conduct thorough due diligence on the bill's potential impact to avoid any unforeseen consequences that could detract what you hope to achieve with this legislation.""

2024/11/5,"Everything you need to know ahead of Ireland's General Election Everything you need to know about what to expect in the coming couple of weeks before Ireland's General Election. An Taoiseach Simon Harris has confirmed a general election will be called by the end of the week following recent confirmation of a November polling date. The Fine Gael leader confirmed on Tuesday that he would be calling for a dissolution of the Dáil by the end of the week. The election was set to be called following the passing of the Finance Bill, which passed all stages in the Dáil on Tuesday night with a vote of 75 to 55. With the election nearing, we here at Extra.ie have everything you need to know about what to expect in the coming couple of weeks. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! A General Election is the opportunity granted to the people of Ireland to decide who they want to represent them inside Dáil Éireann and what political party or parties should form the government. Members elected are called TDs (Teachta Dála) and the head of the government is the Taoiseach, who is assisted by the Tánaiste. A General Election must be called every five years, however the sitting government can call the election whenever they decide. Nothing has been confirmed as of yet, however last month Government sources said the election would be called on Friday (November 8) for polling day to take place on Friday, November 29. Ahead of the election, the Dáil must be dissolved. An Taoiseach Simon Harris will have to ask President Michael D Higgins to approve of the dissolution. An election must be held within 30 days of the dissolution. In order to vote in elections or referendums in Ireland, voters must be both eligible and registered to do so. Voters must be 18 or over on the day of the vote. Irish citizens and British citizens living in Ireland can vote in General Elections. To check if you are registered, or to register go to checktheregister.ie. If you are registered but need to make changes — such as change of address — you can do so on the same link. You can also apply by filling out an application form, which can be found here. Those who do not have a PPSN must apply via registration form and present to a local Garda station with the form and form of ID. The Constitution states that there must be a Teachta Dála (""TD"") for every 20,000 to 30,000 people in the population. Following a review last year, the number of TDs and constituencies will increase ahead of the next election. The number of TDs will increase from 160 to 174 while there will be an additional four constituencies, bringing the total number to 43. In order to run as a candidate you must be over 21 years of age and a citizen of Ireland. Candidates can run for a political party or as an independent candidate. A polling card will be sent to your home ahead of the election, which will include your electoral number and where you must go to vote. You may be asked for ID when attending your local polling station. Voters will enter a private voting compartment to complete their ballot. Candidates will appear in alphabetical order with a photograph beside their name and their political affiliation. Indicate your preference by writing ‘1’ beside your first choice, followed by ‘2’ beside your second and so on. You do not need to put a number beside each candidate. Ireland use the single transferable vote system in elections. The first step is to calculate the minimum number of votes needed to guarantee the election of a candidate, which is called the quota. The ballot papers are then sorted according to the first preference votes for each candidate, with those hitting the quota following the first count deemed elected. Their surplus votes are then transferred to the remaining candidates. If no candidate receives more than the quota of votes or a surplus is not enough to elect a candidate, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated. How is the Government formed after? A political party will need the majority to form a government, however if there is no clear majority there may be a period of negotiation where parties try to build a majority. This is called a coalition, which is what our current government is like. *This article was originally published on Extra.ie.",0,1

2024/11/7,"Ireland set to raise legal age of sale of tobacco products A Bill to increase the minimum legal age of the sale of tobacco products to 21 years of age is heading to President Higgins for his signature. The Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill 2024 passed through Ireland's Seanad today, November 7, completing its passage through both houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill will increase the minimum legal age of the sale of tobacco products to 21 years of age. The Bill will now proceed to the President for consideration and signature. Upon being signed, the Act will take effect on February 1, 2028. This allows a transition period to ensure that individuals currently eligible to purchase tobacco products, specifically those aged between 18 and 21, are not impacted. The Bill provides that current penalties for anyone convicted of selling tobacco products to people under the age of 18 will be extended to cover convictions relating to sales to people under the age of 21, including fines of up to €4,000 or six months’ imprisonment, or both, for a first offence. Ireland's Department of Health said on Thursday that the measure is being introduced in order to accelerate the decline in adult smoking prevalence, which has remained at 18% for several years, and to reduce smoking prevalence among children to zero. On enactment, Ireland will become the first country in the EU to raise its age of sale to 21. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Announcing the completion of the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas, Ireland's Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly thanked his colleagues for supporting the Bill and ""moving us forward toward the end of combustible tobacco products in our country."" He continued: ""Ireland has long been a world leader in tackling smoking, beginning with the workplace smoking ban in 2004 and continuing with a range of measures including restrictions around the sale, advertising and packaging of smoking products to make them less attractive and less available to young people. ""I look forward to seeing this measure enacted, to help our young people to avoid the lifetime of addiction and illness that tobacco smoking brings.""

""I have strongly supported its introduction from the beginning and I look forward to its enactment."" Professor Mary Hogan, Ireland's Chief Medical Officer, said: ""The enactment of this legislation represents another significant step in our efforts to reduce smoking levels. ""Tobacco smoking continues to be the biggest risk factor driving disability and death combined in our country, placing a huge burden on our health service. ""This measure will contribute to eliminating that ongoing threat and will support people to follow healthier behaviours."" Last December, Donnelly commenced section 28 of the Public Health (Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Act to prohibit the sale of nicotine-inhaling products such as e-cigarettes (commonly referred to as vapes) to persons under 18. In May, Donnelly commenced sections of the Public Health (Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Act 2023 that introduce a ban on the sale by self-service of tobacco products and nicotine-inhaling products, such as e-cigarettes. And in December, Donnelly signed a law to apply an on-the-spot fine of €2,000 for the offence of selling tobacco products or nicotine-inhaling products at events aimed at children. Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, Health Minister Mike Nesbitt has welcomed the introduction of the Tobacco and Vapes Bill at Westminster this week. The Bill aims to introduce a progressive smoking ban to gradually end the sale of tobacco products across the UK, so that anyone born on or after 1st January 2009 will never be able to legally be sold cigarettes. This means there will be no restrictions on people who can already legally smoke. The inclusion of Northern Ireland in the new Bill will be subject to the agreement of the NI Executive and support of the NI Assembly.",0,1

If you want to benefit from EU funds, then follow the rules and values that are part of membership.""

2024/11/8,"Former Irish senator Billy Lawless, advocate for undocumented Irish in the US, has died Billy Lawless has been remembered as ""a political force who made a difference in Irish and American politics over many decades."" Billy Lawless, who became Ireland's first Senator to be based overseas in 2016, died today, Friday, November 8. He was 73 years old. ""It is with profound sadness that I share the passing of my Dad - my friend, partner, and fun nemesis,"" Billy's son Billy said in a post on the Facebook page for The Gage, one of his father's restaurants in Chicago. ""I miss him with all my heart."" William Noel Lawless 12.24.1950 - 11.8.2024 It is with profound sadness that I share the passing of my Dad — my friend, partner, and fun nemesis. I miss him with all my heart. - Billy Irish Senators Victor Boyhan and Michael McDowell also confirmed their former colleague's death, saying: ""It is with great sadness that we learned earlier today of the death of our dear friend former Senator Billy Lawless. ""Billy was a member of our Seanad Independent Group from 2016 to 2020 where he served with distinction as part of our ten strong group of Independent members in Seanad Éireann. ""Billy was a tireless advocate for the diaspora and the undocumented Irish in the United States. He was a political force who made a difference in Irish and American politics over many decades, but above all, a husband, father and grandfather who will be dearly missed in Chicago, Galway and further afield. ""Former Senator Lawless greatly helped the cause of Irish immigrants and was made Freeman of Galway for these efforts. He was also conferred with an Honorary Doctorate by University of Galway. ""On behalf of the current and former Seanad Independent Group we remember Billy today and send our heartfelt sympathies to his wife Anne, children and grandchildren.""

Lawless grew up on a dairy farm in the west of Ireland. In 1977, he sold the farm to enter the pub trade and soon had success as a restaurateur and hotel owner. When his daughter earned a scholarship a college in the US, he decided it was time to follow his dream and move him and his family across the pond. In 1998, Lawless emigrated to the US on an investor’s visa, but in order to become a US citizen, he had to be sponsored by his son, who had married an American. In 2014, Lawless and his wife Anne finally, and proudly, became US citizens. In 2005, the successful Irish businessman who has had a lifetime interest in politics began to work as an advocate for immigration reform in the US, wishing to highlight the plight of the Irish undocumented community in Chicago. The following year, he took up the cause of getting undocumented immigrants driver’s licenses. Politically, this was risky move for a businessman, especially one working in the hospitality game. At the time, there were an estimated 5,000 to 7,000 undocumented Irish in Chicago but Lawless soon realized that his was just a symptom of a nationwide problem. He went on to take up the position as leader of the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights and eventually they won their fight for driver’s licenses for immigrants. He was later involved in the Illinois Business Immigration Coalition, convincing politicians, Republicans in particular, to support immigration reform. Meanwhile, Lawless established The Gage Hospitality Group in Chicago. Four restaurants are a part of the group today - Acanto, Coda Di Volpe, The Dawson, and The Gage. The Irish man's advocacy for undocumented immigrants caught the eye of US President Barack Obama. In 2014, Lawless introduced Obama at a Chicago event where the President was speaking about his executive action on immigration. “We really wanted to see if we could succeed in the United States and live the American Dream,” Lawless told the audience of 18,000 people in Chicago. He said at the time how he owned four pubs and employed 260 people. “This is what we emigrants do,” he stated. Obama said Lawless and his son Billy, who also ran the restaurants, exemplified what he was trying to do empowering immigrants. “Together, they have gone from employing ten workers to employing more than 250 workers and you just heard what Billy said: ‘This is what immigrants do.’” Afterward, Lawless said: “The Irish community welcomes his [Obama's] reforms on the one hand, but that we really want to see more permanent and more thorough change through Congressional action. ""I also said that limiting the new deferred action program to just those who have children was unfair. ""I shared that most of the initial reaction in Ireland has focused on the travel issue and an immediate expectation that undocumented migrants would be able to travel home to reunite with family, to see a gravely ill loved one or attend a funeral, at an early stage and not trigger a 10 year ban.” In May 2016, Taoiseach Enda Kenny appointed Lawless as Ireland's first-ever emigrant Senator, a role he remained in until 2020. At the conclusion of his term in the Seanad, Lawless issued this video where he thanked Kenny for creating the position of Minister for the Diaspora in 2014. He also said that he was planning on writing to all parties in Irish Government asking that a referendum on voting rights for the Irish abroad be included in the next Programme for Government. A referendum has yet to be held despite many promises. In a statement on Friday, Taoiseach Simon Harris said:"" It is with the utmost sadness that I have learned of the death of former Senator, Billy Lawless. ""Billy Lawless was a gentleman to his core, he was a businessman at the top of his game, and he was a person who accepted a challenge from former Taoiseach Enda Kenny - to travel from Chicago to Leinster House to represent the Irish diaspora. ""He did his work with diligence and great pride; he was great company, and he was an extremely kind man. ""To his family and large circle of friends and colleagues, I am truly sorry for your loss.

2024/12/11,"Irish Government approves Ireland's intervention in ICJ genocide case against Israel Ireland will be asking the ICJ to ""broaden its interpretation of what constitutes the commission of genocide by a State."" Ireland's Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin has secured government approval for Ireland to intervene in South Africa’s International Court of Justice case against Israel under the Genocide Convention. Filing of the intervention will take place at the Court in The Hague later this month, Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday. The Irish Government has also approved intervention in The Gambia’s case against Myanmar under the same Convention. Following Wednesday's Cabinet meeting, the Tánaiste said: ""There has been a collective punishment of the Palestinian people through the intent and impact of military actions of Israel in Gaza, leaving 44,000 dead and millions of civilians displaced. ""By legally intervening in South Africa’s case, Ireland will be asking the ICJ to broaden its interpretation of what constitutes the commission of genocide by a State. ""We are concerned that a very narrow interpretation of what constitutes genocide leads to a culture of impunity in which the protection of civilians is minimised. ""Ireland’s view of the Convention is broader and prioritises the protection of civilian life – as a committed supporter of the Convention, the government will promote that interpretation in its intervention in this case. ""Intervening in both cases demonstrates the consistency of Ireland’s approach to the interpretation and application of the Genocide Convention.” Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! According to The Journal, the Tánaiste told reporters on Wednesday morning: “Fundamentally, Ireland is asking the court to broaden its interpretation of genocide within the Genocide Convention."" He acknowledged that the issue is ""legally complex."" He continued: “We believe it encompasses what has happened in Gaza in particular, in terms of both the intent and in terms of the impact of the horrific Israeli attacks on the Palestinian people within Gaza in particular – where to 40,000 people have been killed, millions displaced, and there’s been a collective punishment of the people living in Gaza.” The Journal notes that by filing a declaration of intervention in a case, which must be accepted by the ICJ, Ireland would not join the case on behalf of one side or the other. Rather, Ireland may assist the Court by making submissions on interpretation of provisions of the Convention. Wednesday's Cabinet meeting was the first since Ireland's General Election on November 29 in which Martin's Fine Gael party won the most seats in Dáil Éireann. Talks are continuing amongst parties about Government formation. The ICJ announced last year on December 29 that South Africa had filed an application instituting proceedings against Israel, alleging that Israel ""in relation to Palestinians in Gaza, is in violation of its obligations under the Genocide Convention.” In January, the ICJ ordered that Israel take measures to prevent genocide in Gaza and enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip. Israel was also ordered to submit a report to the ICJ in one month outlining its efforts to adhere to the ICJ's orders. The Tánaiste ""strongly welcomed"" the ICJ's orders in January. ""These are measures that Ireland has been consistently calling for from the start of this conflict,"" he said on January 26. He added: ""As agreed by the Dáil earlier this week, the Government will strongly consider intervention in the case, following detailed analysis of the Court’s decision today. ""I have therefore asked my officials to prepare legal advice for my consideration on an urgent basis."" The Tánaiste had announced in March that Ireland would intervene in the case, though acknowledged that the intervention required government approval would could take months. In May, Ireland, in concert with Spain and Norway, formally recognized Palestine ""as a sovereign and independent state"" and agreed to establish full diplomatic relations between Dublin and Ramallah.",0,1

2024/12/19,"RIP.ie make pricing change after Irish Times Group acquisition RIP.ie's death notices will cost €100 from January, prompting criticism from funeral directors as well as Irish politicians. RIP.ie has made changes to its pricing structure for death notices, the first since the announcement of a takeover by the Irish Times Group. Funeral directors have expressed concern over the news they will now be charged €100 for every death notice published on RIP.ie. The fee, to be introduced in January, has been described by the website’s owners as “good value for money,"" adding that the funds will be used to “support the development and enhancement” of its service. But while the fee will be charged directly to funeral directors, some of whom have described it as “excessive”, there are fears it will ultimately be passed on to people who have recently lost their loved ones. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! One TD described the move as “horrendous” and said that the website is “seeking to profit” off death notices. Labour’s Conor Sheehan said: “Charging people €100 to post a death notice is wrong. “RIP.ie has become a crucial community tool for people up and down this country, and I am calling on the Irish Times, owners of the site, to reverse this decision.” Funeral director Joe Grogan indicated that the costs would likely be passed on to families. “It’s something that we can’t absorb ourselves,” he said. Mr. Grogan, who is based in Tuam, Co Galway, described the €100 fee as “too much” for families to pay. He also raised concerns over the type of content that may now appear on the site. “Funerals are a sensitive business, you don’t want to be seeing ads or pop-ups that have nothing to do with funerals,” he told RTÉ Radio’s Drivetime. “When RIP.ie was set up it was more of a personal family business, but you see it is more revenue-driven now.” However, Mr Grogan acknowledged that before the website was launched, funeral directors paid significantly higher costs for similar family announcements in national newspapers and local radio stations. He also questioned whether further price hikes are likely in future and what extra services will be offered to reflect these costs. A spokesman for RIP.ie said that the fee offers “good value”, remarking: “Investing in our service will ensure that RIP.ie remains a trusted resource for bereaved families across Ireland and for the hundreds of thousands of people who post messages of condolence to those families on the site every week. “The platform, which operates seven days a week, also ensures people can find key information about funerals and funeral-related services. “Having engaged with funeral directors and others involved in the sector, we believe the new fee structure offers fair and good value for money. “We have no plans to introduce a charge to users of the site. RIP.ie remains committed to offering an excellent service and a secure platform where bereaved families can be supported in commemorating their loved ones.” The website is one of the most popular in Ireland, boasting 3.3 million users last month alone. But high levels of website traffic often come with higher maintenance costs. Earlier this year, the Irish Times Group announced the acquisition of the deathnotice platform as part of its expansion of digital services and products. Until then, death notices on the website had been free of charge, with undertakers paying optional fees for extra advertising on the site. Following its announcement, the Irish Association of Funeral Directors (IAFD) has written to the Irish Times Group seeking clarity on the move. “When suppliers set prices beyond the control of the IAFD, which could affect our members and their clients, the association strives to voice any concerns on their behalf, as we aim to promote best practice and deliver value to both our members and their clients,” a statement read. Colm Kieran from Kieran Brothers Funeral Directors in Kingscourt, Co Cavan, told Northern Sound FM that some families may choose not to pay, and instead use social media as a means to announce the death of a loved one. “What you do see now is that funeral directors are starting to publish on their own platforms,” he said. “You’ll notice across the country funeral directors are taking en masse to having their own Facebook and Instagram pages where they can still continue to provide an online free of charge method by which they can publish a funeral notice for their community so there are free options still out there.” Labour TD Conor Sheehan has said of the move: “This is greed, pure and simple. At the worst time in someone’s life, the last thing people need to consider is if they can afford to announce the death of a loved one.” He added: “While the fee will be for funeral directors, it ultimately will be passed on to a grieving family. “The announcement of a loved one’s death should not be on the basis of financial means. “I note that the reason provided for this fee is to upgrade and enhance the service. “From my own experience and from speaking to friends and family, the website seems to function perfectly. “Particularly for people who are not digital native, it would be a regressive step to change the operations of the website and how it functions. “I implore a rethink on this decision.” Michael Moynihan, a Fianna Fáil TD, said RIP.ie was a “very trustworthy brand” and that it was used to get the news of the death of a loved “right across the country and indeed the world”. He said: “I think the difficulty with it is, if it is €100 now, what will it be in two years’ time?” “Funerals are an expensive time for families and we should all be mindful of that.” He said the cost seemed a “little steep” to him. Fine Gael TD Alan Dillon said he thought that the figure of €100 seemed “excessive” and that the Irish Times should “look at what is the appropriate cost of maintaining the cost of the website” adding that they should at least benchmark it against the cost of placing an ad on local radio in the funeral notices, which he said was around €25 per notice. He said that the notice and the messages of condolences had been a “real lifeline” for families experiencing grief. *This article was originally published on BusinessPlus.ie.",0,1
2024/12/19,"""Criticism is not antisemitism"" - Ireland's Ambassador to Israel responds to accusations Ireland's Ambassador to Israel asserts that ""criticism is not antisemitism"" in an op-ed following days of back-and-forth after Israeli accusations. Sonya McGuinness, Ireland’s Ambassador to Israel since August 2023, has responded to accusations waged by Israel that Ireland is “antisemitic.” In her December 19 op-ed for Haaretz, McGuinness said “we were deeply disappointed” to learn that Israel was planning to close its Embassy in Dublin. Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Sunday that the Israeli Embassy in Dublin would be closing “in light of the extreme anti-Israel policies of the Irish government.” As part of the announcement, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said: “The actions and antisemitic rhetoric used by Ireland against Israel are rooted in the delegitimization and demonization of the Jewish state, along with double standards. “Ireland has crossed every red line in its relations with Israel.” The announcement that the Israeli Embassy in Dublin was closing, coupled with Sa’ar accusing Ireland of being “antisemitic,” gave way to a back-and-forth between the two countries in the following days. Ireland continues to insist it is not antisemitic and that criticizing Israel does not make it antisemitic, while Israel continues to double down on its accusations. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Responding to the situation, McGuinness wrote in her op-ed on Thursday: “Ireland is not 'anti-Israel.' Ireland is not antisemitic. Ireland is not unsupportive of the desire of the Israeli people to live in peace and security.” McGuinness said that in the wake of the October 7 Hamas attacks, she recognizes “that for many of my Israeli friends, it is hard to have your country criticized when you are suffering.” However, she continued: “Cartoonish depictions of Irish policy do nothing to advance the just cause of mutual understanding. Ireland unreservedly condemned the brutal October 7 Hamas attack on Israel immediately and in stark terms. We continue to do so unreservedly.” McGuinness says that Ireland continues to call for the unconditional release of all hostages, adding that she knows “the vast majority of Irish people have no sympathy for the terrorists that inflict such pain on ordinary people just trying to live their lives.” Opinion | Ireland is not 'anti-Israel.' Criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza is not antisemitism https://t.co/X30SpiWWIw. Echoing statements issued by Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin after the announcement of the Israeli Embassy’s closure, McGuinness said Ireland’s “foreign policy positions are guided by the principles of international law and the obligation on all states to adhere to international humanitarian law.” She went on to explain what is driving Ireland's criticism of Israel: “The loss of so many innocent lives is unacceptable and contravenes international law. Irish people are seeing horrific images from Gaza on a daily basis. Thousands of dead bodies. Children maimed, missing arms and legs. Women desperately trying to find food for their families. Widespread destruction. “It is these images that drive the daily news stories in Ireland about Gaza and the calls on our government to take action. There is not in fact a spontaneous outbreak of anti-Israeli sentiment but a determined appeal instead not to lose sight of the ideals that your country was founded on at a time of crisis and suffering. Our criticism is not happening in a vacuum."" McGuinness continued: “We reject the view that the policy positions taken by the Irish government are antisemitic; criticism is not antisemitism. Antisemitism is a serious issue that deserves a serious response and accusations of it should not be made for political point-scoring. It is a real problem in almost every country and, in Ireland, we are committed to playing our part to combat it. ""However, attempts to undermine our considered policy with accusations of antisemitism are a disservice to the objectives of those who wish to work constructively with Israel and a disservice to the cause of countering the scourge of racism and hatred.” McGuinness went on to say that the Irish Government “accepts” that it holds a different view from Israel on how to achieve the goal of Israelis and Palestinians “living side by side in peace and security.” She also noted how Ireland’s views are informed by its own experiences of conflict resolution in Northern Ireland. “We have reaped the rich reward of peace – imperfect and built on hard compromises – and we want nothing more than for our Israeli and Palestinian friends to do the same,” she wrote. Concluding her op-ed, McGuinness said: ""Diplomacy is most valuable at times of difficulty,” adding that Ireland will continue to maintain diplomatic channels with Israel.",0,1
2024/12/2,"Irish General Election 2024: Counting complete, all Dáil seats filled The Irish General Election 2024 results are in and the top three political parties in Ireland remain unchanged since 2020. The counting for the Irish General Election 2024 concluded on Monday evening, December 2, more than 72 hours after polls opened across Ireland on Friday, November 29. The top three parties are unchanged since Ireland’s last General Election, which was held in February 2020. Fianna Fáil has won 48 Dáil seats this time around, while Sinn Féin won 39 and Fine Gael won 38. Each of the top three parties also saw gains on 2020 - Fianna Fáil is up 10 seats, Sinn Féin is up two, and Fine Gael is up three. However, the number of seats in the Dáil Éireann has also increased since 2020, from 160 to 174. The number of constituencies also increased from 39 to 43. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! With 174 seats up for grabs in this year's election, one party would have needed to win at least 88 seats to win the majority and thus control of the Dail. However, no one party fielded enough candidates in the Irish General Election 2024 to win the majority outright. As such, Ireland is likely heading for another coalition government, where parties come together as a bloc to reach the majority. The results of the Irish General Election 2020 also gave way to a three-way coalition between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, and The Green Party. Micheál Martin (Fianna Fáil), Leo Varadkar (Fine Gael), and Simon Harris (Fine Gael) all served as Taoiseach at different points during the outgoing Dáil. With a combined 86 seats, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will likely be a part of Ireland's new coalition government. While on the campaign trail, the leaders of both parties vowed not to go into coalition with Sinn Féin. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin said earlier on Monday before counting was finalized that it was contacting the leaders of the Social Democrats, Labour, and ""other progressive TDs and groupings this week."" With a combined 61 seats, a Sinn Féin - Social Democrats - Labour coalition would need lots of support from other 'progressives' to reach a majority. As parties begin to contact each other in hopes of forming a majority-winning coalition, discussions will now turn to a timeline of when Ireland's next Government will be formed. TD Jack Chambers, Ireland's Minister for Finance, told RTÉ on Monday: “I don’t expect a government to be formed in mid-December, when the Dáil is due to meet on the 18th of December, probably a Ceann Comhairle (speaker) can be elected, and there’ll have to be time and space taken to make sure we can form a coherent, stable government. “I don’t think it should take five months like it did the last time – Covid obviously complicated that. ""But I think all political parties need to take the time to see what’s possible and try and form a stable government for the Irish people.” Meanwhile, RTÉ News reports that Fianna Fáil won 21.9% of the first preference votes, followed by Fine Gael with 20.8%, and Sinn Féin with 19%. Voter turnout in the Irish General Election 2024 sunk to 59.7% from 62.9% in 2020. This year's election saw the lowest turnout since 1923, the last time the number was below 60%.",0,1

He also offered his thanks to the doctors, nurses, HSE, Irish Red Cross, WHO, the European Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism, the officials across government departments, and all who were involved in the operation. “There is no justification for the deliberate attacks on civilians and healthcare services in Gaza and the loss of life has been devastating,"" Minister Donnelly added on Friday.

The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population was also responsible for clearing all details relevant to the evacuation, including verifying the relationship between the patient and accompanying carer with the relevant authorities. The Umerto Primo Hospital in Cairo was used by the Irish team to assess the patients, and the use of this hospital was provided by Italian EU colleagues. The services of the EU’s Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) were used for the transfer of the patients from Egypt to Ireland. Ireland's Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin TD said on Friday: “The long-term impact of the physical and mental scars being inflicted on children in Gaza is unconscionable. ""Ireland has continued to work with our international partners, most notably UNRWA, to provide urgent assistance to people in Gaza. ""The medical evacuation of children to Ireland is part of our consistent support for the people of Palestine. ""I am conscious that many other critically ill patients remain in Gaza, and their requests for medical evacuation are being delayed or denied by Israeli authorities. ""This denial of medical care is unacceptable and must stop. ""Since the beginning of this conflict, Ireland has consistently called for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages, and a massive surge of humanitarian aid, including urgent medical care for critically ill children trapped in Gaza. This must happen. Children in Gaza cannot go into the New Year facing more serious injury and trauma.” Ireland's Department of Health said on Friday that it is estimated that Ireland will receive up to 30 pediatric patients in total from Gaza. The health needs are categorized under cancer, hemodialysis, and patients with other severe medical conditions (except for orthopedics to ensure there is no impact on HSE efforts to increase the number of procedures being carried out in this specialty). Ireland will continue to opt in on a case-by-case basis for each child who requires treatment, subject to the necessary capacity being available at that time, the Department noted on Friday.",0,1
2024/12/23,"A look at the partition of Ireland and its aftermath Irish blogger Gerry O'Shea examines the partition of Ireland more than a century after it became official through the Government of Ireland Act (GIA). The partition of Ireland became official when the Government of Ireland Act (GIA) was passed on December 23, 1920. The partition of Ireland, which was finalized with the passage of the Government of Ireland Act (GIA) on December 23, 1920, involved a momentous decision by the British government. Dividing a small island into two political entities based on religious affiliation was bound to lead to major problems, especially when a clear majority of the people living on the island did not want the country broken up. This division was a reluctant second-best option for the unionist/Protestant community in Ulster and for Prime Minister David Lloyd-George and his cabinet. The nationalist community of all political stripes in Ireland opposed any partition of the island. The unionists’ first choice was a continuation of direct rule from Westminster, but that was no longer an option after the passage of the Third Home Rule Bill in 1912. Fearing that they would be forced to accept a Dublin Parliament, they organized the Ulster Volunteers, a 100,000-strong militia who swore that they would die rather than obey this decision of the British parliament. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Led by James Craig, they demanded a Protestant legislature in Belfast with no accountability to any Irish parliament. Home Rule equaled Rome rule and they would never accept that in any guise. James Craig in 1917. (National Portrait Gallery, London / Public Domain) Their fears were justified because when power passed from Westminster to a Dublin government in 1921, the Catholic hierarchy was accorded far too much clout and importance. The unionists rejected a nine-county Ulster parliament because they feared that Catholics could outbreed them and end their dominance at a subsequent election. So, to achieve their permanent Protestant statelet, they dropped three strong Catholic counties, Cavan, Donegal, and Monaghan. Many of the 70,000 Protestants living in these counties felt aggrieved because they were unsure how they would fare as a minority under a Dublin government. The GIA was seen by all the parties in Westminster as a temporary expedient enacted at the behest of James Craig, and the dogged Ulster unionists. In fact, it did not acquire international legitimacy until the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Neither Tory nor Liberal Party leaders envisaged the partition of Ireland as other than a temporary arrangement. Love Irish history?

Getting to this point of dividing the country raised serious questions about the workings of British democracy. As the unionists organized and armed an illegal militia to openly defy an Act of Parliament, the ruling establishment in England seriously considered moving the army north to quell the revolt. However, in an unprecedented act of mutiny, a majority of the officer corps stationed in Co Kildare made clear that they would disobey any such order. Still, when King George formally opened the Belfast Parliament on June 7, 1921, he made a very conciliatory and magnanimous speech, pleading with his audience, nearly all Loyalists, “to make it an instrument of happiness and good government for all parts of the community…with fairness and due regard to every faith…a prelude to a time when, under one parliament or two, people would work together for the common love of Ireland.” Unfortunately, the king’s words were buried and forgotten before he returned to London. King George in 1923. (United States Library of Congress / Public Domain) The expansion of the franchise by the London government prior to the 1918 election extended the right to vote in Ireland to more than two million people, an increase of more than a million from the last time at the polls. Sinn Féin was the main beneficiary and they swept the board, returning 75 MPs out of 107. They refused to take their seats in Westminster and, instead, inaugurated their own assembly in Dublin. This article was originally published in Ireland of the Welcomes magazine. Subscribe now! While the Sinn Féin parliamentarians were focusing on establishing their credibility, the military wing of the republican movement, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), started a guerilla war to achieve the nationalist goal of total independence from England. This war was mostly fought in Munster and Connacht as well as in Dublin and a few parts of Leinster. Apart from the south Ulster counties around Monaghan and Newry where Eoin O’Duffy and Frank Aiken led active IRA battalions, there was no fighting elsewhere in the province at that time. General Eoin O'Duffy pictured in 1922. (Public Domain) The IRA claimed that they were not a Catholic organization and, in fact, the bishops in Maynooth, while supporting broadly nationalist goals, looked askance at the use of force to achieve these aims. Sinn Féin leaders pointed out that their fight for freedom followed in the tradition of Wolfe Tone, a Belfast Protestant and the father of Irish republicanism, and others who certainly had no allegiance to Rome like Robert Emmet, John Mitchell, and Thomas Francis Meagher. As part of their contemporary agitation, they were proud to name among their leaders Protestants like Bulmer Hobson, Alice Stopford Green, and Erskine Childers. Still, the ascendancy, the ruling class in Ireland, was drawn mainly from the Protestant community, who mostly identified with England and recognized its rights as a colonial power. They were the landlords who owned or administered the big estates and who held most of the senior positions in policing and the court system. In addition, they were at the helm of nearly all the big companies that provided employment in the cities of Dublin, Belfast, and Cork. Central to the colonial culture was a belief that the local Catholic people were dependent for good government on their English and Protestant overlords. One unionist historian of the time wrote that the poorest Protestant was convinced that he had a higher status than his richest Catholic neighbor. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The top republican leadership seemed befuddled by the Ulster question. Even Patrick Pearse, the nationalist revolutionary, actually praised the Ulster Volunteer Force for defying the English Parliament on the Home Rule issue. They shared with their British counterparts a sense that any political division of the country would not be viable economically and so would not last. At no time did they contemplate extending their military campaign to take on the northern unionists. Killing Irishmen of a different persuasion to achieve a united country was never on their agenda. Despite this rhetoric, recent research leaves no doubt that quite a few “Big House” Protestant families were targeted by local IRA groups. While the new state valued and protected Protestant families, the dominance of the Catholic Church in all facets of life largely explains the significant reduction in their numbers during the 50 years after the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed. During these negotiations in London the IRA leader, Michael Collins, pointed out that two states in Ireland could not be sustained. He was wrong in that assessment. The northern statelet is still around as we approach the December centenary of the Government of Ireland Act. Michael Collins in 1916. (Getty Images) He and other leaders of the revolution were hopeful that the Boundary Commission set up in the Treaty negotiations to determine the dividing line between the two jurisdictions would reduce the size of the area covered by the new Belfast Parliament by as much as two counties. In fact, the members of the commission visited some border areas and finally recommended that part of South Armagh be changed to Dublin’s jurisdiction with a section of East Donegal moving to the Belfast government. The Irish representative, Eoin MacNeill, resigned in protest and the whole effort ended in disarray with no jurisdictional alterations. Many Irish people believed that the partition of the country was a major contentious factor in the republican opposition to the Anglo-Irish Treaty which was passed by a narrow majority in the Dáil in January 1921. In fact, the core issues that emerged in the emotional maelstrom of that debate centered on the level of sovereignty won by the new state and the oath of allegiance to the English monarch that was mandated for all members of parliament. Partition was mentioned just once in the entire historical debate in the Dáil. Policing played a big part in the development of the new government in Belfast. The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), which took care of law enforcement in the whole island during the previous 100 years, recruited significant numbers from the Catholic community. After partition, the RIC name changed to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in the north and to the Garda Siochana in the south. The Catholic membership of the RUC decreased to around 16 percent and by 1960 that number collapsed further to just seven percent. In predominantly Catholic communities, anyone joining the police could expect to feel the sting of ostracism. The first prime minister in Belfast, James Craig, did not hide the fact that partitioning the country was the only way to retain the dominance of unionists in what they called Ulster. In his words, they demanded “a Protestant parliament and a Protestant state.” A long way from the spirit and substance of King George’s speech!

After that, he shoots up to Japan, over to Asia, across to Africa, then onto Western Europe (including Ireland!), Canada, the US, Mexico, and Central and South America. NORAD does note that Santa's route can be affected by weather, so it's really unpredictable. NORAD says it coordinates with Santa's Elf Launch Staff to confirm his launch time, but from that point on, Santa calls the shots. NORAD admits it can't predict exactly when Santa Claus will arrive in each country. However, NORAD says that historically, it appears Ol Saint Nick arrives only when children are asleep! In most countries, it seems Santa arrives between 9 pm and midnight on December 24, Christmas Eve. NORAD notes that if children are still awake when Santa arrives, he moves on to other houses.

2024/12/3,"When will Ireland form its new Government? With the Irish General Election 2024 done and dusted, questions now turn to when Ireland will form its new Government. Ireland's Tánaiste Micheál Martin does not think the country will have a new Government in place before Christmas - while Taoiseach Simon Harris last week spoke about the impact President-elect Donald Trump could have on the timing. Martin's party Fianna Fáil emerged with the most seats - 48 - of any party in the Irish General Election 2024. However, despite winning the most seats, Fianna Fáil was still far off from claiming the 88 seats necessary to make a majority, meaning another coalition Government is likely in store for Ireland. Discussions have begun amongst party leaders to see who can form a majority-winning coalition. The probability of a return to some sort of Fianna Fáil - Fine Gael coalition is high as together they have a combined 86 seats. Both parties have vowed not to go into a coalition with Sinn Féin, who emerged as the second-largest party with 39 seats, beating Fine Gael's 38 seats. Sinn Féin, meanwhile, said on Monday it had contacted leaders of the Social Democrats and the Labour Party and that it would be contacting other ""progressives"" during the week.

2024/12/6,"On This Day: The Anglo-Irish Treaty dividing Ireland was signed in London in 1921 The Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed by Irish and British negotiators in London on December 6, 1921, established a self-governing Irish state after centuries of British rule. Early in the morning of 6 December 1921, the ‘""rticles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland"" – better known as the Anglo-Irish Treaty – were signed in London by British and Irish negotiators led by David Lloyd George, the British prime minister, and Arthur Griffith, Dáil Éireann’s minister for foreign affairs. The two sides had been negotiating in London since 11 October. The frenetic final week of the talks ended with protracted meetings beginning on 5 December, during which Lloyd George threatened a renewed British war in Ireland unless the Irish negotiators agreed to the terms on offer. There are differing accounts of the precise words Lloyd George used, but the meaning was clear. After a final round of discussions and revisions that stretched the talks beyond midnight, the Treaty was signed, according to Griffith, at 2:15 am on 6 December 1921. British and Irish signatures on the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 6th December 1921, which established the Irish Free State. (Getty Images) Initially, the Treaty was only signed by those present at the final meeting in 10 Downing Street: Griffith, Michael Collins, and Robert Barton on the Irish side, and Lloyd George, Lord Birkenhead, Austen Chamberlain, and Winston Churchill on the British side. The Irish delegation had made their headquarters at 22 Hans Place in the fashionable London district of Knightsbridge, to which they returned with their signed copy of the Treaty at 2:45 am. The last two Irish negotiators signed it there: George Gavan Duffy and Éamonn Duggan who apparently signed it without taking the cigarette out of his mouth. Based on the description left by Kathleen McKenna, Arthur Griffith’s personal secretary, this is the document retained today in the National Archives in Dublin, and which is at the heart of their new centenary exhibition The Treaty, 1921: Records from the Archives. There is also a British copy. Later in the morning of 6 December, Duggan took the Irish document to Dublin, but in the afternoon, the British called at Hans Place seeking the remaining signatures of the Irish plenipotentiaries for their own copy. The absent Duggan’s signature was cut from an autographed copy of a programme for a reception held for the delegation at London’s Royal Albert Hall in October and was pasted onto the British text, where it remains clearly visible. But regardless of cosmetic differences between the two copies, the substance remains the same. The Treaty is over 2000 words long, consists of 18 articles, and established a self-governing Irish state after centuries of British rule. The first four articles defined the status of the Irish Free State that was to be created by the Treaty as having the ‘same constitutional status' as the autonomous settler colonies of the British Empire (the so-called ‘white dominions’): Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In a concession to reassure the Irish negotiators, the Irish Free State was specifically to have the same status as Canada. It would also have a royal representative modeled on the governor-general of Canada, and members of any new Irish parliament would have to take an oath requiring that they be ‘faithful’ to the monarch (article 4, in which the latter was specified, contained the first official usage of the term ‘British Commonwealth of Nations’). Two key issues emerged during the negotiations in London. The first was Ireland’s future relationship with the British Empire. The British were not prepared to let Ireland break away from the empire lest it set a dangerous precedent; this was the issue on which peace or war hinged. The Irish Free State was to be a part of the British Empire and this would, more than anything else, split the independence movement that had sought an independent Irish republic. The next few articles dealt with financial obligations, trade, and British military requirements. Then came articles 11 to 16, which dealt with the second key issue in the negotiations: the partition of Ireland and the existence of Northern Ireland. It is often wrongly assumed that the Treaty partitioned Ireland. It did not: Ireland had been divided into two jurisdictions in 1920. During the negotiations, the Irish had sought concessions on what they described as the ‘essential unity’ of Ireland, as they felt that an accommodation with the British Empire could be acceptable if they could secure a route towards Irish unity. However, the British were not prepared to coerce or undermine the new Ulster Unionist government in Northern Ireland. In theory, the Treaty established a 32-county Irish Free State, but Northern Ireland was given the right to opt-out, in which case a ‘boundary commission’ would determine the final border between north and south. This was the most that was on offer from the British. The Irish negotiators hoped that it would drastically reduce the size of Northern Ireland and make unity inevitable, but there was no guarantee this would happen. There were also provisions for a north-south ‘Council of Ireland’ to enable the governments in Dublin and Belfast to co-operate, but this never met. The final articles dealt with the transition from British to Irish rule, which was to be managed by a ‘Provisional Government’. The Irish Free State was to come into existence on 6 December 1922, exactly a year after the Treaty was signed, and it did. But much else happened in the interim. By December 1922 Griffith and Collins were both dead, and the 26 counties that became the Irish Free State were convulsed by a brutal and devastating civil war. The British had been prepared to use force to ensure compliance with the Treaty and closed off avenues that may have led to any compromise between the pro- and anti-treaty wings of the republican movement that would fight each other in the civil war. At the end of the negotiations in London in December 1921, the British may have gotten more of what they wanted, but the Treaty gave the Irish something that they could, in time, work with and build upon. Whether one agrees with it or not, the document signed in London on 6 December 1921 provided the basis for an independent Irish state, which makes that date a milestone in the struggle for Irish independence and makes the Treaty itself one of the most important documents in modern Irish history. *John Gibney is Assistant Editor with the Royal Irish Academy. ** Originally published in 2021, updated in Dec 2024.",0,1

""I have repeatedly stressed that international humanitarian law imposes a clear obligation on all parties, to all conflicts, to ensure the protection of civilians. ""It is absolutely clear that a military operation in Rafah, which has effectively now become one of the largest and most overcrowded refugee camps in the world, would entail grave violations of international humanitarian law. ""It is also absolutely clear that ordering the evacuation of 1.5 million people, who have nowhere safe to go, risks mass forced displacement. ""This can not be allowed to happen.

2024/2/12,"Irish construction workers abroad to be encouraged to return to Ireland to build homes ""Ireland needs you to help us build homes"" will be the message conveyed to Irish construction workers abroad as part of a new outreach. The Irish Government is reportedly preparing to launch an outreach campaign targeted at Irish people working in construction abroad that there are well-paid jobs available in Ireland. Ireland's Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris has been given €750,000 to launch a campaign aimed at increasing the number of men and women working in the construction industry, the Irish Independent reports. A key part of the strategy will be an outreach programme to workers in cities including New York, London, and Sydney to establish what the Irish Government could do to incentivize them to come home. The Irish Independent notes: ""Direct financial incentives are not on the table to attract workers back to the country but the Department of Higher Education is examining what measures could be used to make Ireland a more attractive place to work."" Harris told the Irish Independent that analysis by his department suggests an extra 50,000 construction workers across all trades will be needed over the next decade to keep up with housing demand. “We are currently revising those ­targets in line with the revised housing targets and an increased use of modern methods of construction but we will need more people to work here over the next number of years,” Harris said. “That is why we are currently considering a number of measures to boost the labour market, including peer-to-peer campaigns for people aged 18 to 24 to show the value of careers in ­construction and working with guidance counsellors also.

2024/2/21,"New Irish law will introduce ""soft opt-out system of consent"" for organ donation Ireland's Minister for Health said the Bill ""enshrines respect for the generosity of donors and their families, and respect for the dignity of the deceased."" The Human Tissue (Transplantation, Post-Mortem, Anatomical Examination and Public Display) Bill was set to complete its passage in both Houses of the Oireachtas on Wednesday, February 21, and will then be sent to Uachtarán na hÉireann for signing. According to Ireland's Department of Health, the Human Tissue Bill introduces a soft opt-out system of consent for organ donation. Under this system, consent for organ donation will be deemed unless the person has, while alive, registered his/her wish not to become an organ donor after death. This is a change from the current system where decisions on organ donation are the responsibility of the next-of-kin and assumes that an individual has a desire to donate their organs after their death unless they make a statement of objection to donation. Although the wishes of the deceased should be central to any decision, families will continue to be consulted as part of a safe and respectful organ donation process. The Bill further provides a framework for the donation of organs and tissues and cells from living donors including the introduction of a legislative basis for non-directed altruistic living donation. It is anticipated that these measures will help increase the donor pool in the State and will encourage organ donation to save lives in circumstances where this is possible.

""This Bill enshrines respect – respect for the generosity of donors and their families, and respect for the dignity of the deceased."" The Department of Health said the Bill represents a significant step forward in the regulation of human tissue use in Ireland.

However, later on Thursday, the law firm reported that Eljuboori learned in court in Baghdad that the charges against him have been dropped and he will be released on bail, though there are “two to three days of paperwork” to complete before he will be allowed to leave the country and return to Ireland. “This is a step in the right direction but there is a long road still ahead to bring Yasser home to us in Dublin,"" Eljuboori's wife, speaking from Dublin, said on Thursday. ""It is wonderful news that the charges have been dropped, but I will not stop campaigning until Yasser is safely home in Dublin airport.

Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O'Neill has become the first nationalist First Minister in Northern Ireland's history. O'Neill was appointed First Minister on Saturday, almost two years since Sinn Féin became the largest party in Northern Ireland in a historic election in May 2022. Speaking on Saturday, O'Neill described the return of the Stormont Assembly and Executive after an almost two-year hiatus due to a DUP boycott as a day that ""opens the door to the future - a shared future."" Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! ""I am honored to stand here as First Minister,"" O'Neill told Northern Ireland's MLAs on Saturday. ""We mark a moment of equality and progress, a new opportunity to work and to grow together, confident that wherever we come from, whatever our aspirations, we can and must build our future together. ""I welcome the fact that the DUP has decided to re-enter the democratic institutions and that the outcome of the Assembly election is now being respected."" The DUP boycotted power-sharing for almost two years in protest over post-Brexit trade agreements, stating that the Northern Ireland Protocol threatened Northern Ireland's position within the UK. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirmed the end of the boycott on Thursday after legislation passed in the House of Commons removing routine checks on British golds being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. Speaking as the first nationalist First Minister, O'Neill said unionist identity in Northern Ireland was important to her and added that she will be ""inclusive and respectful"" during her time in office.

Little-Pengelly congratulated O'Neill on her appointment as First Minister, adding that there is an opportunity to share Northern Ireland for the better. She said Northern Ireland can only secure a prosperous future if nationalist and unionist communities work together and said many families on both sides of the political divide face similar problems. ""It is those shared problems that are blighting too many lives, that we can work constructively, urgently together to improve,"" Little-Pengelly said. She said there are a number of issues that she and O'Neill can agree on, including a need to improve Northern Ireland's hospitals and reduce the cost of childcare. She said the two leaders also agree that teachers need to be supported, public sector workers need to be ""properly paid"", and the police need more resources to ""put the (drug) dealers out of business"". Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris described the appointment of O'Neill and Little-Pengelly as a ""great day"" for Northern Ireland, adding that democracy has been restored in the region. Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin congratulated both O'Neill and Little-Pengelly, describing their appointment as a ""special day"" for Northern Ireland. ""While the last few weeks and months have focused on restoring the Assembly and Executive, the hard work now begins in earnest,"" Martin said. ""Northern Ireland faces real challenges.

He was passionately pro-European in Government and in Opposition, and was well-liked and respected among colleagues in Europe and in the European People’s Party in which he served as Vice-President. He knew that Ireland’s place and destiny was at the heart of Europe and made the case for it eloquently. ""On the North, he strongly opposed violence as a means to advance political objectives and believed in unity through consent. He made a particular effort to reach out to the Unionist community. He advocated a new patriotism and opposed narrow nationalism. While these views are now held by the majority of people, that was not always the case and he was willing to lead, even when it meant going against the grain. ""John believed in an enterprise economy and responsible management of the public finances. I am convinced that the decisions made by the ‘Rainbow’ Government which he led from 1994 to 1997, comprising Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left, laid the foundation for much of the economic prosperity we have enjoyed since. ""A believer in individual rights and responsibilities and social justice, John was born from the Christian Democratic tradition of European and Irish politics. He was conservative but always compassionate and caring. He played a crucial role in the Divorce Referendum of 1995 in convincing middle-ground voters to vote Yes in what was a very tight referendum.

""So, Ireland will continue to call for an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and a massive and sustained increase in humanitarian aid, food, and medicine to the people of Gaza. ""We will also continue to call and to work for a meaningful political pathway leading to self-determination for the Palestinian people. A fully-fledged nation-state of their own, and homeland in the land of their forefathers. ""From our own painful history in Ireland, we know that a ceasefire does not mean surrender, nor does it necessarily mean peace, and it certainly doesn’t mean weakness. A ceasefire does not mean forgiveness either, but it does present a symbol of hope. It means breaking free of the perpetual cycle of violence, recrimination and retaliation. It means believing in our shared humanity instead of a need for revenge.""

2024/3/14,"Ireland's Taoiseach to meet with US President and Vice President in Washington, DC today Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is set to discuss Irish-US bonds and global affairs, including Ukraine and Palestine, with President Joe Biden in Washington, DC. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is due to meet with US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris in Washington, DC today, Friday, March 15. The engagements are part of a decades-old tradition where the sitting Taoiseach meets with the sitting US President in Washington, DC on or near St. Patrick’s Day. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on March 5: “On March 15, President Joe Biden will host Taoiseach Leo Varadkar of Ireland, for a bilateral meeting, followed by a St. Patrick’s Day Celebration at the White House on March 17, continuing a longstanding St. Patrick’s Day tradition. “The leaders will reaffirm the close and enduring partnership between the United States and Ireland and the extraordinary bonds between our people. “They will discuss our countries’ shared commitment to continue supporting Ukraine in the face of Russia’s brutal aggression, as well as our coordination on a range of other global issues, including the Middle East. “They will reaffirm their steadfast support for the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement as we welcome the recent restoration of Northern Ireland’s Executive and Assembly. “Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff will host the Taoiseach and Mr. Matthew Barrett for a breakfast at the Naval Observatory on March 15.” Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Despite calls for him to boycott the annual engagements due to the US response to the war in Gaza, Varadkar arrived in Boston on Monday for his weeklong St. Patrick's Day visit to the US. Varadkar had argued that it would be a ""big mistake"" to skip the US visit and that he would ""use the opportunity - in private, in the Oval Office and in public in the White House - to make clear how the Irish people feel about the situation in Gaza and how we believe the US needs to adopt an approach that will help to bring about a peace settlement in the region.” Speaking at the JFK Library and Museum in Boston on Monday night, the Taoiseach reiterated Ireland's call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. ""Ireland will continue to call for an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of all hostages, and a massive and sustained increase in humanitarian aid, food, and medicine to the people of Gaza,"" Varadkar said in Boston on Monday evening. ""We will also continue to call and to work for a meaningful political pathway leading to self-determination for the Palestinian people."" The following day, looking ahead to his bilateral meeting with Biden, Varadkar told reporters in Boston: ""When it comes to the situation in Palestine and Gaza, I'll be very keen to push the case for a ceasefire and, more importantly, to ask America to get involved, once again, in the drive for peace."" Varadkar again brought up the matter of Gaza on Wednesday night when he addressed the sold-out audience, which included top US politicians, at the annual Ireland Funds Gala in Washington, DC. ""And I want you to know that Ireland stands with democracy, stands with liberty, and stands with the rule of law. And we stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,"" Varadkar said. ""Further away again, there is another frontier, stained by the blood of the innocent and the tears of the suffering. ""The brutal and indiscriminate attacks carried out by Hamas on Israeli civilians on the 7th of October were vicious terrorist crimes and atrocities and there is no context that explains or excuses them in any way. ""As we sit here tonight in this wonderful building, Palestinian civilians, who are not responsible for the crimes of Hamas, are being subject to humiliation and starvation, and that is wrong. ""We as Europeans and Americans, that are at least in some part responsible for the troubles in that region, have a duty to do all that we can to bring peace and justice to the Holy Land."" Varadkar's address at the Ireland Funds Gala on Wednesday night was accused of being 'softer' than his address at the JFK Library on Monday. The PA reports that Varadkar rejected those accusations on Thursday: “There’s nothing I wouldn’t say here that I wouldn’t say back home. “But I think any time you speak to any audience, or any time you go anywhere in the world, you know, we have to get the tone right and tailor the message for the audience.”",0,1

2024/3/15,"WATCH: Taoiseach says in Washington, DC that Gaza ceasefire is ""well overdue"" Speaking of Gaza, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said ""I think none of us like to see American weapons being used in the way they are."" Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has reiterated his and Ireland’s call for a ceasefire in Gaza this week during his St. Patrick's Day visit to the US. Varadkar had several high-level engagements in Washington, DC on Friday, March 15, beginning with the St. Patrick’s Day Celebration Breakfast, hosted by Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff at the Naval Observatory. ""Regarding the conflict in the Middle East — triggered, of course, by Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack — Ireland has been a leader in providing food, water, and medicine to the people of Gaza,"" Harris said during her remarks on Friday morning. During his remarks, the Taoiseach said: ""And I believe you, Madam Vice President, showed great courage and leadership in recent weeks, when you spoke publicly in favor of a ceasefire in Gaza. ""I’m sure it can’t have been easy, but it was the right thing to do, and your words echoed all over the world. ""Like you, we call for the unconditional and immediate release of all of the hostages, a very significant increase in humanitarian aid — food, medicine, sanitation, electricity — and an end to the fighting by both sides, Israel and Hamas. And we support the work of the United States in trying to bring that about. ""There is a terrible humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza — a very human tragedy, which I think will haunt us all for years to come. ""In Ireland, we know how quickly atrocities can lead to calls for vengeance, creating new cycles of hatred and bitterness. But we also know that the cycle can be broken, and that new hope can replace old hatreds. ""The United States helped us to find peace. And now, let us work together to build a just and lasting peace in the Middle East for Israel, Palestine, and its Arab neighbors."" Later, in The White House, Biden, donning a green shamrock tie, agreed with Varadkar when the Taoiseach called for a ceasefire, a moment that made headlines on Friday afternoon. Varadkar told Biden: ""You'll know, my view [is] that we need to have a ceasefire as soon as possible to get food and medicine in ..."" Biden interjected: ""I agree."" Varadkar continued: ""...and to get hostages out. ""We need to talk about how we can make that happen and move toward a two-state solution, which I think is the only way we will have lasting peace and security."" Later, Varadkar discussed his bilateral meeting with reporters: ""Obviously aspects of the conversation were confidential, but I think it's fair to say that the US is working very hard, particularly with other countries and Arab countries in the region, to try to put in place a ceasefire for a number of weeks over the Ramadan period. ""That would be linked, obviously, to hostages being released and also some prisoner exchanges. ""But a strong hope and belief that if that could be achieved that there is the possibility then of something more permanent. ""And I know the US is using its influence on Israel to push that forward."" Varadkar added that he believes Ireland wants ""this to happen immediately because the humanitarian situation in Gaza really is catastrophic."" He continued: ""The President was very clear that the US would continue to support Israel and continue to assist Israel to defend itself. ""I don't think that's going to change. ""I think none of us like to see American weapons being used in the way they are. The way they're being used at the moment is not self defense."" He added: ""There's a difference between self-defense and what's happening now and that's why we need to move towards a ceasefire."" He further added: ""When I mean ceasefire, I mean yesterday. The ceasefire is well overdue. The level of suffering, the level of lives that have been lost, it's just too much. ""But a ceasefire has to be on both sides; has to be Hamas as well as Israel."" The Taoiseach, however, was not as explicit during the Friends of Ireland luncheon where President Biden also spoke. Varadkar said during his remarks: ""I’m also thinking of St. Patrick’s prayer today when he prayed for the wisdom to guide us, when I reflect on the catastrophe that’s unfolding in the Middle East — the savage attacks of October 7th in Israel, and the terrible violence and loss of human life in Gaza which has followed and continues.

2024/3/20,"Forgotten facts – How the killing of a British field marshal sparked Irish Civil War The killing of British Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, an Irish-born unionist, in June 1922 sparked the Irish Civil War - and was likely ordered by Michael Collins. On June 22, 1922, British Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, considered a great hero of World War One who helped bring that battle to an end, unveiled a memorial at Liverpool Street station in London to the 1,200 men of the Great Eastern Railway Company who had died in the Great War. At approximately 2:30 pm that afternoon, he was gunned down on the doorstep of his home in Belgravia by two London-born veterans of that war, men who had become IRA volunteers — Reginald Dunne and Joe O’Sullivan. The killing was very likely ordered by Michael Collins, as Wilson was a fierce Irish-born unionist who approved of the pogroms driving Northern Catholics from their homes. His murder sparked off the Irish Civil War and changed the political landscape in the most profound manner. Michael Collins. (Getty Images) Wilson was the first sitting MP to be killed in Britain since Prime Minister Spencer Perceval in 1812. News of Wilson’s killing spread quickly. Several MPs brought the melancholy news to Westminster. The press gallery was soon informed and a brief report was prepared for the wires within an hour and a half of the shooting. The assassination dominated the American evening newspapers that day and the following morning’s newspapers. It made the front pages of all the major newspapers, the New York Times, the New York Herald, the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, and the Chicago Tribune among them. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Since the Easter Rising of 1916, Ireland had been an issue that was rarely out of the American media. The gunning down of a British field marshal by two Irish republicans would have been a story in itself, but Wilson had also been the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) – the head of the British army when the Americans arrived en-masse in Europe in early 1918. Wilson was among the prime instigators of the joint Allied strategy with his friend Marshal Ferdinand Foch as supreme Allied commander. The coordination of British, French, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, and American forces culminated in the Hundred Days Offensive which ended the war against Germany in November 1918 much sooner than many had anticipated. Wilson’s death provoked universal shock among erstwhile comrades in arms. General John Pershing, the commander of the American Expeditionary Force in the First World War, said the killing “fills me with a sense of horror. To think that a man of his ability, who did so much in the world war, should be struck down by the hand of an assassin. It is terrible to contemplate. He was a personal friend and our associations were always most agreeable.” Major General John Biddle, who was the American commander in England coordinating a million US soldiers passing through on their way to the Western Front, was “shocked and grieved” by Wilson’s death. “I believe that next to General Pershing I probably knew him better and had more occasion to see and appreciate what a splendid officer and man he was. I had to depend a whole lot on the advice and assistance of Marshal Wilson.” Wilson was an Irish-born British imperialist killed by two British-born Irish nationalists. His killers Reginald Dunne and Joseph O’Sullivan were London-Irish. (L to R) Joseph O'Sullivan and Reginald Dunne before their execution in 1922. (Public Domain) Dunne was the son of a British bandmaster; his mother’s family was from Co Monaghan. O’Sullivan was from an “old Fenian family”, according to his brother Pat, who like his younger brother, joined the IRA during the War of Independence. The O’Sullivans were from west Cork. John O’Sullivan, Joe’s father, got a job as a master tailor in London, as did Pat O’Sullivan. “Our house in London was always a place of call for any of the men on the run,” Pat recalled in his application to the Irish state for a pension. “Why bring my family into it, not to boast, no, but to help you form a true picture. From 1919 on my whole life onwards was devoted to the fight for freedom; I will always be satisfied in my conscience that I did my duty for Ireland.” They were part of the Irish diaspora living in Britain who decided to fight for the country of their ancestors against the country of their birth. Love Irish history? Share your favorite stories with other history buffs in the IrishCentral History Facebook group. Historians have tended to focus on the role of the Irish American diaspora in the revolutionary period. The Proclamation references “our exiled children in America”. In 1919, Éamon de Valera went to America to seek support for Irish independence not to Great Britain. Yet the Irish diaspora in Britain played a critical and under-appreciated role in the Easter Rising and the War of Independence. The full extent of its support for Irish independence has only become apparent now through the release of the Military Service Pensions Collection (MSPC). Dunne, an only child, was attracted to Irish nationalism through traditional music. Britain was the “enemy country” and he exhorted his grieving parents to live in Ireland which they did after his death. In a letter to Rory O’Connor, then the officer commanding in Britain, Dunne revealed how he felt slighted as a second-generation IRA volunteer. “There is moreover a certain amount of scorn for men born over here. Some of these latter class have very little to interest them materially in our cause. They have everything to lose, on the other hand, and in many cases their own parents are against them. These men are fighting because of the blood that’s in them. Many of them are sensitive about their London accents and manners.” O’Sullivan told his father: “The felon’s cap is the noblest crown an Irish head can wear”. His father had no doubt that his son did the right thing. “I feel you know of my loss for which I have no regrets as it was done for the love of his faith and for Ireland. He removed a dirty Orange dog.” Dunne and the O’Sullivan brothers were able to use their London accents and wound badges to enter British army barracks and steal cartloads of weapons for the IRA. “I am an Irishman, born in County Longford,” Wilson had declared in the month before he was shot, but he was a southern unionist who regarded the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 as a sell-out to the “murder gang”, as he called the IRA. After his four-year term as CIGS ended in February 1922, he was elected unopposed as a unionist MP for North Down two days later. Wilson had been appointed military adviser to James Craig’s Northern Ireland government in March 1922. Dunne and O’Sullivan held Wilson responsible for the ‘Orange terror’ — the Belfast pogroms against the Catholic population which began in 1920 and reached a new intensity of violence by summer 1922. Both men had been severely wounded in the war. Dunne’s kneecap had been shattered; O’Sullivan lost a leg at Passchendaele and was fitted with an artificial limb. Given their disabilities, the attack on Wilson would be tantamount to a suicide mission. They ran away from the scene with police officers and an angry crowd chasing after them. The chase was witnessed by the American ambassador, Colonel George Harvey, who had as his guest the US Chief Justice and former president William Howard Taft. Both men heard shots and thought they were being targeted. Harvey, Taft, and former president Woodrow Wilson were among those who sent wreaths to Wilson’s funeral. His shooting would have disastrous consequences for Ireland. Since April 1922, anti-Treaty IRA members had occupied the Four Courts in Dublin, in defiance of the Provisional Government, which feared that challenging them would lead to civil war in Ireland. In May, Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera, the leaders of the pro- and anti-Treaty factions of Sinn Féin, announced a pre-election pact in which they agreed to field candidates in the general election of June 1922 in accordance with their respective strengths in the outgoing Dáil. The British government believed the Irish electorate was being deprived of a real choice. Acceptance of the Treaty was a prerequisite for serving in an Irish government, but the pact gave rise to the possibility those terms could be violated. A copy of the official IRA newspaper An t-Óglách had been found on Dunne. The paper was available in newsstands in Ireland, but it was enough for British PM Lloyd George to pin the order for the assassination — erroneously, as it turned out — on the anti-Treaty forces occupying the Four Courts. He wrote to Collins post haste that evening: “His Majesty’s government cannot consent to a continuance of this state of things, and they feel entitled to ask you formally to bring it to an end forthwith.” On the afternoon of the Wilson funeral, Winston Churchill (as secretary of state for the colonies) told the House of Commons in public what Lloyd George had told Collins in private. The occupation of the Four Courts, he said, was a “gross breach and defiance of the Treaty. If it is not brought to an end... we shall regard the Treaty as having been formally violated.” This was the ultimatum that forced the hand of the nascent Irish government. Six days after the Wilson shooting, the Provisional Irish Government opened fire on the Four Courts using borrowed British artillery, so beginning the Irish Civil War. The Four Courts in 1922. (Getty Images) The Wilson shooting was Ireland’s Sarajevo moment. Without it, there would have been no British ultimatum, no shelling of the Four Courts, no Civil War. Michael Collins would have lived, and the history of the new Irish state would have been different. The impact of the Wilson assassination has been underestimated, because of the assumption that the Civil War would have happened anyway and his death only hastened the inevitable. Yet, as IRA commander Florrie O’Donoghue remembered: “Despite six months of the talk of the possibility of civil war, no one had allowed himself to believe it to be inevitable, and no plans existed on either side for conducting it.” For the last century, many have speculated as to who ordered the shooting. My research posits that it was Collins himself who ordered the shooting of Wilson in retaliation for Wilson’s perceived role in the pogroms against Catholics in the North. Wilson died a hero in the worldview of those who had been on the same side in the First World War, but his posthumous reputation suffered grievously from the publication of his diaries in 1927 with a narrative by his friend Charles Callwell. The diaries revealed an indiscreet, duplicitous man who privately ridiculed many of his erstwhile allies. The book was especially badly received in the United States. Wilson described his namesake Woodrow sarcastically as “my cousin”. As an old-fashioned imperialist, he believed President Wilson’s view of self-determination for small countries was ridiculous. President Wilson was a “dangerous visionary”, “rather tiresome” and an “ass”. The pair met in December 1918 after the Armistice was signed. “He did not impress me in the least. He told me his grandfather and grandmother both came from Ulster,” Henry said of Woodrow. Wilson also revealed that Pershing had been privately “very open in ridiculing the League of Nations and he evidently looks forward to the president being unable to get a ratification”. The New York Times reviewer was understandably scathing about the book. “One by one the reputations of prominent figures in the World War are being destroyed by their own apologists or the shortsighted zeal of injudicious friends. The latest to suffer is that of Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson who book is one of the most sensational self-exposures in all literature.” *Ronan McGreevy’s ""Great Hatred: The Assassination of Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson"" is published by Faber & Faber, priced $27.95 in hardback.

2024/3/20,"WATCH: Leo Varadkar resigns as Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael Leo Varadkar will remain in his role as Taoiseach until a successor is chosen. Leo Varadkar announced today, Wednesday, March 20, that he is resigning as Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland and leader of his political party Fine Gael. Varadkar made the surprise announcement just after noon on Wednesday during a live press conference in Dublin. He said: ""When I became party leader and Taoiseach back in June 2017, I knew that one part of leadership is knowing when the time has come to pass on the bat on to somebody else and then having the courage to do it. ""That time is now. ""So, I am resigning as president leader of Fine Gael effective today and will resign as Taoiseach as soon as my successor is able to take up that office. ""I have asked our party general secretary and executive council to provide for the new leader to be elected in advance of the Ard Fheis on Saturday, April 6, thus allowing a new Taoiseach to be elected when the Dáil resumes after the Easter break. ""I know that this will come as a surprise to many people, and a disappointment to some and I hope at least that you will understand my decision. ""I know that others will - how shall I put it - cope with the news just fine. That is the great thing about living in a democracy."" After acknowledging there is ""never a right time to resign high office,"" Varadkar said that his reasons for stepping down are both ""personal and political."" He added: ""I am standing aside in the absolute confidence that the country and the economy are in a good place and that my colleagues in government from all three parties - Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, and the Greens - and the Oireachtas will continue to work hard for the nation's best interests."" He continued: ""I will of course continue to fulfill my duties as Taoiseach until a new one is elected and will remain as a constituency TD for Dublin West. ""I know, inevitably, there will be speculation as to the quote-unquote real reason for my decision. These are the real reasons. That's it, I have nothing else lined up. I have nothing in mind, I have no definite personal or political plans, but I am really looking forward to having the time to think about them.""",0,1
2024/3/21,"Michael Collins dismissed threats from Irish Americans days before his death Michael Collins wrote to his friend Diarmuid Fawsitt on August 19, 1922, dismissing the Irish American threats, saying ""let them all come."" Michael Collins dismissed threats from anti-Treaty Irish Americans in a letter to Diarmuid Fawsitt written on August 19, 1922, just three days before his death. The correspondence between Collins and Fawsitt was included in a tranche of materials donated by Fawsitt's family to Cork City and County Archives in 2019. Fawsitt, a friend of Collins, was a technical adviser for the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations, archivist Brian McGee told the Irish Times. Elsewhere, Fawsitt served as the first Consul of the Irish Republic to the US from 1919 - 2021, and after independence, he was a senior civil servant in the Department of Industry and Commerce, and a judge of the Circuit Court. On April 5, 1922, Fawsitt wrote to Collins saying he had received copies of cablegrams, “presumably from James K. McGuire of New York.” McGuire, the Irish Times notes, was a leading figure in New York with Clann na Gael, an Irish republican organization in the US that was a sister organization to the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), of which Fawsitt was a member and Collins was the leader. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Fawsitt wrote that the first cablegram read: “Am alarmed; report reached me your death ordered by Eastern Division I.R.B.; advise strongly close protection, watch out closely.” The second read: “Pay no attention to cable message this morning; investigation shows no foundation for warning; all well.” Fawsitt wrote: “Both messages were signed ‘James.’ “I quote these for your information, as they seem to me to show that our friends in the States are becoming somewhat panicky and alarmed on account of the political and military developments here, of which, no doubt, the American papers carry full, if not exaggerated stories these few weeks past.” In his response penned on August 19, 1922, Collins thanked Fawsitt for sending him the messages. Collins wrote: “I would ask you as a personal favour to tell him [McGuire] that he need not waste his time nor his energy in inducing any of the American Irish not to come here to slay Dick Mulcahy and myself. [Mulcahy, the Irish Times notes, was pro-Treaty, like Collins.] “I have not the slightest doubt that we should be able to stand up to such gentlemen as we did to other gentlemen of the same persuasion for two or three years. “It is a pity they did not show the same desire to come and help us when we were all fighting for our lives against the British. “It was then they let us down, and some of us are not likely to forget it, and are not likely to look their way for assistance again."" Collins concluded his letter: “Please tell this to Mr. James K. McGuire just as I put it, and tell him that my message to his friends is - ‘Let them all come.’” Love Irish history?

Cork City Archivist Brian McGee told the Irish Times: “Fawsitt, who was born in Cork in 1884 and died in 1967, was fastidious in keeping material relating to his involvement in many causes and organizations, and his papers have been kept with care over generations by his family and is a valuable addition to our archive collection.” * Originally published in 2022.

Ireland’s Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Minister for Defence Micheál Martin TD announced today, March 27, that Ireland will intervene in the case initiated by South Africa against Israel under the Genocide Convention at the International Court of Justice. Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said on Wednesday that following analysis of the legal and policy issues arising in the case, and consultation with partners, including South Africa, the Tánaiste has directed officials to commence work on a Declaration of Intervention under Article 63 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. The intention is that the Declaration of Intervention, which will require Government approval, will be filed once South Africa has filed its Memorial, the DFA said on Wednesday. ""This is likely to take a number of months,"" the DFA said. ""Ireland will liaise closely with a number of partners who have also confirmed their intention to intervene, as we prepare our intervention."" Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Speaking on Wednesday, the Tánaiste said: “Following the Provisional Measures ordered by the Court on 26 January, the Government confirmed its intention to urgently consider filing a declaration of intervention in this case with the International Court of Justice, based on a legal analysis of the Genocide Convention, the Court’s provisional measures order and consultation with other Contracting Parties. “That analysis and consultation has now concluded. Ireland will be intervening. “As I said in the Dáil last month, intervention as a third party in a case before the International Court of Justice is a complex matter and is relatively rare. Since 1948, only four other interstate cases have been initiated under the Genocide Convention before the International Court of Justice. Ireland intervened in one of these - the Ukraine v Russia case – and, after a rigorous and comprehensive process of analysis and consultation over the last six weeks, we have determined that we will do so again in the South Africa v Israel case. “It is for the Court to determine whether genocide is being committed. But I want to be clear in reiterating what I have said many times in the last few months; what we saw on 7 October in Israel, and what we are seeing in Gaza now, represents the blatant violation of international humanitarian law on a mass scale. “The taking of hostages. The purposeful withholding of humanitarian assistance to civilians. The targeting of civilians and of civilian infrastructure. The indiscriminate use of explosive weapons in populated areas. The use of civilian objects for military purposes. The collective punishment of an entire population. “The list goes on. It has to stop. The view of the international community is clear. Enough is enough. The UN Security Council has demanded an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of hostages and the lifting of all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale. The European Council has echoed this call. “The situation could not be more stark; half the population of Gaza face imminent famine and 100% of the population face acute food insecurity. ""As the UN Secretary General said as he inspected long lines of blocked relief trucks waiting to enter Gaza during his visit to Rafah at the weekend; ‘it is time to truly flood Gaza with life-saving aid. The choice is clear: surge or starvation’. ""I echo his words today.” Tánaiste @MichealMartinTD has announced that Ireland will intervene in the case initiated by South Africa against Israel under the Genocide Convention at the International Court of Justice. https://t.co/f3K6sU2hIN In December, South Africa filed an application instituting proceedings against Israel, alleging that Israel ""in relation to Palestinians in Gaza, is in violation of its obligations under the Genocide Convention.” In January, the ICJ ordered that Israel take measures to prevent genocide in Gaza and enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance in the Gaza Strip. Israel was also ordered to submit a report to the ICJ in one month outlining its efforts to adhere to the ICJ's orders. The Tanaiste ""strongly welcomed"" the ICJ's orders in January. ""These are measures that Ireland has been consistently calling for from the start of this conflict,"" he said on January 26. He added: ""As agreed by the Dáil earlier this week, the Government will strongly consider intervention in the case, following detailed analysis of the Court’s decision today. ""I have therefore asked my officials to prepare legal advice for my consideration on an urgent basis."" Earlier in January, before the ICJ issued its orders on the request for provisional measures, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that Ireland ""does not intend"" to join the ICJ proceedings. ""I really think this is an area where we need to be very careful,"" Varadkar said while speaking on RTÉ Radio. “What’s happened in Gaza is appalling - over 20,000 people killed, mostly innocent civilians, mostly women and children, very possibly war crimes committed both by Israel and Hamas when it comes to the events of the last few months. ""Genocide is something very particular. It is defined as an attempt, a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire nation, an entire race, or to do so in large part. “And one group of people that has experienced that in the world are Jewish people, the Holocaust. Six million Jews killed here in Europe, and Hitler had a plan to kill many millions more – that is genocide."" Varadkar added: ""We need to be very careful about genocide in that context.""

TD Mick Barry of People Before Profit said to Varadkar in the Dáil on Tuesday: “In not much more than a week's time, the Taoiseach plans to get on a plane, travel to the US Capitol and join Joe Biden in a day of celebration. ""He plans to give the latter a bowl of shamrock on behalf of the Irish people. ""He plans to pose, no doubt, for photographs with a man who has armed and financed mass murder. “That is the truth of it. I believe that is wrong. I am confident in saying that large numbers of people on this island also think it is wrong. “More than 30 million people in the US claim Irish descent. Many of their ancestors fled the kind of famine conditions now beginning to appear in Gaza. This is an election year in the US. The Taoiseach has the opportunity to exert some real pressure here. He should tell Biden that there will be no shamrock while there is not a total ceasefire and an end to the bloody occupation. ""Sometimes you have to stand up and do the right thing.” Responding, the Taoiseach reiterated the Irish Government’s call for an immediate ceasefire and said he welcomes the call made by Vice President Harris for a humanitarian ceasefire, which he says is a “welcome shift in the position of the US.” Varadkar continued: “On my visit to the White House, which will occur next week, I do not believe in boycotts. That has never been the approach I have taken to international affairs. ""The visit will present an opportunity to speak to leaders in the US on Capitol Hill and also to President Biden and Vice President Harris. “Ireland is one of 200 countries in the world. Not many countries are guaranteed a meeting once a year with the US. It would be a big mistake for us to boycott that and to lose the important engagement that has occurred every year since the 1980s. “However, I will use the opportunity - in private, in the Oval Office and in public in the White House - to make clear how the Irish people feel about the situation in Gaza and how we believe the US needs to adopt an approach that will help to bring about a peace settlement in the region.” TD Barry said: “In our view, no party in this House should attend a celebration with Joe Biden while this Israeli terror campaign is being waged.” He added: “Is the Taoiseach seriously saying that if bombs are raining down from the sky on the people of Rafah in their tents and if the noise and fury of a ground invasion is taking place outside those tents, that he will go to Washington and present a bowl of shamrock on behalf of the Irish people to the man who is more responsible than anyone else on the planet for arming and financing the military force involved?” Varadkar said Barry seemed “a little bit obsessed” with the presentation of a bowl of shamrock, which he says “takes about 20 seconds.” Varadkar continued: ""The real opportunity is in the sit-down meeting in the Oval Office with President Biden and his team. ""There is also the opportunity to speak publicly in the White House before guests of the President, as well as some from the Irish embassy. That is the opportunity I will take to reaffirm the importance of our relationship with the US on economic, political and cultural levels. ""I will also say there are issues on which we disagree, and I will take the opportunity to do so in private and in public. ""It would be a mistake for any Irish Government to boycott those events. Once that slot is lost, it would be easily transferred to another country, and it might never return again. We would diminish our influence in the world if we refused to meet people and refused to engage with them, including and particularly our allies and friends, such as the US.""

The initial drawings presented to the Tánaiste are the first steps in transforming public feedback into a new Irish passport book design, the Department said. The Tánaiste said on Friday, March 8: “It was important to see first-hand how the design team is transforming the public’s input into a coherent passport design. ""The Irish passport is a vital document of the Irish State that provides citizens with visa-free access to 192 countries. This redesign is fundamental to maintaining the integrity and reputation of the Irish passport worldwide. “As well as seeing the initial designs, I was also delighted to meet Boánn, the majestic wolfhound, who has inspired some of the intricate artwork that will feature in our next generation passport."" The Tanaiste added: “The Irish wolfhound was the most popular animal chosen by the public in our recent public consultation, and will feature prominently in our new passport. ""We share this island with a rich variety of plant life and a diverse range of animals and I look forward to seeing future design concepts as they progress.” Wil Byrne, Secure Document Designer at AG2, said: “It is a pleasure to showcase some of the early high-security artwork for Ireland’s next generation passport. ""The public's insights, Ireland’s rich variety of flora and fauna, and a range of complex security features are all being incorporated into the new design. ""Our overall shared ambition is to ensure the Irish passport remains a world leader by creating the most secure and visually appealing passport for Irish citizens.” Early draft sketch of the Irish wolfhound for inclusion in the next passport. The preview of the Irish passport book design comes a few months after the Tanaiste released a report on the public consultation on the design of the new Irish passport book and card. The report showed that the Irish Wolfhound, Red Squirrel, and Red Deer were the top three fauna selected, while the shamrock, gorse, and bluebell were the top flora choices. The Tánaiste added on Friday: “I would encourage anyone who is considering travel over the Easter break or this summer to check that their passport is in date, and to use Passport Online if they need to renew their passport or apply for the first time. Passport Online is the fastest and most convenient way to apply for your passport.”",0,1

The statement continued: ""The Taoiseach joined Micheál Martin, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, in planning/his intention to award additional prizes to terrorism, in the form of an ICJ declaration of intervention on the side of South Africa, the legal arm of the Hamas terrorist organization, and the possible recognition of a Palestinian state down the line/in the future.

Taoiseach Simon Harris has condemned Iran for carrying out an unprecedented drone and missile strike on Israel on Saturday night. Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian Consulate in Damascus on April 13 that killed two high-ranking commanders with Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Saturday's missile strike was the first time that Iran has launched a direct attack against Israel from Iranian territory. The attack caused only modest damage in Israel, with most drones shot down with the help of the US, the UK, and Jordan. Israeli authorities said at least 31 people were injured in the attack.

""It does nothing to help the cause of the Palestinian people or bring us closer to an end to the suffering in Gaza. ""There is now an urgent need for regional de-escalation. Further escalation is in nobody’s interest. I urge all actors to intensify efforts to restore stability. Ireland will work closely with our EU partners in responding to this crisis."" Iran warned Israel and the US of a ""much larger response"" if there is any retaliation for Saturday's attack.

2024/4/15,"Irish Government urged to fully decriminalize abortion by academics and activists Academics and activists in Ireland are calling for the ""full and effective implementation of the Independent Abortion Review recommendations."" The National Women’s Council (NWC) in Ireland, along with civil society groups, frontline services, advocacy organizations, academics, and doctors, have written an open letter to the Irish Government to demand improvements to abortion provision, stating that urgent action is needed to ensure the current law meets the needs of women and pregnant people. The open letter, issued on Monday, April 15, calls for the full and effective implementation of the Independent Abortion Review recommendations. The letter was addressed to the new Taoiseach Simon Harris, who was Ireland's Minister for Health during Ireland's historic 2018 referendum on abortion. He publicly supported the repeal vote. The letter says that changes needed include decriminalization, removal of the mandatory three-day wait, review of the 12-week gestational limit, and action on legislation regarding Safe Access Zones. As per Ireland's Health Service Executive, abortions are available up until 12 weeks of pregnancy, or 84 days from the first day of the person's last period. A GP or doctor needs to provide a 'certification' at least three days before an abortion is performed. After 12 weeks, abortions can only be performed in ""exceptional circumstances."" Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Orla O’Connor, Director of the National Women’s Council said on Monday: “In 2018, Ireland voted to provide compassionate care for women at home. ""The O’Shea review [published in May 2023] clearly shows that serious gaps remain in abortion care, resulting in significant barriers and distress for many women, with some still being forced to travel. ""We are calling on the Government to implement the recommendations of the review, without further delay, as well as all necessary legislative changes, to ensure safe, timely and equitable access to abortion.” The signatories of the letter acknowledged efforts to improve operational aspects of abortion services in Ireland in the past year – including 17 of the 19 maternity hospitals now providing care – but significant progress is still needed on many of the Review’s recommendations. Dr. Mary Favier, Doctors for Choice and START abortion providers group, said: “The three-day wait is a significant impediment to timely care and criminalization continues to stigmatize both providers and women. ""Community provision must be supported by a primary care lead focusing on evaluation of the service and targeted interventions to improve access. ""What needs to change has been well documented in the Review. It is time for political action and that time is now.” The signatories of the letter feel the recommendations in the Review have a robust evidence base, rooted in the lived experiences of women who have accessed abortion services in Ireland. They further feel that the onus is now on Government, who commissioned this Review, to act on these recommendations and ensure Ireland’s reproductive healthcare system is aligned with international best practice and can properly meet the needs of all women and pregnant people. The open letter was issued the same day that RTÉ premiered its new investigative programme into Ireland's abortion services. The UK charity Abortion Support Network (ASN) told RTÉ Investigates since abortion laws were introduced in Ireland, almost 1,000 people here have contacted it about accessing termination services abroad. In that time, ASN has spent just short of €314,000 supporting people from the Republic of Ireland to travel for an abortion. Most clients from Ireland are, ASN said, women affected by foetal anomaly diagnoses. The programme also features Marie O'Shea, the author of last year's review of Ireland's abortion services, in her only media interview since delivering her report. ""If you have to send somebody abroad, culturally and socially you’re framing it as a criminal and abhorrent act and that is in a person’s head,"" O’Shea said. ""I don’t think the electorate would want somebody carrying around that stigma."" O'Shea also said that she told Ireland's Minister for Health that the ""28 day [rule] is an absolute and utter nonsense. ""It’s cruel, and it’s too prescriptive. ""It’s not good law and it leads people to be in absolutely profoundly sad conditions."" According to The Irish Times, the Taoiseach told reporters on Monday ahead of the RTÉ Investigates debut: “In relation to the review of abortion services, of course I have personal views, but I’m not here personally, I’m here as the Taoiseach of a country of 5.3 million people. “I want to await the views of the Minister for Health and his department when they come forward to Cabinet and I also want to try to approach this issue in terms of trying to respect the diversity of views and bring forward consensus insofar as possible.” He added: “We had a very significant debate in this country, unlike other referenda, we published legislation. We told the Irish people if you vote yes, this is what it will mean. “Of course we also put in, and I was the minister who put this in the legislation, a review clause for this very reason so that people will continue to check their services [are] working as planned, you know, are things going as was intended. “I do think they need to be given consideration but that is the balance. The Irish people were given the assurance that if they vote for this, this is legislation you will get and then obviously there’s a review alongside that so I think this requires careful consideration.”",0,1
2024/4/18,"Stardust inquest rules 48 deaths in 1981 nightclub blaze were ""unlawful killings"" The verdict for the Stardust inquests was handed down in Dublin today more than 43 years after the nightclub fire killed 48 people. The 48 people who died in the fire at Dublin's Stardust nightclub on February 14, 1981 were unlawfully killed, a jury ruled today, Thursday, April 18. The jury, which returned its verdicts on Thursday at Dublin District Coroner’s Court, said that the fire in the Stardust nightclub in Artane, North Dublin began in the hot press in the main bar, due to an electrical fault. The time at which the fire began was not determined, but it was first seen between 1:20 am and 1:40 am. The Irish Examiner reports that the jury said that the polyurethane foam used in the seating and the height of the ceiling in the west alcove of the venue contributed to the spread of fire. The jury also found that the carpet tiles used on the walls contributed to the spread of the fire, and that at least some of the exit doors were locked, chained, or otherwise obstructed at the time of the fire. They said this impeded the ability to access emergency exits and exit through them for those who died. The toxicity of the smoke, the heat of the fire, and the lack of staff preparedness in the club also affected the ability of the deceased to exit the building, the jury found. The jury found that the club's emergency lighting system also failed during the fire and ruled that a combination of these factors caused and contributed to the deaths of the 48 victims.

More than 800 people were inside the Stardust nightclub when the fire broke out in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 1981. 48 people were killed and 200 people suffered injuries. Thursday's verdict was in stark contrast with the original verdict of the 1982 Keane Tribunal, which ruled that the fire was ""probably"" started deliberately. Families of the victims challenged that ruling and it was officially struck from the record in 2009. In 2019, Ireland's Attorney General ordered fresh inquests which began in April 2023. The jury, made up of seven women and five men, reached the verdict after 11 days of deliberation. The verdict was handed down the day after the jury's foreman told Coroner Myra Cullinane that they could not reach a unanimous verdict. Cullinane said she would accept a simple majority of seven jurors. Families of the victims cheered after the 12-person jury delivered the verdict in the Pillar Room on the grounds of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin on Thursday afternoon. Cullinane, who said the inquests were the longest-running inquests in the history of the Irish State, said that the jury had heard very difficult testimony. Cullinane acknowledged the relatives' ongoing grief and said the inquests took place largely because of their persistence. Responding to the verdict, Taoiseach Simon Harris praised the families of victims for never giving up on justice. ""The Stardust tragedy was one of the darkest moments in our history, a heartbreaking tragedy that occurred because of the lives that were lost, the families that were changed forever, and the long, drawn-out struggle for justice that followed,"" Harris said in a statement. ""Today, we remember the 48 people who lost their lives, all those who were injured, and all those whose lives were marked forever by the tragedy. ""For over four decades, the families of victims have carried the weight of the tragedy with unwavering strength and dignity,"" Harris continued. ""Their relentless pursuit of truth and accountability, their profound commitment to justice, even in the face of overwhelming challenges and setbacks, was not only a fight for their loved ones but a campaign to ensure that such a disaster never happens again. ""They never stopped searching for answers, for justice, and for some form of peace."" Harris said the Irish Government will now consider the verdict in full along with the recommendations of the jury. 48 people never came home from the Stardust nightclub in 1981. Their families never gave up on justice for them. They never let Ireland forget them. They ensured they were never alone. The country owes the families a debt of gratitude. pic.twitter.com/DNFR9sAf04",0,1

The victims' families received a standing ovation in the Dáil on Tuesday ahead of the apology. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Addressing the victims' families in the Dáil, Harris said: “I know that there have been many, many times when you thought this day would never come. Over far too many, many years. ""I know that you were forced to endure a living nightmare which began when your loved ones were so cruelly snatched from you in a devastating fire. ""Their unfinished stories became your story. The defining story of your lives and the lives of your parents and other family members who left this life before ever seeing justice. ""I am deeply sorry that you were made to fight for so long that they went to their graves never knowing the truth. ""Today we say formally and without any equivocation, we are sorry. We failed you when you needed us the most. From the very beginning, we should have stood with you, but instead we forced you to stand against us. He added: “I hope this is a moment when the State, which rubbed salt in your terrible wounds, starts to help you heal.” The Taoiseach described each of the 48 victims, who he said were “beautiful people” who had “plans and dreams, their whole lives ahead of them.” Michael Barrett, 17, Richard Bennett, 17, Carol Bissett, 18, Jimmy Buckley, 23, Paula Byrne, 19, Caroline Carey, 17, John Colgan, 21, Jacqueline Croker, 18, Liam Dunne,18, Michael Farrell, 26, Michael French, 18, David Flood, 18, Thelma Frazer, 20, Josephine Glen, 16, Michael Griffiths, 18, Robert Hillick, 20, Brian Hobbs, 21, Eugene Hogan 24, Murty (Murtagh) Kavanagh, 27, Martina Keegan, 16, Mary Keegan, 19, Robert Kelly, 17, Marie Kennedy, 17, Mary Kenny, 19, Margaret Kiernan, 18, Sandra Lawless, 18, Francis Lawlor, 25, Maureen Lawlor, 26, Paula Lewis, 19, Eamonn Loughman, 18, Donna Mahon, 17, Helena Mangan, 22, George McDermott, 18, Marcella McDermott, 16, William McDermott, 22, Julie McDonnell, 20, Teresa McDonnell, 16, Gerard McGrath, 21, Caroline McHugh,17, James Millar, 20, Susan Morgan, 19, David Morton, 19, Kathleen Muldoon, 19, George O'Connor, 17, Brendan O'Meara, 23, John Stout, 18, Margaret Thornton, 19, and Paul Wade, 17. The 48 who never came home. pic.twitter.com/ehTeNZPTj2 The Taoiseach also acknowledged the many people who were injured in the Stardust tragedy, the staff at the nightclub, as well as the first responders. He continued: ""In such shattering circumstances, the expectation must surely be that the State comes to the aid of its citizens and supports them in the terrible aftermath. ""Instead, it is to our great and eternal shame that far from the warm embrace of a caring State, the Stardust families experienced a cold shoulder, and a deaf ear, and two generations of struggle for truth and justice. ""Instead, it is to our great shame that State processes heaped misery upon tragedy for the Stardust families. ""I am so deeply sorry your first bid for justice ended with suspicion being cast on those who had died or survived on that catastrophic night. ""With your pain and grief compounded by stigma and rejection, the families were forced to fight for decades to obtain the vindication you won last Thursday when the inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing in the case of your 48 family members. ""For all of this, as Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, I apologise unreservedly to all the families of the Stardust victims and all the survivors for the hurt that was done to them and for the profoundly painful years of struggle for the truth. ""I apologise to the families that those present on the night of the fire were wrongly criminalised through the allegation of arson which was an attack on their reputations. ""I say today every person there was innocent. ""I say today the truth is now known. ""Not only were they innocent – they were unlawfully killed. ""The Government accepts the findings of the Coroner’s Court and the recommendations of the jury."" The Taoiseach said the findings were formally noted at the Cabinet meeting earlier on Tuesday and that the relevant ministers have been asked to report back on the implementation of the recommendations. He further said that he has asked his Department to ""prepare proposals to appropriately commemorate the disaster, as requested by the families."" Concluding, the Taoiseach said: ""The terrible reality is that we will never know for certain how many lives were ended by this tragedy. ""Beyond the 48 whose names we know, there were countless others whose lives were turned to ash on that terrible night. Their hopes and dreams were destroyed twice over. ""First by the fire, and then by the successive failures of the State to do what was right. ""And for that, I am truly sorry.""",0,1
2024/4/26,"Clare teen's death in Limerick hospital ""death trap"" ruled ""medical misadventure"" Aoife Johnston, 16, died after presenting at the Emergency Department of University Hospital Limerick two days earlier with suspected sepsis. An inquest into the death of Aoife Johnston, the 16-year-old who died from meningitis at University Hospital Limerick in December 2022, returned a verdict of medical misadventure on Thursday, April 25. Johnston, from Shannon in Co Clare, died on December 19, 2022, after presenting at the Emergency Department of University Hospital Limerick two days previous with suspected sepsis. In the hospital, she faced a lengthy wait for treatment despite displaying severe symptoms. The teenager ultimately waited more than 15 hours to receive antibiotics, which would likely have saved her, the inquest heard. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The inquest into Johnston's death took place over four days at Kilmallock Courthouse in Co Limerick and was attended by her parents’ siblings, relatives, and friends. Dr. Jim Gray, who was the consultant on call at UHL the weekend of Johnston's death, told the court during the inquest that the ED was ""like a death trap"" on the weekend the teenager died. He said that he was asked to attend the emergency department on the night of December 17, the night Johnston's parents brought her to the hospital after being referred by a GP, due to the immense pressure on staff. He said that he was not made aware of any specific cases and that he worked in the hospital's clinical decision unit throughout the day on Sunday, December 18. He told the court that the system ""failed"" Johnston. ""Had I known there was a 16-year-old child in septic shock, a Category 2 patient, who couldn't get into the resus room, the system failed her, the ED failed her, but if I had known there was a patient like that in the department, I would have come in,"" Dr. Gray told the inquest, according to RTE News. ""The problem is I wasn’t asked about a specific case."" Dr. Gray said the ED at UHL is ""consistently the worst in the country"" and that Johnston received care without dignity or privacy. ""It's an abuse of human rights,"" Dr. Gray told the inquest. Limerick Coroner John McNamara delivered the verdict of medical misadventure after hearing four days of evidence at Kilmallock Courthouse on Thursday. McNamara said there were systemic failures, missed opportunities, and breakdowns in communications throughout Johnston's time in the ED, adding that he remains concerned by ongoing problems at the hospital. McNamara also issued a number of recommendations related to the future management of suspected sepsis patients at University Hospital Limerick. He also issued recommendations related to how the hospital can trigger an escalation of services during emergency situations such as Johnston's. Speaking outside Kilmallock Courthouse on Thursday, Aoife's older sister Meagan told reporters through tears: ""I will never forget Aoife - she was just the best sister ever. ""It kills me all the time that I never got to say goodbye to her. ""When I got that call, Aoife was already gone. I'll never forget that drive into to the ICU. ""I immediately made my boyfriend drive me in there to see my sister. ""I never got to say goodbye to my little sister. I never go to say goodbye to her - she was gone. ""I never got to see my sister complete her Leaving Cert, I never got to see my sister do her graduation, I never got to see my sister moving onto the next chapter with her boyfriend, he's left heartbroken. ""When I knew Aoife was in hospital, I thought she was going to be okay. And then the next morning to get a call that she's in ICU, I didn't know what to do. ""That's my baby sister. And we never get to see her again. ""But I'm just so grateful. She was a beautiful girl inside and out. She's just an amazing person and I'll cherish the memories of her forever and forever. ""I'm just so sorry, Aoife, what happened to you. My mom and dad did everything they could for her."" Aoife's mother Carol told reporters on Thursday: ""We welcome the verdict and apologies but it's not going to change anything. ""Aoife's gone and that's what we have to live with now."" She added: ""We brought Aoife where we told her she would be looked after, but she wasn't. We told her she was in the best place. Get some rest. The doctors will be here soon. And the doctors never came."" When asked what she hopes Aoife's legacy will be, her mother said: ""Aoife is remembered at the minute as a girl who died on a trolley, that's how Aoife's known at the minute. ""But I suppose, in time, when me and James can talk to someone properly, people will get to know the real Aoife, the lovely 16-year-old girl, and our baby, and who we loved very, very much, and her sisters loved her very much. ""You'll get to know Aoife then, not the 16-year-old girl who died on a trolley."" Ireland's Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has offered his condolences to the Johnston family. ""I wish to offer my sincere condolences to Aoife's parents and sisters who tragically lost their daughter and sister in University Hospital Limerick,"" Donnelly said in a statement. ""I met with Aoife’s parents in January and my thoughts are with them after what must have been an immensely difficult week. ""I would like to thank the coroner for all his work this week, but I am aware that nothing will ever make up for the enormous loss the Johnston family has experienced."" Donnelly said he will ensure that McNamara's recommendations are ""fully considered,"" adding that he will also consider the verdict of former Chief Justice Frank Clarke, who is due to conclude an independent investigation in the coming weeks. HSE Chief Executive Bernard Gloster also extended his ""heartfelt sympathy"" to the Johnston family on Thursday. ""I want to take this opportunity to restate for the record today our unequivocal apology to them, conscious that no words of mine will take away their pain,"" Gloster said, adding that he will also take McNamara and Clarke's recommendations into account. ""I know we have considerable work to do to ensure that the people of the midwest, and the staff of University Hospital Limerick, have a service they can feel confident in and proud of, and we are working to that end. ""The details of this inquest will be very much in our minds as we do so.""",0,1
2024/4/27,"How the 1916 Easter Rising gave way to Ireland's War of Independence For many, the differences between the three-year Irish War of Independence and the 1916 Easter Rising become blurred. Ireland's War of Independence is sometimes confused with the 1916 Easter Rising - the two are different but related. The conflict between British forces and Irish volunteers escalated in earnest in 1920 and the centenaries of several key moments in Ireland's bid for freedom were marked in 2020. However, the Irish War of Independence and Ireland's 1916 Easter Rising often get blurred together with the passage of time. It's important to make the distinction between two different, but related, Irish revolutions because, to those who didn't grow up with an education in Irish history, the difference between the ill-fated Easter Rising and the successful War of Independence can get a little confusing. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The close proximity of the two revolutions, coupled with the fact that many of the leaders of Ireland's bid for freedom also fought on Easter week in 1916, means that the two conflicts are synonymous with one another. But there were almost three years between the last shots of the Rising in Dublin and the first shots of the War of Independence in Soloheadbeg, Tipperary. Dublin City was ruined by the conflict in 1916 It is important, therefore, to look at the two conflicts as two separate events where the Rising had a significant bearing on what came next, rather than viewing them as two entirely separate conflicts or one continuous war. On the face of it, they are almost polar opposites of one another. The 1916 Rising was borne out of Britain's ongoing war with Germany and the opportunities that it presented, among other things. The rebels were overwhelmingly vilified by the Irish public who looked on viewed them as responsible for the destruction of Dublin City and the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians. During the War of Independence, on the other hand, Irish rebels had almost complete support from the Irish people. Many rebels were sheltered by civilians in safe houses across the country in their fight against the Black and Tans, the Royal Irish Constabulary [RIC] and other occupying forces. That seismic shift in public sentiment can be largely, but not exclusively, attributed to the events directly after the Easter Rising, when British authorities made the fatal decision to execute the leaders of the upstart without trial. The executions of James Connolly, who was so badly wounded he was a shout in a chair, and Joseph Mary Plunkett, who was married on the eve of his execution, were particularly harsh and whipped the Irish public into a frenzy. To paraphrase W.B. Yeats, one of Ireland's greatest poets, the political landscape in Ireland was ""changed, changed utterly."" A terrible beauty was born. James Connolly Other events, like the plan to introduce conscription in Ireland in 1918, helped to deepen the divide between the Irish people and the British Government, but the execution and martyring of 1916's leaders turn public opinion irreversibly and gave Ireland an unstoppable momentum towards achieving its independence. It was this dual-blunder of the 1916 executions and the introduction of conscription in 1918 that gave rise to Sinn Féin's popularity. In the 1918 British general election, Sinn Féin would win 73 seats out of 105 available on the island of Ireland - a staggering feat considering they were only founded a year previously. Sinn Féin vowed to fight for an independent Ireland, showing that the people of Ireland overwhelmingly rejected British rule in Ireland. In a tradition that continues to this day, Sinn Féin did not take their seats in the British parliament in Westminster but instead set up Dáil Éireann in January 1919. This would give the Irish rebels something that their counterparts in 1916 did not have; a political wing that could be sent to negotiate when the time came. Coincidentally, the first shots of the War of Independence were fired on the same day that the Dáil sat for its first session. So, with the will of the people and an elected government behind them, Ireland's latest band of rebels had more hope than ever before of winning independence from the United Kingdom. That is another key difference between the Easter Rising and the War of Independence. The leaders of the 1916 Rising knew they would be defeated and knew they would likely meet their ends, but they carried on regardless in the hope their efforts would inspire others. And that is exactly what transpired. Soldiers during the 1916 Rising, like Michael Collins, rose to prominence during the War of Independence. They had been interned in Prisoner of War camps as retribution for their part in the Rising, but were released to appease the growing discord among the Irish public. Michael Collins This partially accounts for the lengthy gap between the Rising's end and the War of Independence's beginning. Collins himself was interned in Frongock Prison Camp in Wales and it was there that he began to think about different forms of warfare to hurt the superior British forces. While the 1916 Rising was a grandiose act of war designed to attract the attention of the world, the War of Independence was a series of gritty skirmishes with few, if any, instances of a traditional battle. Collins organized his troops into 'flying columns', comprised of between 20 and 100 men. The idea was to employ hit and run tactics on small targets like RIC barracks or British intelligence officers and then disappear into large crowds. It was this guerrilla warfare that leveled the playing field between the inferior Irish forces and the vast expanses of the British Empire and 1920 saw an escalation in that warfare. From Black and Tans to British spies and from the original Bloody Sunday to IRA ambushes, 1920 saw some of the most significant moments in recent Irish history. *Originally published in February 2020, updated in April 2024.",0,1

But politics is not about the office holder. This is not about me; it’s about all of us working together to serve the people. “We as a people, we as a country, have over the last 100 years worked tirelessly together to create our own future. “Collectively, this country can and should be proud of the progress it has made. “The number of people with a job is higher than ever before.

""To use its benefits to deliver tangible outcomes to society.” Harris said he plans to recommit to building more homes and driving home ownership, work to support the delivery of Slaintecare, prioritize the delivery of mental health services, and a “step change” in how Ireland cares for its older people. The new Taoiseach also made mention of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, saying: “This is a time of great challenge in the world, a time when leadership matters. “In Ukraine we see a brave and courageous people standing firm against unprovoked war and aggression. “In Gaza we are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe. ""We see innocent children, women, and men being starved and slaughtered. ""We have not been silent on the unforgiveable terrorist actions of Hamas on October the 7th.

2024/5/13,"Ireland could be raising age to purchase tobacco products from 18 Ireland's Minister for Health will seek Cabinet approval for legislation in a bid to significantly reduce smoking prevalence and addiction. Ireland's Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has introduced new legislation that proposes raising the legal age for buying cigarettes and other tobacco products from 18 to 21. Donnelly will seek Cabinet approval for the legislation during the week in a bid to significantly reduce smoking prevalence and addiction. The bill will be designed so that it does not affect people aged between 18 and 21 who are currently able to buy cigarettes and tobacco products. Donnelly first announced his intention to raise the legal age to buy tobacco products in March, stating that the legislation is specifically aimed at people aged between 15 and 17 years of age. ""Really it's a measure aimed at people who are 15, 16, 17 years of age that with a smoking age at 18, they find it relatively easy to buy cigarettes...but that if you move to 21 it makes it much more difficult,"" Donnelly said. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Tánaiste Micheál Martin welcomed the ""significant"" legislation and said there is an opportunity to build on the progress made over the past 20 years in reducing the prevalence of smoking in Ireland. ""There is an opportunity there to press home the possibilities of really eliminating smoking among younger generations into the future,"" Martin said on Monday. Martin also addressed the need to tackle the use of vapes among young people, stating that the Irish Government has to ""intervene"". ""We have to act. It seems to me the same playbook is at play that the tobacco industry did in the 1950s and 1960s, getting young people addicted to cigarettes and creating generations of disease,"" Martin told reporters in Cork. ""Potentially the same playbook here with young people being incentivized by flavorings, positioning, and presentation of the product and potentially long term hard, we have to intervene at this stage."" A report produced by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland Policy Group (RCPI) found that experimentation with smoking is highest among teens aged between 15 and 17. The ""Tobacco 21"" report found that raising the legal age for the sale of tobacco products in Ireland could cut smoking rates among teenagers by 25% and greatly reduce the number of teenagers and young adults addicted to tobacco. The report additionally stated that around 4,500 people die in Ireland every year from the effects of smoking, while thousands more suffer from smoke-related diseases such as cancer and COPD. The report stated that smoking is the leading cause of early death in Ireland. Chris Macey, Director of Advocacy and Patient Support with the Irish Heart Foundation, told RTÉ's Morning Ireland that the legislation was one of the most important healthcare measures introduced in Ireland in recent years. ""We would regard this as one of the most important public health measures for years and really a crucial step to protect the next generation from the deadly effects of smoking,"" Macey said. ""As a nation and as a Government, we sort of lost our way in tobacco control for many years and this really changes the dial or will change the dial back in the right direction."" The Government is also set to introduce a ban on the sale of tobacco and vape products from vending machines, while further legislation to ban disposable vapes and address issues around vape flavoring and packaging is also under consideration.",0,1

2024/5/16,"Two bills seeking to add Ireland to E3 visa program introduced in US Congress The long-running battle to secure Irish access to the E3 visa program continues this week as new bills were introduced in US Congress. Two bills seeking to add Ireland to the E3 nonimmigrant visa program have been introduced in the US House of Representatives this week. The first bill, introduced on May 14, is sponsored by Representative Richard Neal (D-MA) and cosponsored by Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA). The two, who are co-chairs of the Congressional Friends of Ireland Caucus, previously introduced similar legislation in 2022. The second bill, introduced on May 15, is sponsored by Representative Mike Lawler (D-NY) and is cosponsored by Representative Kevin Mullin (D-CA). Both bills have been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The efforts to add Ireland to the E3 Visa program have been running for years. Legislation nearly passed in 2018 but was narrowly defeated. In May 2019, Neal reintroduced legislation to grant Irish access to the E3 visa program - it unanimously passed the House in March 2020 but was never voted upon in the US Senate. Neal and Kelly again reintroduced legislation in 2022, however, it lapsed when Congress concluded at the end of the year. Introduced in 2005 as part of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA), the E3 visa program makes 10,500 visas available to skilled Australian nationals annually. However, Australians use only roughly half of the available visas each year. ""In broad strokes, this bill would enable qualified Irish workers to access the unused Australian E-3 visas going forward,"" Congressmen Neal and Kelly said in a joint statement this week, according to The Irish Echo. The statement added: ""E-3 visas are limited to professionals visiting the United States to perform services in 'specialty occupations' in a confirmed job from a U.S. employer. Under the agreement reached with the Australians, the applicant must have university degree, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the United States. The E-3 visa allows the holder to stay in America for two years with an option to renew."" Congressman Neal said in the statement that the legislation would ""further strengthen"" the relationship between Ireland and the US and would create ""significant opportunities"" for both countries. The efforts to add Ireland to the E3 Visa program have been running for years. Legislation nearly passed in 2018 but was narrowly defeated. In May 2019, Neal reintroduced legislation to grant Irish access to the E3 visa program - it unanimously passed the House in March 2020 but was never voted upon in the US Senate. Neal and Kelly again reintroduced legislation in 2022, however, it lapsed when Congress concluded at the end of the year. Last summer, Tánaiste Micheál Martin provided an update regarding the E3 visa in the US. After noting that the reintroduction in 2022 was ""welcome,"" Martin said: ""The Government strongly advocated for this proposal which, if passed, would bring about new two-way traffic between Ireland and the United States that could impact positively on economic, cultural, and people-to-people ties,"" the Tánaiste said. ""New immigration flows would also reinvigorate Irish communities across the United States and, overall, add to the vibrancy of our sizeable Irish diaspora in the US. ""While the Government continues to support efforts to get an ‘Irish specific’ category of E3 visa, the challenges to enactment should not be underestimated. Almost every US legislative proposal related to immigration reform in the last decade has stalled in Congress. ""Nonetheless, I will continue to take all opportunities to develop new immigration pathways for Irish people who wish to live and work in the United States.""",0,1

More recently, Robinson joined The Elders in April in calling upon ""political leaders who have influence to use their leverage to end Israel’s atrocities in Gaza by suspending arms sales, to secure the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas, and to compel the parties to commit to a permanent ceasefire and the two-state solution.

""We here in Ireland took a decision this week along with Norway and Spain to recognise the state of Palestine and we did so to keep the hope and the destination of the two-state solution alive whilst others are seeking to really bomb that into oblivion."" He added that the Israeli offensive ""absolutely needs to stop."" Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Harris also criticized the treatment of Sonya McGuinness, Ireland's Ambassador to Israel, who was summoned to the Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry and reprimanded over Ireland's decision to recognize Palestine. ""The way that our ambassador in Israel was treated this week is utterly unacceptable. It is not normal diplomatic practice to parade ambassadors in front of cameras and video them whilst watching a film,"" Harris said. ""And that's not how Ireland treats ambassadors based here and we never would. We don't expect our ambassadors across the world to be treated like that. ""It's just unacceptable. we've conveyed this in the strongest possible and appropriate terms to the Israeli government."" In a separate column in the Journal, Harris said Ireland had recognized a Palestinian state to move toward a two-state solution before that possibility was ""bombed to oblivion"".

2024/5/28,"Irish Government accused of ‘cooperating with terrorists’ by Israeli Foreign Minister The Irish Government has again been criticized by Israel's Foreign Minister for its decision to recognize the State of Palestine. The Irish Government has “chosen to cooperate with the Nukhba terrorists and bolster the terrorist monster” with its recognition of the State of Palestine, Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday, May 28. Foreign Minister Katz - who has been fierce in his criticism of Ireland since it announced it would be recognizing the State of Palestine - reiterated his criticism on Tuesday in a statement after meeting with the European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Olivér Várhelyi. ""I am pleased to know that we have a true friend like you in the European Union,” Katz said in a statement on Tuesday, addressing Várhelyi. “The State of Israel is at war for its future. “On October 7, the Hamas rapists and murderers sought to destroy us. “The world and the European Union must stand with us to return all the hostages and defeat Hamas. “The governments of Spain, Norway, and Ireland have chosen to cooperate with the Nukhba terrorists and bolster the terrorist monster - recognition of a Palestinian state constitutes the renunciation of our hostages."" Commissioner Várhelyi said: “I will continue to stand alongside you; you have a friend, we support Israel's right to self-defense and security. ""It is clear that I will not agree to a ceasefire without the unconditional release of the hostages. For me, it is impossible to let Hamas escape punishment. ""Hamas must not remain in Gaza.

The day after Ireland, Spain, and Norway announced they would be recognizing the State of Palestine, Foreign Minister Katz shared a shocking video on X that claimed ""Hamas thanks Ireland."" The video bizarrely features Irish dance and Irish music.

For 42 years, the families have had to organise and fund remembrance ceremonies . We thank the the government for this. https://t.co/0fZITYo0xs On April 18, the jury in the inquest into the tragedy ruled that the 48 people who died in the fire were unlawfully killed. The jury found that the thickness of the smoke, combined with the failure of the emergency lighting system and the lack of preparedness of the staff, made it more difficult for people to leave the nightclub. Emergency exits were also locked, chained, or otherwise impeded. The inquest was the longest-running in the history of the Irish State, lasting 122 days and hearing testimony from 373 witnesses. In the wake of the ruling on April 18, victims' families reiterated their call for a formal State apology. On April 23, Harris issued a State apology to the victims of the Stardust disaster. In the Dáil, in the presence of victims' relatives, he said in part: ""For all of this, as Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, I apologise unreservedly to all the families of the Stardust victims and all the survivors for the hurt that was done to them and for the profoundly painful years of struggle for the truth.""",0,1

Ireland’s Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has announced the expansion of the Free Contraception Scheme to include women aged 32-35. From July 1, women who are ordinarily resident in Ireland and aged from their 17th birthday until the day before their 36th birthday will be eligible for free contraception under the scheme, Ireland’s Department of Health announced on Monday, June 3. To ensure continuity of care, women who have had coils, IUDs, IUSs, or implants inserted while eligible for the scheme will remain eligible for follow-up care related to their devices after their 36th birthday, that is, subsequent checks and free removal of any devices. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The extension has been supported by an additional €4 million in funding through the Women’s Health Fund under the Women’s Health Action Plan 2024-2025, with a total of €48 million now allocated to the scheme for 2024. The scheme is open to women, girls, and other people identifying as transgender or non-binary, who are ordinarily resident in Ireland, and for whom prescription contraception is deemed suitable by their doctors. Almost 2,400 GPs and 2,050 pharmacies are providing services under the scheme, with more than 189,000 women accessing the service in 2023. Minister Donnelly said: ""Gender should not be a barrier to healthcare, and I firmly believe that the Free Contraception Scheme is a landmark initiative that empowers women, enabling them to make choices about their reproductive health without any financial burden. ""Demand for this service is evident, and we are responding to that demand by extending services to women aged 32 to 35 inclusive from July 1. We know that many women in this age group may be planning to start families, with 33 years being the average age of a first-time mother. ""However, it is important that we support all women in providing equitable access to services that allow them to control their reproductive health and avoid unintended pregnancies. ""Hormonal contraception is also used to treat the adverse symptoms of periods such as pain and heavy bleeding, so I’m pleased that the Free Contraception Scheme will now also provide this treatment for free to women aged 32-35. ""Amid continuing cost-of-living pressures, this scheme is a significant step forward in our efforts to provide a quality, equitable health service for all."" Ireland's free contraception scheme was introduced in September 2022 for those aged 17 to 25, expanded to include 26 to 30-year-olds last year, and expanded again in January to include women aged 31. The scheme covers the cost of consultations with GPs, family planning, student health and primary care centres, and prescriptions for the wide range of contraceptive options available on the Health Service Executive (HSE) Re-Imbursement List. These options include long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs), which include injections, implants, and hormonal and copper intra-uterine devices and systems (coils). The scheme also includes emergency contraception in addition to the oral contraceptive pill, patch and ring. LARC fittings, removals, injections and checks are also free of charge under the scheme. Prescriptions are dispensed at a local pharmacy of choice. If LARCs are chosen (coils and implants, for example), patients return to a service provider participating in the scheme to have the device fitted, and subsequently removed. All of these costs are fully covered by the State and are free of charge to the patient.

2024/6/4,"""We have to learn lessons"" - Irish Government moving closer to launching COVID inquiry Taoiseach Simon Harris said the terms of reference for a review of Ireland's response to COVID should be finalized in the coming weeks. Ireland's Taoiseach Simon Harris and Tánaiste Micheál Martin said it is the Government's intention to hold a review or evaluation of the country's response to COVID. “The Government has made it clear, the three parties in Government and our Programme for Government in terms of a review in relation to the pandemic, I think that’s a sensible thing to do,"" the Taoiseach said on Tuesday, according to RTE News. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The Taoiseach was speaking in the wake of a report from the Society of Actuaries in Ireland that found the country experienced about 1,100 excess deaths during the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021. The analysis reveals “broadly no excess mortality in 2020; however, 2021 witnessed an increase in excess mortality, signaling a more significant impact on mortality patterns during the pandemic's second year."" The report notes: ""Among various possible contributing factors to the lower excess death in 2020, government-imposed restrictions stand out as one potentially significant factor."" The Taoiseach said on Tuesday: ""I very much welcome the fact that today we're seeing some data being published from the Society of Actuaries that’s showing the benefit in terms of life-saving decisions that were made by the Irish Government, and, more importantly, by the people of Ireland in terms of their compliance public health advice, but it is the intention of Government to hold a review, and we expect to be in a position to finalize the terms of reference in the coming weeks."" The Tánaiste said: “I think there’s been a lot of work up in terms of evaluation of how the country did during COVID so that it will inform future responses in respect to say another pandemic or indeed another emergency. “I think we have to learn lessons, we have to have an objective look at how we did. “But a lot of work up has happened over the last number of months. I think it’s a matter of selecting people, someone to head up such an evaluation and take it from there.” The report published on Tuesday was authored by members of the Society’s Demography Committee and “examines the level of excess all-cause mortality experienced in Ireland during the Covid-19 pandemic, offering some insights beyond the tally of reported Covid-19 fatalities. Excess mortality is defined as the difference between observed deaths and expected deaths. The report focuses especially on the first two years of the pandemic - 2020 and 2021 - and examines the excess deaths ""as a metric in understanding the pandemic's impact.” The authors emphasized: “Whilst this report provides a numerical analysis of the deaths experienced in Ireland in 2020/2021, the Society is very much cognizant of the people behind these numbers and is mindful of those who suffered the loss of a loved one during this period.” The report pointed out that recent research on the impact of Covid-19 on mortality in Ireland has been contradictory and stressed: “It is important to note that there is not one definitive approach to calculating excess mortality – mainly because, whilst observed deaths will ultimately be a matter of record (i.e. they are objective), the calculation of expected deaths is dependent on the choice of methodology (i.e., it relies on professional judgement). ""This analysis is based on a methodology that relies on past experience as a benchmark for expected deaths. As presented in this report, different past periods for estimating expected deaths result in varying levels of excess mortality.” Earlier this year, research published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed that Ireland was one of nine OECD countries to avoid excess deaths during the core pandemic years of 2020-2022.",0,1

2024/6/4,"Ireland saw record high number of adults participating in sports in 2023 Nearly two million adults in Ireland participate in sport every week - more than ever before - according to the Irish Sport Monitor 2023 Report. Sports participation in Ireland has greatly increased in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the Irish Sport Monitor 2023 Report. The report, a long-established survey providing an ongoing measurement of sports participation in Ireland, stated that regular participation levels have jumped from a low of 40% at the peak of the pandemic in 2021 to 47% in 2023. Meanwhile, the gap in participation rates between men and women now stands below 3%, the narrowest it has ever been. This is largely due to women's participation levels rising by 6% between 2022 and 2023, with 46% of adult women now regularly participating in sports. A total of 49% of men participate in sports on a weekly basis, the report found. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The report further found that the difference in sports participation between socio-economic groups also reached its narrowest level since the pandemic. Although this difference is still significant at 19%, it is much lower than the 34% difference measured in 2017. Elsewhere, sports participation levels increased in 2023 among both younger and older age groups, with 64% (up from 60% in 2022) of those aged under 35 and 40% (from 35% in 2022) of those aged 35 and over playing sport regularly. Social participation figures in club membership, volunteering, and event attendance also increased in 2023, and although event attendance figures are the highest ever recorded, club membership and volunteering figures are still slightly behind pre-pandemic highs measured in 2019. Commenting on the report's findings, Minister of State for Sport, Physical Education, and the Gaeltacht Thomas Byrne said: ""I welcome the confirmation that nearly two million adults are participating in sport every week in Ireland, and I am determined to see these numbers continue to grow over the coming years.

Leo Varadkar, who resigned as Taoiseach of Ireland in March, has shared his “frank” thoughts on the possible re-election of Donald Trump. As Taoiseach, Varadkar met with President Trump a number of times both in Ireland and the US. Speaking with the Irish publication The Journal on Tuesday, June 4, Varadkar said he ""can be much more frank"" now that he is no longer Taoiseach. “I don’t think it’s a good thing for America or the world for President Trump to be re-elected,"" Varadkar, now a TD for Dublin West, told The Journal. Varadkar said his “biggest worry” is that Trump wouldn’t protect Ukraine and would potentially do a deal with Russia. He added: “I think if Ukraine didn’t have American support, Europe would struggle to step up to fill that gap. ""And if Ukraine falls under control of the Kremlin, we’re looking at more refugees, more inflation, and of course, 30 million people no longer being able to choose their government.""

He later admitted that while he had been considering resigning for a number of months, he made up his mind over St. Patrick's Day weekend in Washington, DC. Varadkar, as well as other Irish politicians who traveled to the US for St. Patrick's Day, faced considerable calls to boycott the annual visit due to Biden's stance on Israel and the war in Gaza. Varadkar said he thought it would be a ""big mistake"" to boycott the events, but did say that he would use the opportunity to to make clear how the Irish people feel about the situation in Gaza.

He continued: “But I think sometimes people in Ireland buy into this idea that Israel is just a tool of America and America can press the on switch and off switch. It’s much more complicated than that. ""And also, the reality is there can only be a ceasefire when both Hamas and Israeli government agree to it.

A statement from the Department of the Taoiseach said Dr. Abdalmajid thanked Harris and the Irish people and said that recognition, with Spain and Norway, was a source of strength, hope and light on a path to peace for the people of Palestine that put her country on a different level in the world’s perception. The Taoiseach said Ireland’s foreign policy was always guided by international law and human rights, and we saw the imperative for a two-state solution. He was clear in his condemnation of Hamas, its horrific attack on Israel, and ongoing holding of hostages. The Taoiseach and the Ambassador spoke about current efforts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages. The Taoiseach said the onus was now on all parties to stretch themselves and to engage, despite any internal pressures they face. The Ambassador briefed the Taoiseach on the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and the urgent need for food and aid to flow through the Rafah crossing in many multiples of the quantities currently passing through. The Taoiseach said recognition of Palestine was not the end of a process, but the beginning. He said Ireland would intensify work with Arab and European partners to support the Arab Peace Vision and concrete steps to implement the two-State solution. Immediate focus will remain on the urgent pursuit of a ceasefire in Gaza, the unconditional release of hostages, and full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and a rapid and sustainable scale up in humanitarian aid. Later on Thursday, Dr. Abdalmajid said that the meeting was an ""honor"" and that she and Harris discussed the ""dire situation in Occupied Palestine."" It is an honor to be welcomed for the first time in the Taoiseach’s office as the Ambassador of the State of Palestine. I briefed the Taoiseach @SimonHarrisTD on the dire situation in Occupied Palestine, the deteriorating humanitarian situation &the continued vicious aggression. https://t.co/3ipleDrkkw",0,1
2024/6/7,"Father of Irish-Israeli hostage Emily Hand says he's now ""ashamed"" to be Irish Dublin native Thomas Hand, whose daughter Emily was taken hostage by Hamas, has slammed Ireland for its recognition of the State of Palestine. Thomas Hand, whose Irish-Israeli daughter Emily Hand was released from Hamas captivity in November, said this week that he is ""ashamed"" to be Irish after the Irish Government formally recognized the State of Palestine. ""I've been a very proud Irishman all my life,"" Thomas Hand told Reuters this week, according to RTE News. ""I advertise the fact, I tell people, 'Yes, I'm Irish.' ""I'm not so proud anymore. I'm actually embarrassed, ashamed, to call myself Irish now."" Thomas admitted that the Irish Government was ""integral"" in securing the return of his daughter Emily in November. ""Okay, she's only an individual,"" Thomas told Reuters, ""but she was, is, an Irish citizen, and then knowing everything, knowing everything that Hamas has done, I'm sure they've seen the videos of their GoPros, they've seen all the evidence. ""Uh, okay, here is your reward then, for absolute violence. ""Here's your reward - we recognize you as a state. Nice one."" Thomas continued: ""I don't mind pro-Palestine, but when you're pro-Hamas, that's a different ballgame. You're supporting that? It's wrong."" Thomas said they're ""praying"" for the war to end, adding: ""All they (Hamas) have to do is hand over the hostages and the war is over.""

Thomas, a native of Dublin who lived in England before moving to Israel in 1992, was initially told that his daughter Emily, a dual Irish-Israeli citizen, was killed during the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel. He made headlines when he told CNN he felt it was a ""blessing"" that his daughter had been killed as opposed to being kidnapped by Hamas. However, later in October, Thomas was informed there was a ""high chance"" that Emily was, in fact, still alive and likely taken hostage. Along with the families of other hostages, Thomas traveled to both Ireland - where he met with Irish political leaders - and the US to drum up support for not only the release of his daughter but also the other hostages. On November 21, Qatar announced that successful joint meditation efforts involving Israel, Hamas, Egypt, and the US resulted in an agreement for a humanitarian pause as well as the release of hostages. Emily was part of the second group of hostages released on November 25, just days after her ninth birthday. In an interview with Piers Morgan in January, Thomas said his daughter is ""as tough as nails."" Discussing his daughter's treatment in captivity, Thomas admitted: “As far as terrorists go, they were reasonably good."" Thomas told Reuters this week that Emily is on track for a full recovery. On May 22, Ireland, along with Spain and Norway, announced that it would be formally recognizing the State of Palestine, which it did on May 28. The formal recognition of Palestine means that the Irish Government recognizes Palestine as a sovereign and independent state and opens diplomatic relations between Dublin and Ramallah. On the formal recognition, Taoiseach Simon Harris said: “This decision of Ireland is about keeping hope alive. ""It is about believing that a two-state solution is the only way for Israel and Palestine to live side by side in peace and security.""",0,1

2024/7/1,"""Historic"" legislation provides legal framework for surrogacy in Ireland Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly described the legislation as ""critical, historic, and ground-breaking"". Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has announced that a historic piece of legislation providing a legal framework for surrogacy in Ireland has passed both Houses of the Oireachtas. Donnelly said the far-reaching Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill 2022 will encompass regulation for a wide range of practices, including gamete and embryo donation for assisted human reproduction (AHR). It also covers domestic altruistic surrogacy; pre-implantation genetic testing of embryos; posthumous-assisted human reproduction; and embryo and stem cell research. The law has been in the making for around 20 years and will regulate domestic and international surrogacy as well as licensing fertility clinics and treatment. Ireland had been one of two EU member states not to have a regulatory system in place. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The legislation, described as ""critical"" by Donnelly, covers fertility treatments for couples as well as single people living in Ireland. The legislation will also provide that any person providing AHR treatment within the State must hold a license granted by the Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority (AHRRA), a body to be established by this Act. Donnelly acknowledged that AHR is a ""complex, innovative, and fast-moving area of medicine"" and said the issues covered by the bill have been subject to much discussion, including by the Special Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy. ""I have listened to individuals, to families, and to experts in this field and I know that this legislation means so much to so many,"" Donnelly said in a statement. ""This is a critical, historic, and ground-breaking piece of legislation. It will introduce, for the first time in this country, a regulatory framework for assisted human reproduction. ""This legislation will support people who wish to have children through AHR. It will clarify the legal position of those children and provide an ethical framework for research and new reproductive technologies. ""One of the most important features of the Bill is to allow for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR, the Assisted Human Reproduction Regulatory Authority. The new rules, regulations, and provisions of this legislation will provide clarity and peace of mind."" The Bill will now be referred to President Michael D. Higgins for signature and enacted into law as soon as possible. Fine Gael Senator Mary Seery Kearney, welcomed passage of the legislation and said it would provide legal recognition of parent-child relationships. ""Many children have been born in the interim via surrogacy and have been in the precarious position that only their biological fathers are their recognized parents in Irish law. Their mothers, or in the case of same-sex male couples, second fathers, have no standing other than guardianship. This means that on a child’s 18th birthday, they become legal strangers to their parents.""",0,1

TD Simon Coveney announced today, July 10, that he will be stepping out of politics at Ireland's next general election, which is set to happen no later than next March. Coveney, 52, has been a TD for Cork South-Central since 1998. He previously served as Ireland's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence, Tánaiste, Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, as well as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. He had previously announced in April that he told Fine Gael party colleague Simon Harris, who was at that point the Taoiseach-in-waiting in the wake of Leo Varadkar's surprise resignation, that he would ""not be making myself available to serve in Cabinet when the Dáil resumes next week."" Coveney said at the time that he would continue to work as a TD for Cork South Central, but acknowledged that the Fine Gael party needs renewal. On Wednesday, Coveney announced that he would be stepping out of politics at the next election. As per Irish law, the same Dáil shall not continue for longer than five years from the date of its first meeting. As such, the current 33rd Dáil must be dissolved by the President of Ireland at the request of the Taoiseach no later than February 19, 2025, and a general election must be called by March 22, 2025.

I've had opportunities in politics that I could never have dreamt possible before 1998; as a councillor, a TD, a Minister, and as Tánaiste."" He said his career, which has taken him to ""every corner of the world,"" was only possible ""because of the trust and generosity of the people of Cork South Central to whom I'll be forever grateful."" He continued: ""I wouldn't be leaving if I didn't believe the future was bright. Right across the country we saw new candidates emerge in the recent local elections.

Some 300 bonfires are expected to be lit across Northern Ireland tonight, July 11, in advance of the 12th of July holiday that is observed annually by loyalists. Ahead of the lighting of the pyres, however, two bonfires staged headline-grabbing stunts, though for very different reasons. On July 9, Stephen Maginnis made history for what he claims is the world's first base jump from a bonfire. He shared a video of his jump from the Craigyhill bonfire in Larne, Co Antrim on social media on Tuesday: The jump was organized to benefit Skye Carson, a one-year-old who is due to begin chemotherapy this week, and in memory of Scarlett Rossborough, an eight-year-old from Larne who was killed in a car accident last year. At the time of publication on Thursday, the GoFundMe had raised £2,892 of its £3,000 target. After the jump, the organizers of the Craigyhill bonfire said Maginnis ""is a professional base jumper, not some egite with a parachute."" They added: ""We decided to let Stephen do this to draw attention to this worthy cause and hopefully get the funds needed to help wee Skye and to help the children’s hospice in aid of young Scarlet.""

This comes a year after the Moygashel bonfire featured Ireland's then-Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the Irish tricolor, and a sign saying ""Good Friday Agreement? ... That ship has sailed."" The Moygashel Bonfire Association said in a statement on social media on Wednesday: ""A mockup police car occupied by Jeffrey Donaldson and Gerry Kelly was placed on top of Moygashel bonfire this year as a political statement to highlight the strong opposition currently felt among loyalists towards the union dismantling 'Donaldson Deal'. ""Jeffrey and those who aided and abetted him by deploying lies and deceit to force the 'surrender deal' upon unionism should hang their heads in shame. Grassroots Loyalism and Unionism will never forget this betrayal and shall continue the fight in opposition to the Irish sea border. ""What better way to grab headlines and spread such a message than through the use of a police vehicle. ""Alternatively an image of Gerry 'bomber' Kelly riding shotgun serves as a stark reminder that unapologetic republican murderers lurk at the heart of our government and security services where they hold a gun to the head of our so called peace process. The outcome is a two-tier justice system by means of continued Loyalist legacy inquests and the persecution of our veterans whilst republicans enjoy the protection of comfort letters and the benefits of an active republican appeasement policy.""

Ireland's economic output increased significantly in 2023, according to new data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO). Gross National Income (GNI), a measure of Ireland’s economic performance that excludes multinational companies, expanded by 5% in 2023, the CSO said in a statement. However, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 5.5% in the same period due to reduced goods exports by multinational companies. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Most countries use GDP as an indicator of economic performance, but Ireland's GDP is badly distorted by the significant presence of multinational companies. GNI, which has been used to measure Ireland's economic activity since 2017, provides a more accurate picture of Ireland's economic performance. GNI is calculated by measuring the total income earned by residents of a country living at home and abroad and subtracting income earned in the domestic economy by non-residents. It also includes adding subsidies received from abroad and subtracting subtracting subsidies paid to foreign countries. Chris Sibley, Assistant General Director of the CSO, noted that the more globalized sectors of the economy contracted for the first time since 2013. ""Overall, the multinational sector contraction was 16.2%, ""Sibley said in a statement. The globalized industry sector contracted by 21.7% in 2023, while the information and technology sector grew by 7.4%. There was also an increase of 6.1% for sectors focused on the domestic market, including a growth of 14.8% for the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector. The Financial and insurance sector expanded by 14.1%, while real estate activities grew by 10.9%. However, the construction sector fell by 2.9% in 2023, while the distribution, transportation, hotels, and restaurants sector posted a decline of 1%. Meanwhile, personal spending on goods and services increased by 4.8% in 2023, while Government spending on goods and services increased by 4.3%. ""Today’s results include estimates for GNI, the indicator designed to exclude globalization effects disproportionately impacting Irish economic results,"" Sibley said. Ireland's GNP for 2023 was €290.9 billion, while Ireland's GDP was €510 billion, marking the second year in a row that Ireland's GDP exceeded half a trillion euros. GDP had grown by 9.4% in 2022 and 13.6% in 2021. Minister for Finance Jack Chambers said the figures reflected strong growth in the domestic economy. ""Despite facing significant inflationary pressures, consumer spending nevertheless drove growth in the domestic economy,"" Chambers said. ""This performance reflects the strength of the labor market, which has been at full employment since mid-2022.""

2024/7/14,"Taoiseach describes Trump shooting as ""heinous"" act of political violence Trump was shot in the ear during a campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania on Saturday evening but is ""doing well,"" according to his campaign. Taoiseach Simon Harris has described the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump as a ""heinous"" act of political violence. Trump was shot in the ear during a campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania on Saturday evening but is ""doing well,"" according to his campaign. The former president appeared to have suffered no major injuries besides the wound to his upper right ear during the attack. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Trump was almost immediately swarmed and covered up by his security agents after the shooting began and later emerged from the scrum with his fist raised and blood streaking down his face. One person who attended the rally has been killed, while two others were critically injured, the Secret Service said. The FBI has identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania as the shooter. Crooks, who was shot dead by the Secret Service, opened fire from the roof of a building around 140 meters from where Trump was speaking. An AR15-style semiautomatic rifle was recovered near his body. Reuters reports that Crooks was a registered Republican, citing state voting records. Speaking on the Sunday Politics Show on BBC Northern Ireland, Harris condemned the incident and said he is relieved that Trump is secure and well. ""Political violence must always be condemned and always be called out, and I must say it is quite alarming the rise that we're seeing in political violence across the world. It's only weeks since my Slovakian counterpart [Robert Fico] had an attempt on his life as well,"" Harris said. Harris said the fact that Trump had spoken to President Joe Biden by telephone following the shooting despite being political rivals provided a ""glimmer of hope"". ""It's so important that political violence is condemned and, and of course I want to send former President Trump our very best wishes and his family and all of those caught up in this horrific heinous political act last night."" Speaking on @BBCnireland this morning and asked about the assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump. I condemn this heinous crime.

""It is so important and that we work out a way of engaging and robustly debating issues without dehumanizing people."" Biden said he is ""grateful"" that Trump is doing well, adding that there was ""no place"" for political violence in the United States. ""I’m praying for him and his family and for all those who were at the rally, as we await further information,"" Biden said on Saturday night. ""Jill and I are grateful to the Secret Service for getting him to safety. There’s no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it.""",0,1
2024/7/16,"Irish politician denied Communion over support for abortion Colm Burke said he was ""taken aback"". Priest told him he had been ""excommunicated"" over his ""support for abortion"". A Fine Gael politician, Colm Burke, has revealed that he was refused Communion at a recent funeral due to his support for the abortion referendum in 2018. Colm Burke, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, said he was ""taken aback"" when he was denied Communion by Fr. Gabriel Burke during the funeral of a long-time friend at St. Patrick's Church, Whitechurch, in the parish of Blarney. Burke revealed that the priest told him he had been ""excommunicated"" over his ""support for abortion"". Explaining his decision, Fr. Gabriel Burke said he was acting per a statement from Archbishop Eamon Martin, in 2013. Speaking in August 2013 after the Dáil passed the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which allowed abortion when the mother's life was in danger, Martin said politicians who supported the act would be excommunicated or denied Communion. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Ireland subsequently legalized abortions following a landslide vote to repeal the 8th Amendment in 2018. ""Colm Burke voted for abortion and he knows the teaching of the [Catholic] Church that any politician who voted [for] abortion cannot receive communion — Archbishop Eamon Martin made that very clear before the vote on abortion in 2013,"" Fr. Gabriel Burke said. ""Archbishop Martin said that any politician that voted for abortion in Dáil Éireann was ‘co-operating with evil’ and should not present for Communion and Colm Burke knew that because he was here twice before, and he’s been refused Communion on both those occasions."" Crowds at Dublin Castle following a ""Yes"" vote for 2018 abortion referendum. Colm Burke said he has been a mass-goer all his life and said he was ""very taken aback"" by the incident. ""I thought it (the priest’s stance) wasn’t the way to deal with it,"" Burke told the Irish Examiner. “The incident that occurred must not deflect from the purpose of the funeral mass to support the family of the person who has died, to celebrate that person’s achievements and the valuable contribution he made to both his immediate family and the wider community of Whitechurch throughout his life."" The Association of Catholic Priests ""unambiguously condemned"" Fr. Burke for refusing to give Communion, stating that it is ""not the role of the priest to judge the conscience of another person"". ""Like every member of the Catholic Church, public representatives must act in accordance with their conscience,"" the Association said in a statement. ""The priest does not own the Eucharist and would do well to ponder the statement of Pope Francis that he has never refused the Eucharist to anyone."" In 2021, Pope Francis said that denying Communion to people who support abortion must be handled in a pastoral manner and not by public condemnations that seek to ""excommunicate"" Catholics. ""If we look at the history of the church, we can see that every time the bishops did not act like shepherds when dealing with a problem, they aligned themselves with political life, on political problems,"" Pope Francis said in September 2021.",0,1
2024/7/16,"Ireland launches new Irish language network for public sector employees Gréasán Gaeilge na hEarnála Poiblí is a new Irish language network for public service personnel who wish to connect with other Irish speakers. Gréasán Gaeilge na hEarnála Poiblí, the Public Sector - Irish Language Network , aims to bring together public sector employees interested in learning and developing their Irish language skills. The new Irish language network was launched by Ireland's Minister of State for the Gaeltacht, Sport and Physical Education, Thomas Byrne T.D., at Farleigh House in Phoenix Park, Dublin on July 11. A post shared by Gréasán Gaeilge na hEarnála Poiblí (@greasangaeilge) Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Ireland's Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media said that given the increase seen in the number of people undertaking Irish language training courses in the public sector in recent times, the launch and establishment of this network is closely aligned with the wishes of those participants for increased language acquisition opportunities outside the classroom. The network gives a formal basis to the creation of Irish language-speaking opportunities for those in the public sector who wish to develop, maintain, or use their Irish in the context of work - from learners up to advanced competence and everything in between. This network welcomes civil servants, public sector employees in general, professional/technical grades such as doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, legal advisers, and other roles such as Gardaí Síochána, bus drivers, and others. A post shared by Gréasán Gaeilge na hEarnála Poiblí (@greasangaeilge) Speaking at the launch, Minister of State Byrne said: ""First off, I would like to congratulate Oireachtas na Gaeilge for their commitment to the State's vision in strengthening the language in the public system and for all the hard work they have done since the end of last year towards launching this network. ""The main message I want to convey here tonight is that this is a welcoming, inclusive and diverse network. Whatever your level of competence, from basic level up to advanced, you are welcome to register with the network so that you can use, develop and sustain that level of competence. ""This network is a central element in the Government's efforts to increase support for learners and speakers of Irish across the public sector in the coming years - especially in the context of our work under the Official Languages Acts 2003-2021 and increasing the number of people with Irish language competence in the system.

2024/7/17,"Northern Ireland Legacy Act to be repealed and replaced The British government is poised to repeal the conditional immunity scheme of the Northern Ireland Legacy Act and strengthen the ICRIR. The controversial Northern Ireland Legacy Act will be repealed and replaced, King Charles III said today, Wednesday, July 17. “My Government will continue to support the political institutions and devolved government in Northern Ireland,” Charles said in his King's Speech, written by the government, before both houses of British Parliament today. “In consultation with all parties, measures will be brought forward to begin the process of repealing and replacing the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 [Northern Ireland Legacy Legislation].” Background notes for the King's Speech from the Prime Minister's Office elaborate: ""We cannot repeal the Act in its entirety without anything to replace it. ""The Northern Ireland High Court has found the Independent Commission forReconciliation and Information Recovery to be independent and capable ofconducting human rights compliant investigations, but the Government willexplore options to strengthen its independence. ""We will repeal the conditional immunity scheme, which has been found by the Northern Ireland High Court to be incompatible with the UK's obligations under the ECHR. ""Following consultation with all parties, we will reverse the policy prohibiting victims and families from bringing civil claims. And we will set out steps to allow the Troubles-era inquests that were prematurely halted to resume."" Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! The controversial Northern Ireland Legacy Act, introduced in 2022, has the rare distinction of being opposed by all of Northern Ireland’s major political parties. It is also opposed by victims and victims groups, the Irish government, US politicians, Irish American groups, UN experts, and the majority of the UK public. The day after it became law last September, Amnesty International UK said victims had joined together and submitted legal challenges to the Belfast High Court. The Court ruled in February that the legislation's immunity provisions are incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). However, it also ruled that the Act's Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) is capable of being compliant. The UK government moved to appeal the Belfast High Court's decision in March. The following month, the UN's Human Rights Committee said the Act should be repealed or reformed to guarantee ""independence, transparency, and genuine investigation power."" Meanwhile, the Irish Government announced in December that it was initiating an inter-State case against the UK under the European Convention on Human Rights. The move was slammed by the UK Government, with Northern Ireland's then-Secretary of State labeling it as ""unnecessary"" and ""misguided."" The intention to repeal and replace the Legacy Act was included in the UK Labour Party's manifesto, which was released ahead of the UK's July 4 general election. The manifesto said in part: ""The Legacy Act denies justice to the families and victims of the Troubles. Labour will repeal and replace it, by returning to the principles of the Stormont House Agreement, and seeking support from all communities in Northern Ireland."" In what has been described as a ""landslide"" victory over Conservatives, who had been in power for more than a decade, the Labour Party emerged as the biggest party in the UK, and its leader Keir Starmer has now become Prime Minister. Last October, Starmer said that if he became Prime Minister, he would move to repeal the legislation. The announcement that the Legacy Act will be repealed and replaced comes two days after US Congressman Brendan Boyle and 21 members of US Congress wrote to Starmer ""to voice our strong support that your government remains committed to swiftly repealing and replacing the Legacy Act."" Responding to the announcement on Wednesday, Tánaiste Micheál Martin said: “It is very welcome that the new British Government is following through on their election manifesto commitment to repeal and replace the Legacy Act. “I have always been clear that this Act, as it stands, is not fit for purpose. “I discussed this issue with the new Secretary of State, Hilary Benn, last week, and I look forward to working with him as he takes this forward in thes ahead. ""The needs of victims and full compliance with the ECHR must be at the heart of this revised approach.” I discussed this issue with the new Secretary of State, @hilarybennmp, last week, and I look forward to working with him as he takes this forward in the months ahead.

Ireland's Tánaiste Micheál Martin responded to the advisory opinion delivered by the International Court of Justice on Friday, July 19 in respect of the Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. In its opinion, the Court reaffirmed that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the régime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law.

2024/7/25,"WATCH: Israeli Prime Minister thanks ""proud Irish American Zionist"" Joe Biden Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referred to US President Joe Biden as an ""Irish American Zionist"" twice during his controversial US visit. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has referenced US President Joe Biden's Irish American roots twice while in the US this week. “President Biden and I have known each other for over 40 years,"" Netanyahu said in his address on Wednesday before a special joint meeting of US Congress. “I want to thank him for half a century of friendship with Israel and for being, as he says, ‘a proud Zionist.’ “Actually, he says, ‘a proud Irish American Zionist.’” These remarks were met with applause. Netanyahu, who an International Criminal Court prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant for in relation to ""war crimes"" in Palestine, was invited to address US Congress by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries on May 31. According to Politico earlier on Wednesday, more than 50 members of Congress had publicly indicated plans to boycott or not attend Netanyahu's address. Meanwhile, thousands of protesters converged on Washington on Wednesday to condemn the Israeli Prime Minister's visit, the Associated Press reported. On Thursday, Netanyahu, addressing the press next to Biden in The White House, repeated his ""Irish American Zionist"" description of the President. ""From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin @Netanyahu: ""From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel."" pic.twitter.com/8kDq9D3D4F Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Indeed, Biden regularly touts his Irish American roots and has publicly referred to himself as a Zionist on multiple occasions, but it is unclear if he has publicly referred to himself as a “proud Irish American Zionist.” During an interview with Complex's Speedy Morman on July 12, Biden was asked why his and the United States' support for Israel is so strong. The President replied: ""If there weren't an Israel, every Jew in the world would be at risk. And so, there's a need for it to be strong and a need for Israel to have, after World War II, the ability for Jews to have a place that was their own. ""You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist. And a Zionist is about whether or not Israel is a safe haven for Jews because of their history of how they've been persecuted."" In the same interview, Biden defended providing weapons to Israel, stating that he approved ""defensive weapons, I denied them offensive weapons."" He added: ""I made it real clear, they cannot use weapons that we provide to use in civilian areas."" According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, as of July 22, at least 39,006 Palestinians have been reportedly killed and another 89,818 Palestinians have been reportedly injured in the Gaza Strip since October 7. Biden's equal embrace of his Irish roots and Zionism has drawn considerable criticism in Ireland in recent months. In November, a mural of Biden in Co Mayo was sprayed with 'Genocide Joe' graffiti. An open letter urging Irish citizens to revoke their symbolic support of Biden has drawn more than 20,000 signatures since December. Ahead of St. Patrick's Day this year, there were widespread calls for Irish politicians to boycott the annual engagements at the White House. Last month, a petition was launched to take down the mural of Biden in Co Mayo. In perhaps the most stark difference between Ireland and the US, Ireland formally recognized the State of Palestine in May. Including Ireland, 145 out of the 193 UN member states have now recognized a Palestinian state - the US is not among them. After Ireland's formal recognition, questions arose about the implications it might have on the relationship between Ireland and the US. While some Irish people are critical of Biden, Israeli officials have been, in turn, critical of Ireland. The Israeli Foreign Minister has launched fierce, sometimes bizarre, criticisms of Ireland, and has accused Ireland of 'bolstering the terrorist monster' by recognizing Palestine. Netanyahu delivered his address in Congress on Wednesday afternoon just a few days after Biden announced he was standing down from the 2024 Presidential election. Biden's Vice President Kamala Harris, who has now become the presumptive Democratic nominee for this year's presidential election, did not attend Netanyahu's address on Wednesday as she was in Indianapolis for a pre-scheduled event. With Harris becoming the presumptive nominee, questions surrounding her position on Israel have begun to arise. Harris, whose husband Douglas Emhoff is Jewish, has aligned with Biden's supportive stance on Israel but did emerge as the first member of the Biden administration to publicly call for a ceasefire. She said in March: ""Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table."" What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating, and our common humanity compels us to act. Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks. pic.twitter.com/mst8N9HxKa Later, in May, just three days after Ireland formally recognized Palestine, Biden unveiled what he called ""a roadmap to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages."" Taoiseach Simon Harris afterward urged Israel and Hamas to accept the plan. Biden and Harris were each due to meet with Netanyahu separately on Thursday. On Wednesday, ahead of the meetings, a senior administration official at the White House said: ""...I think the message [Biden and Harris] are sending to the Prime Minister tomorrow is that we’re completely aligned; it’s time to do all we can to close the hostage deal, get the hostages home. ""And also, we as an administration will continue to do all we possibly can to continue to support Israel’s self-defense against Iran, Hezbollah, all the threats ... and the Houthis and everything else. "" The official added: ""Between the President and Vice President, the Israelis will hear full alignment."" The White House Press Secretary said Biden and Netanyahu will ""discuss developments in Gaza and progress towards a ceasefire and hostage release deal and the United States’ ironclad commitment to Israel’s security, including countering Iran’s threats to Israel and the broader region."" Meanwhile, an aide told the Wall Street Journal that Harris is expected to tell Netanyahu “it is time for the war to end in a way where Israel is secure, all hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can enjoy their right to dignity, freedom, and self-determination.”",0,1
2024/7/31,"Ireland's ""new age of rail"" could see hourly services between key cities The final report of Ireland's All-Island Strategic Rail Review recommends an increase in intercity service frequencies to at least hourly. The Department of Transport in Ireland and the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) in Northern Ireland published the Final Report of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review, developed in the context of the “New Decade, New Approach” agreement, on Wednesday, July 31. Ireland's Department of Transport notes that the Report sets out 32 strategic recommendations to enhance and expand the rail system in Ireland and Northern Ireland up to 2050, aligning with net carbon zero commitments in both jurisdictions. The recommendations seek to transform the quality of the rail system to the benefit of passengers and wider society on the island, through additional track capacity, electrification, increased speeds, and higher service frequencies. Furthermore, the vision involves the construction of new rail lines, particularly in the North Midlands and North West, widening accessibility and connectivity. The All-Island Strategic Rail Review was first announced in 2021. ? The Final Report of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review has been published ?

Related to the goals of the Review, the recommendations in the Report by theme include the following: Artistic interpretation of the recommendations in the Report published on July 31. (Ireland's Department of Transport) The final Report published on Wednesday has taken account of responses received to a draft Report and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) published for public consultation last year. The recommendations for rail in the Report have been developed through an evidenced-based review taking into account goals such as connectivity, sustainability, and economic feasibility. As part of an evidence-based approach, a high-level economic appraisal was carried out to help ensure that the Review’s recommendations represent value-for-money. The Report estimates that the capital cost of implementing all of the recommendations by 2050 is in the order of €35bn-€37 billion/£29-£31 billion in 2023 prices, and that the monetised benefits to society from such investment would cover the costs, meeting the goal of economic feasibility. A more detailed evaluation would be conducted on individual projects brought forward for consideration. Ireland's Minister for Transport, Ireland, Eamon Ryan, said on Wednesday that the Report offers ""the most ambitious vision for rail in a century, bringing us forward to a new age of rail."" Northern Ireland's DfI Minister, John O’Dowd, stated: “This publication brings us to a new chapter where we can shape a better future for everyone by decarbonising key services and investing in climate adaptation measures, while at the same time supporting economic productivity through projects, policy and legislation. ""Getting infrastructure right, and investing in it accordingly, can create the foundations for better rural and urban communities.” O'Dowd noted that the Report has been ""an excellent example of joint collaboration on cross-border priorities, and this continued partnership will be key to realising its ambitions."" Ireland's Department of Transport added that in the coming months, rail services on the island are to be developed towards the Report’s vision. This includes an increase to an hourly train service between Dublin and Belfast, and additional services between Dublin and Galway, while procurement has also started on a new, faster, more sustainable “Enterprise” train fleet for the Dublin-Belfast route. Moreover, assisted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) Advisory Services, the Department of Transport and DfI, and agencies north and south, are working to progress the Report’s recommendations in the years ahead, maintaining momentum. This includes a more detailed identification of rail priorities to pursue over the next decade. Progress in following up on the Rail Review will be reported on as appropriate through the North South Ministerial Council.",0,1

2024/8/15,"Ireland’s former Taoiseach comes out swinging in support of Olympian boxer Leo Varadkar says he would be happy to make a donation to Olympic Gold medal-winning boxer Imane Khelif's cyber harassment lawsuit. Leo Varadkar, the former Taoiseach of Ireland and current Fine Gael TD for Dublin West, issued an emphatic message of support for boxer Imane Khelif after her sex came under scrutiny during the Paris Olympics. Khelif, who ultimately won Gold in the Women's Welterweight event, has launched a lawsuit in Paris after she was accused of being subject to what her lawyer called a “misogynist, racist and sexist campaign” during her Olympic run. “Fair play to Imane Khelif,” Varadkar said on Instagram on Wednesday, August 14, sharing a screenshot of a post on X that said JK Rowling and Elon Musk had been named in Khelif's lawsuit. “I hope she has financial support for her law suit. I’d be happy to make a donation,"" the former Taoiseach said. “She was born a girl, almost certainly assigned that gender by the doctor or midwife based on her physical characteristics. She was raised as a woman by her family and is accepted as such by her community. ""Even if she wanted to identify as a transman or intersex (which she doesn’t) that’s not an option for her in a conservative, religious, traditional country like Algeria. “This is the World they want us all to live in and still they attacked her. “Bunch of bullies looking for a soft target.” Varadkar, who announced that he was resigning as Taoiseach back in March, publicly confirmed in 2015 that he is gay. He has been in a relationship with his partner Dr. Matthew Barrett for a number of years. A post shared by Leo Varadkar (@leovaradkar) Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! In her first bout at the Olympics, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif's opponent Angela Carini, from Italy, pulled out less than a minute into their fight, later claiming she had ""never been hit with such a powerful punch.” The Italian boxer said her exit wasn't premeditated and that all the ""controversy"" made her ""sad."" “I’m sorry for my opponent, too,"" Carini said, according to the Associated Press. ""If the IOC said she can fight, I respect that decision.” The incident fueled a social media firestorm about Khelif's sex, with many calling her a man and or transgender. The speculation was intensified by the fact that Khelif and another boxer had been disqualified from the International Boxing Association's (IBA's) Women’s World Boxing Championships in 2023 after ""results from two independent laboratories in two different countries ... indicate that the athletes do not meet one of the eligibility criteria to continue competing at the Championships."" This IBA disqualification came after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) suspended its recognition of the IBA (then the AIBA) in 2019, and later decided in 2022 that the boxing qualifying events and competitions at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 would not be run under the authority of the IBA. It also came after Khelif competed in women's competitions throughout her career, including at the 2020 / 2021 Tokyo Olympics where she lost to Ireland's Kellie Harrington in the lightweight quarterfinals. Responding to the speculation surrounding Khelif, the IOC said on August 1: ""The current aggression against these two athletes is based entirely on this arbitrary decision, which was taken without any proper procedure – especially considering that these athletes had been competing in top-level competition for many years."" The IOC added that it was ""saddened by the abuse that the two athletes are currently receiving."" The following day, Mark Adams, spokesman for the IOC, further said: ""The Algerian boxer was born female, was registered female, lived her life as a female, boxed as a female, has a female passport. ""This is not a transgender case. ""I know you're not saying that, but there has been some confusion that somehow it's a man fighting a woman. This is just not the case scientifically. On that there is consensus. ""Scientifically, this is not a man fighting a woman."" The Paris Prosecutor’s Office (National Center for the Fight Against Online Hatred) has now confirmed to US outlet Variety that it received the complaint filed by Khelif and announced that an investigation had been launched. The Prosecutor's Office, Variety reported, said the investigation would be into counts of ""cyber harassment due to gender, public insult because of gender, public incitement to discrimination and public insult because of origin.” The lawsuit was filed against social media platform X and names its owner Elon Musk, as well as author JK Rowling, in it. Khelif's lawyer told Variety that Donald Trump would also be part of the investigation. “Trump tweeted, so whether or not he is named in our lawsuit, he will inevitably be looked into as part of the prosecution.”",0,1

The Taoiseach responded following reports that Gaza's Health Ministry said on Thursday that the death toll from Israel's war on Gaza had reached 40,005. The Associated Press added on Thursday: ""Israel’s offensive has also wounded 92,401 people and displaced over 85% of the population from their homes, the ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said. It does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its toll."" Citing an official update on Thursday from Gaza's Health Ministry, Al Jazeera reported that of the 40,005 people killed, 33% were children, 18.4% were women, and 8.6% were elderly people. Volker Türk, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said on Thursday: ""This unimaginable situation is overwhelmingly due to recurring failures by the Israeli Defense Forces to comply with the rules of war."" The updated death toll was announced as a new round of ceasefire talks began in Doha. According to NPR, Qatari, Egyptian, and American mediators are expected to be present. Israel has agreed to participate in the talks, but Hamas spokesman Suhail al-Hindi told NPR the group will not take part in them. The talks are based on the three-pronged plan US President Joe Biden put forth in May. Taoiseach Simon Harris called on all parties to give the plan ""positive consideration,"" describing it as ""an opportunity that should not be missed."" The Taoiseach's statement on Thursday reiterates points he made on Sunday, August 11 as the death toll in Gaza neared 40,000. ""There is growing evidence of a prolonged humanitarian catastrophe, and I am particularly disturbed by the confirmation this weekend by the United Nations that the number of aid deliveries reaching Gaza has halved, from a daily average of 169 trucks in April to fewer than 80 trucks a day in June and July,"" the Taoiseach said on Sunday. ""The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also says that only 24 of 67 planned aid missions to northern Gaza this month have been facilitated by Israel. ""The United Nations has also assessed that more than 80 percent of the Gaza Strip has been placed under evacuation orders since October of last year. ""When people are told to leave, they have nowhere to go, so they often go to schools. ""490 of Gaza’s schools have been bombed or damaged since the start of the war, and this weekend’s images from inside al-Taba’een school are gut-wrenching. Ireland condemns outright such awful and wholesale loss of civilian life. ""A ceasefire remains urgently needed, and all sides must immediately work in good faith to bring one about. ""We have all been horrified by the many undoubted war crimes that have been committed in Gaza. There can be no impunity. Those responsible must be held to account. ""All the legally binding orders of the ICJ must also be implemented in full. ""Too many innocent lives have been lost in 10 months. ""The world is standing at the precipice of a horrific moment, and yet all levers to bring an end to the violence are not being used. ""I again call for an urgent review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. The Agreement contains human rights clauses, and I do not believe it is conscionable for the EU to continue to render them redundant. ""Ireland calls for an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of Israeli hostages, and for aid trucks to flow unimpeded.""",0,1
2024/8/2,"Irish expert details fears as new poll reveals alarming increase in conspiracy theorists A senior analyst has expressed deep concern at a shocking new poll that has found one in five Irish people believe in conspiracy theories. The survey by election watchdog the Electoral Commission revealed a high prevalence of anti-immigration conspiracy theorist views among voters, including the lie that the establishment was ""replacing Irish people with more obedient immigrants"". One expert has said that there has been an increase in ""support for conspiratorial"" views since the pandemic, with the most prominent conspiracy theories in Ireland having migration ""at their core"" since then. Ciarán O’Connor, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which aims to tackle the spread of disinformation, said that social media platforms had been allowed to ""run wild online’ to keep audiences on their platform, by pushing people ""down a rabbit hole"". The Electoral Commission’s research was carried out in two parts by polling firm Red C, with over 3,000 people who voted in the local and European elections in June in an online poll, as well as during face-to-face interviews with 900 people who voted in the Limerick mayoral election. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! It found that more than a fifth of the electorate expressed belief in a series of conspiracy theories, including that ""elected officials want more immigration to bring in obedient voters who will vote for them"" and ‘the establishment is replacing white Irish people with non-white immigrants’ – both supported by 22% of voters. The survey also found that 28% of people believe that ""groups of scientists manipulate, fabricate or suppress evidence in order to deceive the public"". Mr O’Connor said that the study shows support for ""the great replacement theory"" which has been espoused by the perpetrators of several mass shootings. He said: ""It [the great replacement theory] has a very notable past, it was the main conspiracy theory behind the mosque shootings in Christchurch (in New Zealand) in 2019 and it inspired other terrorist attacks."" The conspiracy states that there is a deliberate effort to replace native-born populations in Western countries with immigrants to achieve political or cultural changes. Mr O’Connor said that people who are drawn to conspiracy theories have a psychological need that isn’t being met, such as uncertainty in a time of crisis. The pandemic is the best example of that, what happened then was a lot of people became exposed and more receptive to conspiracy theories in general. It started with Covid and moved on to other topics now,"" he said. While social media firms have rules around content that could lead to incitement to hatred, Mr O’Connor said there is a major ""enforcement gap"". ""The big social media platforms have detailed content moderation guidelines around incitement to hatred, but what we see so often in our research is these policies are not always implemented,"" he said. He said that the worrying aspect of the growing acceptance of the conspiracy theory is the link with violent attacks on minorities. ""The concerning thing is that when that content described migrants as invaders or puts targets on their backs can be linked to violence,"" he said. Irish police confront protesters at a scene in north Dublin city where petrol bombs were thrown at an anti-migrant protest in early July 2024. The survey showed that voters for the newly established Independent Ireland (II) party, set up by Independent TDs Michael Collins, and Michael Fitzmaurice, were most likely to believe the conspiracy theories at 47%. This was followed by Aontú voters (35%), Independent candidate voters (32%), Sinn Féin voters (27%), Fianna Fail voters (17%), Fine Gael voters (13%), Labour voters (10%), Green Party voters (9%), People Before Profit voters (7%) and Social Democrats voters (6%). Fianna Fáil’s Senator Timmy Dooley told the Irish Daily Mail that some TDs were fuelling conspiracy theories in their Dáil contributions. ""Some actors in the Dáil who give voice to it – people will say 'X or Y are saying',"" he said. Mr Dooley said that Oireachtas members have a responsibility to tell the truth and question things they know are untrue. Sinn Féin communications spokesman Martin Kenny told us that he has been ""surprised"" at the level of increase in conspiracy theories. ""That’s the change that has happened in the past 12 to 18 months, serious people that you think would have cop on believing in this,"" he said. Mr Kenny added that there is a ""big problem"" with social media companies ""feeding the conspiratorial nonsense"". * This article was originally published on Extra.ie.",0,1

The Georgia Tech - Florida State University match up on Saturday will be the ninth NCAA-sanctioned American college football game since the inaugural game in 1988 to mark the Dublin millennium. Georgia Tech returns to Dublin for a second visit following their victory against Boston College in 2016, while this game will be the first on Irish soil for Florida State University.

Speaking ahead of the game, the Tánaiste said on Friday: “2024 is an important year as we mark 100 years of diplomatic relations between Ireland and the US. ""The strength of the bilateral relationship is largely rooted in the many links between Irish and American people, and the Government is pleased to welcome fans from both teams to Dublin, with some 25,000 American spectators expected to travel for the sell-out game. “Among the football fans travelling, the Government looks forward to welcoming trade delegations and bipartisan delegations of both federal and state-level politicians, providing an opportunity for exchanges between Ireland and US counterparts."" The Tánaiste added, “The College Football Classic reinforces the strong relationship between America and Ireland and the Government hopes that our visitors will experience a warm Irish welcome I wish both teams the very best of luck in the game.” Earlier in August, organizers said 47,000 tickets had been sold for this year's Aer Lingus College Classic, making the event a sell-out for the second year in a row. That figure includes over 25,000 Americans who will journey to the nation’s capital to attend ‘week zero’ of the US college football season. The Aer Lingus College Football Classic has consistently boosted Ireland’s economy, according to Grant Thornton’s Post-Game Economic Impact Reports. Last year’s game between Navy and Notre Dame generated a record €180 million for the local Irish economy, while organizers have projected an economic impact in excess of €115 million for this year’s game.

2024/8/28,"Ireland is “antisemitic” and “supports Muslim terror,” Florida politician claims Florida State Rep Randy Fine has been fiercely critical of Ireland since its recognition of Palestine, though Jewish people in Ireland have more nuanced views. Florida State Representative Randy Fine, critical of Governor Ron DeSantis's recent trip to Dublin, has doubled down on his claims that Ireland is ""antisemitic"" and ""supports Muslim terror."" DeSantis was in Dublin this past weekend amidst the Aer Lingus College Football Classic, which ultimately saw Georgia Tech upset Florida State University 24 - 21. On social media, DeSantis said he and a team from the Florida Department of Commerce enjoyed meeting business leaders in Dublin ahead of the American college football game, noting that ""a number of Irish businesses are interested in coming to Florida or expanding their Florida footprint."" The @FLACommerce team and I enjoyed meeting with business leaders ahead of the 2024 Aer Lingus College Football Classic in Dublin, Ireland. A number of Irish businesses are interested in coming to Florida or expanding their Florida footprint. And why not? Florida has the #1… pic.twitter.com/O6GQCJcUDm “I was certainly disappointed to see not only folks go to what is clearly an antisemitic country that supports Muslim terror, but I was also disappointed that the game wasn’t cancelled, which it should have been,” Fine told the USA TODAY Network – Florida on Tuesday. USA Today noted that Fine is the Legislature’s only Jewish Republican. Fine further said: “Fighting antisemitism often as a lone ranger, it’s like Whac-A-Mole, and every day I have to tackle some new issue in state government, local government or private industry and there’s unfortunately more to be done. “The fact that the state thought it was a good idea to have a football game in a place that supports Muslim terror shows the depth of the problem.” USA Today went on to report that DeSantis responded to Fine's recent comments saying: ""I think just about every lobbyist in Tallahassee made that trip, so is Rep. Fine going to stop taking the money from all the lobbyists like he’s been doing? ""I'd like to see his answer to that."" Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! In May, Fine had similarly critical words for Ireland after Taoiseach Simon Harris announced the country would be joining Spain and Norway in formally recognizing the State of Palestine. As part of his announcement on May 22, the Taoiseach said: ""Let me be clear that Ireland condemns the barbaric massacre carried out by Hamas on October 7th last. Civilians attacked and murdered. Hostages taken in the most brutal and terrifying of circumstances, including a young Israeli-Irish child [Emily Hand]."" The Taoiseach further said: ""It is long past time for a ceasefire, for the unconditional release of hostages and for unhindered access for humanitarian aid."" Including Ireland, Spain, and Norway, 145 out of the 193 UN member states have now recognized a Palestinian state. The US has not. Reacting to Ireland's announcement, Fine posted on X that day how he and his family were in Ireland last summer and ""marveled"" at how welcoming it was. ""This morning, I wonder how we would have been treated if they knew we were Jews,"" he said in his post. ""Very sad to see Ireland embrace Muslim terror."" (Fine's post is now under 'limited visibility' as it ""may violate X’s rules against Hateful Conduct."") Last summer, my family visited Ireland. At the time, we marveled at how welcoming everyone was to us as Americans. This morning, I wonder how we would have been treated if they knew we were Jews. Very sad to see Ireland embrace Muslim terror. Later that day, Fine posted again: ""In Florida, if you support Muslim terror, you will be treated like a Muslim terrorist. ""Next session, I will introduce legislation that adds any country that recognizes 'Palestine' to Florida's list of scrutized [sp] countries, with severe limitations on entities from those countries doing business with and in Florida. ""Spain, Ireland, and Norway will join Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and Syria, among others, on that list. ""Govern yourselves accordingly."" In Florida, if you support Muslim terror, you will be treated like a Muslim terrorist. Next session, I will introduce legislation that adds any country that recognizes ""Palestine"" to Florida's list of scrutized countries, with severe limitations on entities from those countries… Fine told USA Today on Tuesday that he still intends to introduce such legislation. Meanwhile, Fine regularly uses the hashtag #BombsAway on X when positing about the war in Gaza. As it should be. Release the hostages and surrender. #BombsAway https://t.co/L0DUMqnaTb Ireland is, in general, pro-Palestinian. In October, President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins said there was a need for ""sophisticated, honest, straight discussion"" when it came to criticizing Israel, but added that ""nobody should tolerate antisemitism for a moment."" In November, an Ireland Thinks poll for the Sunday Independent found that 51% of respondents sided with Palestine. The same poll found that 65% of respondents supported Ireland proscribing Hamas as a terrorist organization. Later, in February, another Ireland Thinks poll for the Sunday Independent found that 79% of respondents believed Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. In March, Ireland's then-Taoiseach Leo Varadkar explained while in Washington, DC: ""Leaders often ask me why the Irish have such empathy for the Palestinian people. And the answer is simple: We see our history in their eyes. “A story of displacement, of dispossession, national identity questioned or denied, forced emigration, discrimination, and now, hunger.” Varadkar was in the US despite calls for Irish politicians to boycott the annual St. Patrick's Day events over the US response to the war in Gaza. While in Washington, Vardakar made headlines when Biden, in front of reporters, agreed with the Taoiseach that it was time for a ceasefire. In May, Biden put forth a plan to deliver a ceasefire which Taoiseach Simon Harris described as ""an opportunity that should not be missed."" On August 20, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that, after some clarifications, Israel had accepted the proposal and that he was hoping Hamas would do the same. Coincidentally, Fine's most recent comments about Ireland being ""antisemitic"" came the same day the Jewish News Syndicate (JNS) published an article about Jewish people in Ireland, which ultimately portrayed the community's attitudes as rather nuanced. ""Ireland’s Jews feel safe but concerned,"" the article's headline reads. It notes that Ireland's Jewish community only numbers 2,200. Maurice Cohen, chair of the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland, told JNS: “We have a very close relationship with the police force. We have access to senior politicians. But our concerns are not always heard with regard, for instance, to antisemitism in education. “Still, going around wearing a kippah is relatively safe. We had no incidents of physical violence, and every single politician I met at the top level said that they won’t stand for that,” he continued. “They say that the Jewish community here is very valuable and as much a part of Ireland as any race or religion, but then in the same speech criticize the war in Gaza. They just connect the two,” he added. Cohen went on to say that the Israeli Foreign Ministry acted ""very childishly"" when it recalled its Ambassador, Dana Erlich, after Ireland moved to formally recognize Palestine. ""It serves no purpose,"" Cohen told JNS. ""The ambassador is better off on the ground having her voice heard than not being here. “She can do her work, meet with officials, the media or other ambassadors,” he added. JNS also spoke with Sivan Yousef, who grew up in Israel and moved to Ireland 20 years ago. She recently met with Ireland's Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin alongside other representatives of the Jewish community. Yousef, who believes Ireland's recognition of Palestine is 'misguided,' said Martin ""sat down and listened to representatives from the Jewish community for two hours. ""I felt I was speaking to someone who just wanted peace."" However, she continued, “When Ireland gives €13 million to the Palestinian side and when Palestinian flags are flown all over the place, this is not sending a message of peace. This is telling the world that you are being one-sided.” Yousef told JNS that she believes the Irish people ""don't get"" Jewish people's story and that the media hasn't covered their side enough. Still, Yousef admitted she received messages of support following the October 7 attacks. “After Oct. 7, I started getting messages asking me how everybody was doing back home and sending regards,” she said, adding, “When I go to Israel, I have to explain how wonderful Ireland is and how wonderful the people are. ""The position that the government decided to adopt does not necessarily represent the people who actually approached me and genuinely cared.” Rifka Lent, who has lived in Ireland for 24 years and runs the Chabad house in Dublin with her husband, shared similar sentiments with JNS. “I do think Israelis see Ireland as much more antisemitic than it is,” she said. “I don’t know why that is. Maybe they feel Ireland shouldn’t be so anti-Israel and they feel betrayed in some ways."" She continued: “I’m not so happy with the way the Irish government is dealing with it, [but] I also understand that there are fewer Jews than there are Muslims. Politicians do things for the majority. ""This explains a lot of antisemitism in the world.""",0,1

""Further incidents can occur without notice and there is potential for intense escalation; extreme caution is advised."" The DFA notes that ""Israeli law permits immigration officials to deny entry to foreign nationals who have publicly called for a boycott of Israel and/or settlements, or who belong to an organisation which has called for such a boycott."" Irish citizens currently in Israel or Palestine who have not already done so, are asked to register on the Department’s Citizens Registration platform here. In its updated travel advice for Lebanon, the DFA is strongly advising against all travel to the country and strongly advising Irish citizens to leave the country. ""The situation in Lebanon remains highly volatile with intensifying clashes along the southern border in recent weeks,"" the DFA says. ""In light of the unpredictability of the situation, events could escalate throughout the country with very little warning. This could affect exit routes out of Lebanon.

A demand was issued last night, August 4, to expel Russian diplomats, after a senior Garda revealed Russia is spying on Ireland and attempting to spark unrest and anger here. Garda Assistant Commissioner Michael McElgunn, who is in charge of the unit for State security, claimed that some ""states are involved in spying activities on sovereign soil with malign intent."" He said the nations which are spying are attempting to create mistrust of Ireland, both domestically and internationally. Mr. McElgunn explained the intent is to ""influence, create distrust in Government and support extremist groups within a state with that same end goal in mind. ""They will involve themselves in trying to steal secrets from the State, or steal secrets from industry within the State which undermines the reputation of a country."" Mr. McElgunn said: ""That activity is of concern, we closely monitor individuals who we believe to be involved in that activity. ""We work very closely internationally in that regard because a lot of these hostile state agents will move and we work with our colleagues to have an understanding of who might be in our state from time to time and to manage entry in and out of the state by people of that nature."" Mr McElgunn said he was ""cautious in what he said"" because Ireland maintained diplomatic relations with the countries. ""However, if we look at the [2018 poisonings] in Salisbury in the UK, if we look at other events there, if we look at events in Europe and we look at the Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine, I don’t think too many will be surprised if I were to say Russia is one of these states.""

Former deputy head of the Army Ranger wing turned Independent TD for Kildare South Cathal Berry has called for Russian diplomats to be expelled from Ireland, given the threat posed by Moscow. Speaking to the Irish Daily Mail on Sunday night, Mr. Berry said that while the numbers operating in the Russian embassy in Dublin have dropped from about 30 to 14 in the past two years, there is ""absolutely"" a need to reduce it further. He added: ""Absolutely grounds for further reductions, it should be matched numbers, so only the same amount as we have in our embassy in Moscow. ""Russia is carpet bombing every social media account in Ireland right now, finding impressionable accounts and feeding them more information that confirms their bias. ""Ireland is a playground for Russia, we sit between three of the Five Eyes [intelligence community consisting of USA, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Germany], member of the European Union, and geographically you couldn’t think of a better place to conduct hybrid operation [from a Russian perspective]. These activities include the weaponization of migration, election interference, attacks on infrastructure, airports or influencing social and mainstream media."" Mr. Berry pointed to the lack of National Security Strategy, as a major flaw in the Irish security apparatus. He said: ""We’re one of the few countries that don’t have one. Our entire intelligence architecture is decades behind any peer country, any advanced western democracy."" Queried about the activities of China, Mr. McElgunn said it had good relations with Ireland. Speaking on RTÉ Radio 1’s This Week programme, he said that the EU views China as an economic competitor, as a systemic rival on the world stage. He added: ""But, I would say China is a huge global superpower as well. Having said that, we have good relations with China. ""China’s worldview is a little different from what it is in the western world and, as a consequence of that, elements of the Chinese Communist Party’s foreign policy are of interest to many, if not the majority of western intelligence agencies."" Earlier this year, French officials warned the Department of Foreign Affairs about efforts by Russia to extend its disinformation activities into Ireland in the run-up to June’s European elections. The network of Russian websites and social media accounts was first revealed last February when French security officials from Viginum, a newly formed agency, alleged Moscow was using it to sow discord in France and other EU countries by exploiting grievances around divisive issues such as immigration. A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman previously said it was aware of the ""pro-Russian Portal Kombat campaign recently uncovered by Viginum,"" and said such activities were ""completely unacceptable."" The spokesman added that the Department was in ongoing contact with other Government departments on the issue of foreign interference, and that Ireland worked closely with other EU states on the issue.

GAA President Jarlath Burns says the sporting organization supports Cork's Páírc Uí Chaoimh being used as a venue for the Euro 2028 after funding was pulled for the redevelopment of Casement Park in Belfast. Located in West Belfast, Casement Park was one of ten stadiums in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and England selected to host Euro 2028. It was the only Northern Irish venue to be selected for the competition. However, Northern Ireland's Secretary of State Hilary Benn and Northern Ireland's Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Lisa Nandy confirmed on September 13 that they have ""regrettably decided that it is not appropriate for the UK Government to provide funding to seek to build Casement Park in time to host matches at EURO 2028,"" citing timing and rising costs.

In the wake of the news, Tánaiste Micheál Martin told reporters on Tuesday that he and Ireland's Minister for Sport Thomas Byrne ""have raised with the powers-that-be the prospect perhaps of another fixture in the Euros, perhaps Páirc Uí Chaoimh could be.""

On Wednesday, Burns, who previously shared his skepticism that Casement Park would be completed in time, said the GAA was on board with the Cork venue. “Obviously, we in the GAA would be very supportive of that,” he said on Wednesday at a Hurling Development Committee media briefing. “I have to give credit to the Tanaiste Michéal Martin and the Minister for Sport because I only mentioned it to Michéal Martin three days ago.

According to the Department of Health, it is estimated that Ireland will receive up to 30 pediatric patients from Gaza in 2024. The health needs are categorized under cancer, hemodialysis, and patients with other severe medical conditions (except for orthopedics to ensure there is no impact on HSE efforts to increase the number of procedures being carried out in this speciality). Ireland will be opting in on a case-by-case basis for each child who requires treatment, subject to the necessary capacity being available at that time, the Department said. Under this initiative, the children will travel with a carer, who will be accommodated in accommodation managed by the IRC. This includes accommodation owned by healthcare workers as well as accommodation being provided via the IRC. The care package being provided includes caseworker and translation services to ensure that patients and their carers are well looked after and have assistance in accessing all services as needed. In addition, the HSE will provide appropriate psycho-social assessment for both patients and carers. All patients and carers are required to get health screening prior to travel.

However, following last week’s ruling, the Coalition leaders and finance ministers met on Tuesday and agreed the windfall should be spent on State infrastructure - housing, roads, and water supply. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! At a Fine Gael parliamentary party meeting, Taoiseach Simon Harris told colleagues the ""principles and parameters"" on how the fund will be allocated will be set out on Budget Day. He also added that it was ""completely wrong"" to suggest the windfall could have been collected by the State prior to last week’s court ruling. The Taoiseach has since declared that the monumental sum will be spent on ""infrastructure and investments which can improve our future."" Outlining a meeting with the Coalition leaders along with Finance Minister Jack Chambers and Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe, the government set out how the budget will utilize €1.8bn in additional expenditure and a €1.4bn tax package. The party leader added that this year’s tax package will follow suit with last year’s, which saw the entry point to the top level of tax increase along with cuts to the USC [Universal Social Charge]. Mr. Harris also confirmed the cost of living package will be paid prior to the Christmas period, which includes lump sum payments of social welfare and education supports. Additionally, there will be a major infrastructure package to tackle housing demands. Issues regarding childcare, school transport, road infrastructure, healthcare, farming, and VAT were also raised by TDs and senators. *This article was originally published on Extra.ie.",0,1

2024/9/23,"President Michael D. Higgins accuses Israel of leaking his Iran letter The President has accused Israel of leaking a letter from him to the new leader of Iran. Michael D. Higgins’s letter was first published by London-based publication The Jewish Chronicle and drew criticism from Fine Gael TDs at the time. Asked about the letter, Mr Higgins urged reporters to ""ask where it came from"". Asked by the Irish Daily Mail why he didn’t tell reporters present, as he clearly knew who had leaked it, he said: ""I do indeed, it was circulated from the Israeli embassy."" However, senior Israeli figures said they were baffled by the accusation, adding: ""This has gone beyond absurd. We learned about it from the media and only then did we comment."" Asked how they had obtained it, Mr Higgins said: ""I have no idea. It’s very simple, one of your journalists got it from the Israeli embassy and then someone rang me and asked if I was concerned and I wasn’t concerned for a second.""

One Israeli source said: ""We thought that all of the correspondence of the President was in the public domain."" Speaking at the UN in New York, Mr Higgins said people should ask how the letter was ""circulated"" and ""by whom and for what purpose"".

Mr Higgins said: ""I wrote to him as the newly-elected head of State, as I’ve often done before with other elected heads of states, my letter has been acknowledged by the president. ""My letter was standard, that I have written to many heads of state, and what I stressed in it was the importance of peace in the region and the importance as well as diplomacy returning in relation to the resolution of disputes and so forth."" The diplomatic spat comes as Mr Higgins also openly criticized the Government over its housing and immigration record. Mr Higgins also said he was not able to engage with the Israeli ambassador on the letter issue as she is no longer in Ireland. The Israeli government recalled its ambassador to Ireland in May after Ireland formally recognized the state of Palestine. Mr Higgins said: ""I’m afraid she [ambassador Dana Erlich] is not in residence at the moment."" Late on Sunday night, in response to questions on the leak, a spokesman for Mr Higgins said: ""The exchange of letters upon the coming to office of a new head of state is standard diplomatic practice for countries which share diplomatic relations. ""In response to questions, the President indicated his view that this standard diplomatic letter had been circulated over the summer and presented as being something out of the ordinary. ""The President made no accusations of a leak, he solely referred to the letter being circulated."" Mr Higgins has been a strong voice on the plight of the Palestinians since the outbreak of the war in the Gaza Strip last year. Speaking back in March, he said: ""The situation we are now witnessing in Gaza is one from which the global public must not be distracted or avert its gaze. ""It is a matter of life and death. The blockading of food and aid must immediately be stopped."" And in April, he said he was in ""no doubt whatsoever"" that there are ""clear"" breaches of international law occurring in Palestine.

This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous and the embassy rejects it completely. ""The fact remains that the letter was written and therefore it is the burden of the author to defend its content, which did not mention the threat Iran poses in the region, that it calls for Israel’s destruction, that it arms and funds terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, not to mention the violations of human rights against its own citizens.""

He added that the Government tends not to comment on the views of the President.

Asked if Mr Higgins was writing in a personal or presidential capacity, the Taoiseach said at the time: ‘He’s speaking as the President of Ireland.

2024/9/24,"President of Ireland hits back in Israel letter row President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins says he is not ""responsible for the misuse of my language"" in the Israel letter row. President of Ireland Michael D Higgins has accused the Israeli embassy of engaging in ""improper"" and ""unusual"" practices by publicly criticising a letter he sent to the Iranian president. In a tense press conference on Monday, the President also accused the media of putting ""spin"" on his comments on Sunday where it was widely reported that he believed that the Israelis had ""leaked"" his letter to the Iranian president. President Higgins had in fact said that he believes the Israelis had circulated, not leaked, the letter where he sent his congratulations to Masoud Pezeshkian as a new head of state in July.

On Monday, the Government sought to dampen the row with both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste robustly defending President Higgins. When asked if he had any regrets about his comments, the President said ""not at all."" He said it was a ""normal letter."" He added: ""For example, the text, much of it is, in fact, supplied to me by the Department of Foreign Affairs. And the point is, is that a statement was issued from the [Israeli] embassy saying that the President has written and why hasn’t he said this? ""And frankly, that was unusual, and many would regard it in diplomatic circles as improper. That is all I wish to say on this matter."" He said that he wanted to focus about world poverty and the issues regarding matters at the UN, as he is in New York this week. The President then initially interrupted the Irish Daily Mail when it began its question on the Israeli issue, saying: ""The implication falls on you, as it does on me, that we use our time to discuss what the United Nations is doing."" Asked if he wants to apologise for his use of language which led every major news outlet in the country to believe that he thought the Israelis had leaked his letter, he said: ""I did not use the word leaked, and I used the word circulating, and we have confirmed that. And really it is your responsibility if you decide to spin on the language, you take every responsibility for your language."" Pressed on whether he was accusing the media of engaging in bad faith, he said: ""Please. I’m the President. It’s not my business to be commenting on journalism or editorial responsibility. You look after yourself. I tried to look after the issues that are being discussed at the United Nations. ""I’m not responsible for the misuse of my language."" He also confirmed that he had written similar letters to the new heads of state in countries like Italy and Argentina who have had rightwing leaders elected in recent times. In the letter, President Higgins told Mr. Pezeshkian that Iran had a ""crucial role"" in peace in the Middle East following the death of his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash in May. ""I regret of course the circumstances that brought about the election, and take the opportunity to repeat the condolences of the people of Ireland for the deaths of your predecessor President Raisi,"" the letter read. It appeared in the Jewish Chronicle and prompted criticism in both the UK and Ireland. Mr. Higgins was strongly defended by both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste yesterday. Simon Harris said: ""I’ve just come from a meeting where the Palestinian prime minister has broken down about children in his own country being killed by Israel today, and there are at least 21 children who have been killed by Israel in Lebanon today. ""You’ll excuse me for not getting overly exercised about the issue of a letter. I dealt with this very clearly yesterday. The President of Ireland did not suggest that Israel leaked a letter. ""The President suggested that they circulated it… Where the letter came from, is utterly irrelevant to the issue at hand. What is relevant is that a State is today carrying out catastrophic actions against children. This isn’t pen pals international. ""This is a situation where children are dying because of the blatant breaching of international law. And look, it’s clear, nobody’s suggesting, I’m certainly not suggesting that Israel leaked the letter, but it certainly, certainly was being amplified by Israel. I think that’s clear."" Tánaiste Micheál Martin said: ""The President has made his remarks. I don’t want to embroil the Presidency in any further controversy other than to say this. In the context of Middle Eastern politics, let’s not be naive. And there was various commentary on that letter. The letter was a standard diplomatic letter that would be issued to any new head of state."" He added: ""I felt it was an undue and unfair criticism of the President at the time the letter was issued."" *This article was originally published on Extra.ie.",0,1

2024/9/5,"Hundreds of thousands of women to get free HRT in Ireland Tanaiste Micheál Martin has confirmed that further details about free hormone replacement therapy for women will be disclosed soon. Hundreds of thousands of women in Ireland will be entitled to free hormone replacement therapy (HRT) within a matter of weeks under plans that have just been rubber-stamped by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly. HRT is a prescription medication used to alleviate symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, vaginal dryness, and reduced sex drive. The treatment can come in patches, gels, tablets, and creams and replaces hormones that decrease during perimenopause and menopause. Sign up to IrishCentral's newsletter to stay up-to-date with everything Irish! Tanaiste Micheál Martin confirmed the news to EVOKE on September 4, saying there will be a ""detailed announcement in respect of it in the coming week but free HRT is on the way."" Speaking about Minister Donnelly's plans, the Tanaiste continued ""he has the funding and the estimates to do it, the detail will be fleshed out as to whether he can do it all at once or if it will have to be phased like contraception was for example. ""But it is part of a broader programme that Stephen Donnelly has embarked upon for the last two years in terms of women's health care and he has really focused on that more than any previous Minister in my view."" There are more than 500,000 women currently between the ages of 45 and 64 in Ireland, now eligible for the scheme which will see the HRT covered but not the doctor's prescription. HRT varies between €30 and €70 per month, and up to now has only been given free to women who have a medical card. *This article was originally published on Evoke.ie.",0,1
